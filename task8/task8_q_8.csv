(2) The period over which individuals are resampled must exceed that of the infectious period (and therefore the infectious period must be known). (3) The host's lifetime must far exceed the infectious period. (4) Pathogen must be detectable without lethal sampling. It is our contention that, if these conditions are met, it should be possible to distinguish among scenarios. In a population with waning immunity and cyclical reinfection, the probability that a given individual becomes infected is expected to be equal to the prevalence of infection among other individuals of similar age and the same sex. Therefore, past infection status is not expected to predict present infection status. In contrast, if individuals are persistently infected but shed episodically, the prevalence of infection among previously positive individuals will be higher than among the population, and past infection increases the likelihood of positive infection status (Table 1) . However, large sample sizes and intermediate levels of prevalence probably are required to distinguish cyclical reinfection from persistent infections, and alternative explanations for patterns of prevalence may be difficult to reject. For example, the individuals most likely to be exposed may appear to be persistently infected.

First the vaccine should elicit an immune response that rapidly clears the pathogen (i.e. the rate constant for clearance of the pathogen, call it k P , is high). Second, the vaccine should elicit a large response to this antigen. This requires that the antigen rapidly elicits immunity (i.e. has low ϕ X , and in terms of immunology it should be an immunogenic antigen), and also requires a high vaccine viral load to generate a large response. Engineering this requires tackling a trade-off between avoiding vaccine clearance (i.e. having a low k X ) but allowing for rapid clearance of the pathogen (having a high k P ). Vaccines designed to express the antigen in a form that is different from that in the pathogen might help solve this problem. Thus, to elicit immunity to influenza, one might design secreted forms of the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase proteins. A recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is secreted rather than on the virion surface would prevent the antibody response to this protein from clearing the recombinant vector vaccine (have low k X ) without compromising the clearance of the influenza virus pathogen which has hemagglutinin on its surface (i.e. has high k P ). In this manner our model allows the identification and tuning of parameters that affect vaccine efficacy, and a comprehensive search of parameter space would identify ideal combinations of vaccine properties.",19.419626943189733,11.1046426506555

Similarly, rotavirus load correlates with disease severity among children with gastroenteritis [20] . Because of the crucial role of microbial replication in viral pathogenesis, the value of pathogen load quantitation could be most clearly established for gastrointestinal illnesses of viral etiology, although some evidence is available for bacterial infections as well.

The latter is a much more accurate indicator of the infectious potential of a bioaerosol but is infrequently performed due to poor sensitivity and other technical issues (53) . The development of sampling devices and techniques optimized to preserve pathogen viability would considerably advance the utility of studying bioaerosols for risk assessment and management. For other applications, a more rapid, field-ready point of care test would be useful and would offer remote sampling possibilities. Biosensors have the potential to fill this gap and integration into aerosol sampling devices is under development (26) .

There have been no reports of such a significant outbreak in countries outside the Middle East experiencing importation of MERS-CoV [3] . In the 2013 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, one patient transmitted MERS-CoV to seven other persons, raising concerns about a potential super-spreader [9] . In the Korean outbreak, 5 patients, including the first case, were reported to be super-spreaders, transmitting the virus to 153 out of 186 MERS patients [1] . What makes certain hosts become super-spreaders remains unclear. Host, pathogen, and environmental factors may be implicated in the MERS outbreak [10] . In the first case, prolonged duration of exposure before diagnosis and proper isolation and frequent inter-hospital transfer may have contributed to the super-spreading event. Higher pathogen shedding may also have contributed to the spread because the patient developed severe pneumonia and the severe cough and high viral load could facilitate infection transmission. Additionally, nosocomial transmission by healthcare workers or environmental factors, such as inadequate ventilation, could be responsible. Kim, et al. reported that the MERS-CoV was confirmed by RT-PCR of viral cultures of air samples and environmental surface swabs from hospital B, suggesting the possibility of contact and airborne transmission [11] .

An earlier study, which analyzed HCV kinetics during and immediately after LT, found a sharp decrease in HCV viral load during the anhepatic phase and immediately after graft reperfusion [3] . This decrease was presumably attributed to massive binding of HCV to the hepatocytes. In other words, reinfection is immediate after reperfusion. Powers et al. also reported that HCV RNA levels dropped with an average half-life of 0.8 hours during the anhepatic phase [14] . The authors also mentioned that viral loads then continued to drop up to 23 hours after implantation, and began to rise as soon as 15 hours after the anhepatic phase.

The ability to comprehensively detect the important biothreat clusters with resolution sufficient to distinguish the near neighbors with an extremely low false positive rate is required. A technological solution to this problem can be achieved by coupling biothreat group-specific PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The biothreat assay described here detects ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters on the NIAID priority pathogen and HHS/USDA select agent lists. Detection of each of the biothreat clusters was validated by analysis of a broad collection of biothreat organisms and near neighbors prepared by spiking biothreat nucleic acids into nucleic acids extracted from filtered environmental air. Analytical experiments were carried out to determine breadth of coverage, limits of detection, linearity, sensitivity, and specificity. Further, the assay breadth was demonstrated by testing a diverse collection of organisms from each biothreat cluster. The biothreat assay as configured was able to detect all the target organism clusters and did not misidentify any of the nearneighbor organisms as threats. Coupling biothreat cluster-specific PCR to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry simultaneously provides the breadth of coverage, discrimination of near neighbors, and an extremely low false positive rate due to the requirement that an amplicon with a precise base composition of a biothreat agent be detected by mass spectrometry.",22.116596136004084,12.87523097368938

The dynamics of this model are shown in [151] , in which infection is treated as a microepidemic and host cells play the role of infected or susceptible individuals. Whether the virus infection can spread in the cell pool or not depends on a condition very similar to the spread of an epidemic in a population of individuals. The parameters of the model must satisfy the inequality R 0 > 1, where R 0 is the basic reproductive number, defined as the number of newly infected cells that arise from any one infected cell when almost all cells are uninfected [144, 151] . For a' = cp/b, this number is given by For generic parameters, if R 0 > 1 uninfected cells become infected and produce progeny viruses exponentially. Activation of the immune system (a' > 1) reduces the value of R 0 and slows down the spread of the infection. At the beginning of the infection, before the immune response is mounted (a' ≈ 0), and after the initial peak of viral load, viruses and infected and uninfected cells reach a stable equilibrium termed viral set point ( Figure 3 ). While monitoring viral load of SIV in infected macaques, a correlation between the viral load at initial stages of the infection and the viral set point was observed [152, 153] . One can demonstrate that the equilibrium abundance of viruses, v*, and the logarithm of the virus load during the exponential growth phase, follow the linear relationship This result is important in HIV research, because several studies indicate that there is a positive correlation between viral load and disease progression.

Under such conditions, the infection will initially grow, but then viral load will rapidly decline and the infection will eventually be cleared from the organism. However, even if the vaccine induces an immune response that is not strong enough to reduce R 0 to a value below 1, it may still be beneficial. As described above, slowing down the initial exponential increase of the viral load has a negative effect on the viral set point. This type of imperfect vaccine is also called a therapeutic vaccine. In the case of HIV, it could help infected patients to control disease progression in two ways. First, it may reduce viral load during the chronic phase of the infection, and second it may reduce viremia below the threshold of inter-host virus transmission ( Figure 3 ) [137, 144, [155] [156] [157] .",20.948890040317288,9.963436562319288

As JEV was rapidly cleared from the blood after inoculation and was present in the lymphatic system during the preclinical phase, the effects of manidipine on infection of serum and the spleen were evaluated at earlier time points to detect whether the drug reduced the peripheral viral loads (20, 21) . As shown in Fig. 7C , manidipine had little effect on peripheral JEV infection, which indicated that manidipine protected the mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain. Similarly, apparent damage in the brain, including meningitis, perivascular cuffing, vacuolar degeneration, and glial nodules, was observed in the JEV-infected and vehicle-treated group on day 5 postinfection, while manidipine treatment remarkably alleviated these phenomena (Fig. 7D) . These results indicate that the alleviation of histopathological changes was accompanied by a reduction in the viral load as well as a reduction in the rate of mortality, further confirming the curative effects of manidipine on viral encephalitis.",22.062878073590547,13.262778059113167

Wild bat populations are vulnerable to multiple environmental stressors, including seasonal fluctuations in food availability, climatic-stressors, and anthropogenic disturbances (140) . Each of these environmental stressors can affect multiple barriers to pathogen spillover (23, 141) . For example, viral excretion dynamics may be driven by bat densities and contact with humans may be influenced by bat distributions (142) . The effect of environmental stressors on immune defense and subsequent pathogen shedding is an important phenomenon for spillover. Pulses of Hendra virus excretion from Pteropodid bats, and associated Hendra virus spillover to horses, have been coincident with severe food shortages for bats that are driven by climatic anomalies (143) . Moreover, seasonal lifehistory events such as pregnancy and lactation can induce physiological and energetic stress that influences antiviral activity (144) . Connections among nutritional stress, reproductive stress and increased Hendra virus seroprevalence were observed in little red flying foxes, Pteropus scapulatus (115) .

Soon after the infection, the immune response kicks in and initiates a decrease in viral load until a constant level, the so-called set point, is reached (Ho, 1996) . Within this second asymptomatic phase, the virus persists for years while CD4+ T cells continuously and slowly decline. The third and final phase is characterized by a gradual depletion in CD4+ T cells that is correlated with a strong increase in the viral plasma concentration leading to AIDS (Alizon and Magnus, 2012; Maartens et al., 2014) . During the asymptomatic phase, the viral set point is maintained by a balance in viral clearance and the total virion production rate (p total = cV). Therefore, a strong increase in viral load that is associated with a lower viral clearance rate indicates a stronger total viral production rate p total > cV, while a decrease in viral load refers to a higher clearance rate, p total < cV. Perturbations of this system equilibrium, e.g., by blocking viral production, lead to information on the rate constants and insights into the course of the viral infection and the potential of antiviral interventions (Perelson, 2002) . At steady state and in the absence of ART, it has been estimated that HIV is a rapidly replicating virus that produces 10 10 virions per day.

This method could detect 10 ng/ml of pure culture. Sensitivity was high because of the use of biotin-avidin signal amplification method [50] . A new sandwich ELISA based diagnostic study was performed during 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza pandemic.

They reported overall sensitivity (0.57) was higher of ELISA than rapid influenza diagnostic kit QuickVue Influenza A+B test (0.43).

In contrast, C57BL/6J mice had the highest amount of virus at 6.35x10 6 PFU per lung. Lung titers in the preCC mice ranged from below the limit of detection (100 PFU/lung) to over 10 8 PFU per lung, greatly exceeding the range of viral loads in the founder strains. Some preCC mice had viral loads in the lung below the 100 PFU limit of detection, despite having substantial weight loss. CAST/EiJ mice are extremely susceptible to SARS-CoV infection and do not survive until the day four post infection timepoint. Fig 1C shows the relationship between weight loss and lung titer at day four post infection. We found no correlation between viral load in the lung at day four post infection and weight loss (r = -0.014, p = 0.8938) when excluding those animals with viral loads below the limit of detection. When those animals were included in the analysis there is a significant, but not very explanatory correlation (r = -0.347, p = 0.00019) between the two phenotypes.",17.50321996382091,8.580873597263542

With a modified target cell-limited model, Ribeiro et al. (2010) investigated the very early plasma viremia post exposure to HIV in 47 HIV-positive patients. After a time delay of 24 h where the virus became detectable (>50 RNA copies per mL), simulations have shown an initial viral doubling time of 0.65 days. Viral load peaked at 10 6 HIV RNA copies per mL after 14 days. The subsequent viral decline was characterized by a virion half-life of 1.2 days (c = 0.6 day −1 ). Moreover, for this early infection stage, the authors calculated the basic reproductive ratio of R 0 ∼ 8, indicating rapid viral spread and the necessity of an early intervention in order to reduce viral spread and to prevent development of chronicity (Ribeiro et al., 2010) . By measuring the viral load in 10 HIV-positive patients for on average the first 100 days during primary infection, Stafford et al. (2000) have shown that the target cell-limited model is able to reproduce the interpatient variability within the highly dynamic initial phase post infection. The model simulations provided strong evidence that the initial viral load decline is due to a limitation in target cells with an estimated lifetime of 2.5 days (δ = 0.39 day −1 ) for infected virus-producing cells. However, the target cell-limited model was not able to mimic the data in all the patients equally well. Therefore, the authors suggested that processes not included in the model, such as an involvement of the immune response by CD8+ T cells or destruction of infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), might be associated with the stronger than predicted decrease of viral load observed in some patients (Stafford et al., 2000) .",18.00584192480663,7.295263355643619

We did not attempt to recover live viruses by cell culture. Although PCR methodology has limitations because it does not demonstrate the presence of infective virus, it is commonly used to detect the presence of a virus. Also limiting is that the total number of samples taken is relatively small (n = 94). Our sample collection took place within three hours of the daily traffic peaks, well within the reported survival times on surfaces associated with common respiratory viruses. However, whilst the Ct values in our study are similar to those for surface samples in other studies, e.g. [17] , these are relatively high, suggesting a low viral load on the surfaces that tested positive, and possibly not constituting the minimum infective dose. Likely due to the high Ct value, subtyping for the influenza A positive specimen was not successful and did not provide information on the origin of the viral strain and its epidemiological context. Alternatively sampling and recovery techniques may have been relatively inefficient, giving an illustration of the potential for transmission, but underestimating the true transmission potential of contaminated surfaces and air. Data concerning the infectious dose specifically for indirect contact are lacking [17] . Killingley and colleagues used a logical argument to conclude that their level of influenza A surface contamination on its own did not represent an infectious dose [17] . The reasoning was that as the copy count in their surface samples approximately only equated to that needed for aerosol transmission, and the likelihood that higher counts are required for indirect transmission, their surface contamination doses would not have been infective. In this study Ct values were similar to Killingley et al. [17] , so likewise it is reasonable to conclude that the environmental contamination we identified may not always (or ever) have constituted an infective dose. However, we are unable to determine precisely when each surface became contaminated, and therefore cannot exclude a higher viral load at an earlier time point. Likewise, we cannot establish the efficiency of our sampling technique and the readouts we have may be low due to sampling and recovery techniques. Notwithstanding, we establish the potential for virus transmission from several surfaces. On that basis we do not feel that the potential for transmission can be satisfactorily excluded based on our data.",25.885871795294847,12.365969828384475

This is consistent with a recent study by Fabian et al. who found that only 33% of infected persons exhale detectable viral RNA.

A total of 36,262 individual words and phrases from the titles, abstracts and author key words of publications were available for analysis from our dataset of 1,255 publications. These terms were then reduced to 24,023 multi-word phrases and composite terms (i.e. biotechnology, bionanotechnology) to focus on meaningful concepts and categories. The terms were then grouped using word stemming to capture variations of leading terms i.e. biological systems AND artificial biological systems or metabolic engineering AND metabolic pathway engineering. This method revealed that 356 terms capture 99% of records on synthetic biology. As we might expect, the top unifying term is synthetic biology. When synthetic biology was excluded the remaining 355 terms captured 88% of records providing sufficient accuracy for representation of the data. The 355 terms were then placed in a co-occurrence matrix that provides a quantitative measure of the number of records for each term (nodes) and the strength of connections between terms (edges). These relationships were then visualised using the open source Gephi network analysis software ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2 reveals that synthetic biology is concerned with biological systems using approaches from systems biology directed to biotechnology that involves gene expression, gene networks, metabolic engineering and genetic circuits, synthetic genes and synthetic networks. As we move from central terms to the outer periphery of the network less frequent terms such as biosafety, bioethics, and intellectual property emerge to reveal the wider spectrum of issues revolving around the core of synthetic biology. Figure 3 narrows the focus to the top ranking phrases and composite terms in more than 20 records across the dataset. In considering these results it may be tempting to widen the search criteria for synthetic biology to include additional top occurring key terms to enhance data capture. For example, synthetic biology is strongly associated with systems biology, protein engineering, genetic engineering and nanotechnology. However, synthetic biology would immediately be swamped by the results from these much larger fields. In practice, synthetic biology is being constructed from a combination of convergences and overlaps with other areas of science and technology, some of which, such as metabolic engineering, are new and emerging areas of research. Our understanding of the distinctiveness of synthetic biology is improved by removing dominant terms to expose underlying networks. This approach revealed the prominence of relations between genetic circuits, gene networks, synthetic genes, synthetic systems and gene regulatory networks [34, 35] . Viewed from this perspective synthetic biology is being constructed from a core of work around genetic circuits and networks.

A few general assumptions can be made at the outset about which types of assays will be needed to detect vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses and these will evolve over time. The typical go-to methods used for vaccine clinical assays are: antibody binding-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA); functional-virus neutralization or bactericidal; cellular-interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay (IFNγ-ELISpot) using the target antigen or antigen-derived peptide pools; and molecular or culture methods to detect the pathogen. The technologies used to develop and run these assays have improved over the years to allow for higher throughput, multiplexing, reduced sample volumes, and automation. Often, more tests of a larger variety are done early in a program and are then whittled down based on the usefulness of the data generated so that just the relevant few remain to support large trials and licensure [4] .",20.43591913561476,12.49605274938701

We investigated whether species' susceptibilities change with temperature and ask if susceptibility is greatest at different temperatures in different species. We infected 45 species of Drosophilidae with an RNA virus and measured how viral load changes with temperature. We found the host phylogeny explained a large proportion of the variation in viral load at each temperature, with strong phylogenetic correlations between viral loads across temperature. The variance in viral load increased with temperature, while the mean viral load did not. This suggests that as temperature increases the most susceptible species become more susceptible, and the least susceptible less so. We found no significant relationship between a species' susceptibility across temperatures, and proxies for thermal optima (critical thermal maximum and minimum or basal metabolic rate).

Therefore, in those species where viral load increases at higher temperatures the peak viral load itself must be increasing, rather than us effectively sampling the same growth curve but at a later time point. Likewise, in those species where viral load decreased at higher temperatures, viral load would need to first increase and then decrease, which we do not observe in a time course at 22˚C [41] . To check whether this also holds at higher temperatures we carried out a time course of infection in a subset of six of the 45 original experimental species at 27˚C, where we would expect the fastest transition between the rapid viral growth and the plateau phase of infection to occur (Fig B in S1 Text) .

We used CT max and CT min as proxies for thermal optima which, due to its multifaceted nature, is problematic to measure directly [84] [85] [86] . We also measured basal metabolic rate across three temperatures to see if the changes in viral load could be explained by general increases in enzymatic processes. We found that these measures were not significant predictors of the change in viral load with temperature. This may be driven by the fact that all temperature related traits are likely to be more complex than what any single measure can explore.

If we refer only to the ability of a technique to detect a pathogen or some of its molecular components in biological samples, some newly developed molecular techniques may be more sensitive than the reference techniques, (i.e., some ""false positives"", referring to the reference technique, may be true positives that have not been detected by this reference method). This situation may be met when the new technique is able to detect viral variants that could not be detected by previous methods and, in that case, corresponds to an actual improvement of the technique if the variants detected are true pathogens that can be implicated in ARIs. However, it can also be met when the new technique is able to detect a lower viral load. The actual clinical impact of an improved detection of low viral loads in respiratory samples has not been accurately evaluated and its medical significance at the acute phase of ARIs obviously requires to be further documented. Altogether, this indicates that the interpretation of evaluation scores should remain careful and open-minded. Accordingly, we have tried to build a comprehensive approach of the comparison of diagnostic kits that mixed reference to well established-and clinically evaluated-real-time PCR detection techniques (this included in the current study the Argene Respiratory Multi Well System r-gene low range kit for Core tests, which has been used for years for routine detection in medical virology laboratories; and a series of published home-brewed techniques) and analysis of convergent positive results. For the latter, we considered that, given (i) the intrinsic high specificity of molecular amplification techniques, and (ii) the fact that the techniques compared used different technologies and amplification primers, the probability of obtaining false positive results with two different techniques for the same sample was negligible for an evaluation purpose. Consequently, samples in which a given pathogen was detected independently by two different techniques were declared positive for this pathogen, otherwise it was declared negative. We cannot exclude that a few samples were wrongly assigned a negative result (if a specific technique performed better than all others for a given pathogen), but the high degree of convergence between the different techniques suggests that the number of ""false negative"" results that could have been potentially generated is limited.",23.923285939332224,11.351927248947552

First, we do not consider the time of exposure to the infection. Therefore, short episodes of contacts are on the same footing as long standing contacts. This simplification is quite reasonable for viral diseases, as influenza, for which even short contacts can be sufficient for the transmission process. For other kind of infections, as the bacterial ones, the time of exposure is relevant for the transmission and thus one should properly include it in the model. Moreover, in the present study, the infectivity of the individuals is assumed to be constant during the entire infective period. In principle, one should consider the reduction of the viral load during the manifestation of the disease. There are examples in literature, in which the infectivity is a function of the time elapsed from the beginning of the infective period, as in Ref. [2] , where the infectivity is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution. Similarly, we do not consider the effect of the simultaneous presence of more than one infected individual in the neighborhood of the susceptible one: the probability of an individual to be infected does not depend on the number of her/his nearest neighbors, which are simultaneously infected, but only on the ageclass of the susceptible individual. Both these simplifications correspond to disregard the effect of the viral load in the infection process, which is indeed entirely ascribed to the immunological status of the susceptible individual. To disregard the viral load in the transmission process is acceptable for highly infective disease, as the influenza pandemic. However, the model can be easily ''upgraded'' in order to overcome all the previous limits, introducing a susceptible-infector dependent transmission rate, a variable infectivity, and to make the transmission rate dependent on the number of simultaneously infected nearest neighbors.",21.398710146844753,10.249021791771181

We thought that it would be important to determine whether the symptom of cough impacted that actual viral loads in a cough; therefore, we considered coughing by nonsymptomatic patients, by e.g., due to allergy, physiological stimulations, or causes other than influenza infection. Viral loads in the cough samples collected by voluntary coughing were compared between influenza cases with and without a symptom of coughing using throat swab samples as control ( Figure 6 ). The viral loads in the throat swabs were calculated from the viral load of the transport medium. The approximate quantity of the collected swab fluid was estimated by the increase of the weight of the cotton swab used for sample collection, which was based on the tentative assumption that the specific gravity of the sample was 1.0 and the sample absorbed in the cotton swab was almost completely washed out into the transport medium. The viral load of the cough in patients with the symptom of cough was higher than for those without it (median = 53.7 and 38.3, respectively). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.33, Mann-Whitney U test), as was seen with throat swab (median = 5644 and 6654, respectively; p = 0.79, Mann-Whitney U test). However, interestingly, several patients in the symptomatic group had higher viral loads than in the non-symptomatic group. In addition, we also found that the cases with the highest viral loads in the throat swab (plot numbers 1 and 2) had undetectable levels of viruses in the cough samples; thus, the highest viral load in a cough sample (plot numbers 4-6) did not necessarily correspond with the highest viral load in a throat swab ( Figure 6 ).

Of the HBoV1 single detection cases, the high viral load group was more prevalent than the low viral load group among the children with dyspnea and wheezing. The disease severity in the high viral load group was greater than the severity of the low viral load group. The 7 cases reported here suggest that a lower respiratory tract infection caused by HBoV1 single detection at a high viral load (≥10 7 copies/ mL) could lead to severe and life-threatening disease. HBoV1 could in some cases be a passenger in RTI, primarily in the low viral load group. HBoV1 co-detection with other respiratory viruses did not increase the severity of RTI.

When the patients' TSSS was grouped into three categories with scores that range from 1 to 8, 9-16, and 17-24 to reflect the relative symptom severity of mild, moderate, and severe, respectively [20] (Fig. 2b) , no significant differences in viral load between the three categories of symptom severity were observed.

We conducted this study for nearly 4 consecutive years, and samples were analyzed for 15 respiratory viruses by PCR and viral culture. The HBoV1 viral load was quantified by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The results suggest that HBoV1 at a high viral load (≥10 7 copies/mL) is not co-detected frequently with other respiratory viruses; there would be an association between HBoV1 single detection at a high viral load and SRTI. This study investigated the role of HBoV1 in RTI and found that 10.3% of the children with RTI were HBoV1 positive in the NPAs. Multiple studies have confirmed the presence of HBoV1 in respiratory tract samples of children world wide [7, 21, 22] . Some reports indicate that HBoV1 infection is associated with acute respiratory tract symptoms and that a high HBoV1 load (≥10 7 copies/mL) is associated with SRTI [14, 23] . In this study, HBoV1 low load was found significantly more frequently in children than was HBoV1 with a high viral load. The cases of SRTI in the patients with HBoV1 detection alone appeared to be particularly common among children with a high HBoV1 load. The stratification of the patients on the basis of the HBoV1 viral load ≥10 7 copies/mL versus <10 7 copies/mL in NPAs revealed that the presence of HBoV1 single detection at high (≥10 7 copies/mL)-but not at low (<10 7 copies/mL)-viral loads is associated with SRTI. Similarly, a case report described HBoV detection leading to SRTI [24] . Zhao found an association between disease severity and the HBoV1 viral load in co-detection children [14] . Our study reported an association between the HBoV1 high viral load and SRTI in single detection children. We confirmed HBoV1 single detection at a high viral load in 7 children. Two of them received treatment in ICU, including ventilator In most of the previous studies, the co-detection rate ranged from 18-72% [25] . In this study, of the HBoV1 positive samples, 48% were co-detected with other respiratory viruses (HBoV1-RV in 37 children, followed by HBoV1-ADV in 16 children and HBoV1-RSV in 13 children). This result is consistent with more recent studies. Martin reported that 35.3% of HBoV cases were co-infected, and 83.3% of them were HBoV-RSV coinfection [7] . Another study reported that RSV and RV were most frequently detected in conjunction with HBoV1 [26] , and ADV and enterovirus were more common in children with HBoV [5] . We compared HBoV1 single detection and co-detection, and the median level of HBoV1 load was greater in the subjects with HBoV1 infection alone than in the subjects with mixed respiratory viral infections. There were no differences in the clinical symptoms and severity. Co-detection with HBoV1 did not increase the severity of RTI. High viral loads of HBoV1 were noted predominantly in the absence of other viral agents, whereas co-detections were primarily found in low viral load cases. In severe cases, HBoV1 single detection was more prevalent among the children with a high viral load than those with a low viral load.",21.038555738144375,10.094518904770055

The use of an endogenous IC has allowed the validation of the use of swabs to detect the target pathogens. The level of a pathogen on a swab not only depends on the pathogen abundance at the site sampled but also on the amount of sample effort. However, it is reasonable to assume that this latter factor will also dictate the amount of reference DNA harvested. Hence, the use of an endogenous IC compensates for any variability in sample effort-a potential confounding factor when using swabs to collect samples. However, caution is required when comparing swabbed material with tissue samples. Relative quantification is the ratio of the target viral DNA (SQPV/SADV) to the reference squirrel DNA (PGK). Thus, if the sampling method harvests host cells poorly in comparison to viral particles, then an artificially high viral load may be indicated. This may, in part, explain why arm swabs yielded by far the highest RQ of SQPV in grey squirrels (Fig. 2) . Unsurprisingly, arm swabs show a poorer harvest of squirrel DNA in comparison to other sample types (Online Resource S10, Fig. S10.1 ). Yet, in terms of absolute quantities, arm swabs show a proportionally higher number of DNA copies of the SQPV target gene (Online Resource S10, Fig. S10.1) . Therefore, the high levels of SQPV in arm swabs appear genuine, a conclusion supported by the infection levels in skin sampled from the same site in red squirrels (see Figs. 2 and 3) .",25.041608743249732,12.947510302397385

The viral load among cases did not vary by age for most viruses, including RSV, but a significant trend toward decreasing viral load with increasing age was observed for a few viruses, including adenovirus and RSV, which was also observed among controls (Supplementary Figure 2) . A slight, but significant trend toward increasing viral load with increasing age was seen for rhinovirus among cases, but a significant trend in the opposite direction was observed for controls. In general, viral load did not vary by study site. One notable exception was higher PIV1 viral load in The Gambia site (the only site with a PIV1 outbreak, data not shown). HIV-infected cases had a higher mean viral load for coronavirus 43 and a lower viral load for HMPV, PIV3, and RSV (Supplementary Table 2 ). There were no significant differences in the viral load between cases who were normally nourished vs malnourished (except PIV1 viral load was higher in normally nourished, data not shown).",26.15287396704914,12.717263439183597

Added value can come from working with other disciplinary approaches; for example, for the natural sciences, understanding of the social factors shaping the dynamics of interest, as well as more explicit and effective addressing of policy issues within the research framework are obvious benefits from working with social sciences; for the social sciences, more detailed understanding of the biological processes of interest can both raise vital new questions and beneficially refine research approaches.

Moreover, only one of 7515 snails collected in these villages was found to be infected despite extensive surveys at the time, these human infections were diagnosed [1] .

Extensive research would, however, be required to first establish the necessary criteria. In addition, it should be stressed that in this particular application, microarray results would have to be viewed in terms of patterns for a group of genes rather than the expression levels of individual genes [9, 15] .

Within the infant group, viral load negatively correlated with age, corroborating the observation that newborns are more susceptible to CHIKV induced disease ( Figure 2A ). In adults, there was also an age-dependent trend with elderly harboring higher viral loads ( Figure 2A ). Again this is consistent with the report that increased age is a risk factor for severe CHIKV disease [44] . Next, we plotted plasma IFNa concentrations as a function of age. These data demonstrate a strong negative correlation in infants, and followed the pattern seen for CHIKV titers ( Figure 2B ). We found that IFNa levels correlated with viral loads in both group ( Figure 2C ). To normalize for CHIKV titers, we separated each cohort in two groups (,global median: low viral load; and . global median: high viral load); in both groups the levels of IFNa were more elevated in infected infants than in infected adults ( Figure 2D ). Furthermore, we performed univariate linear regression analysis to model the effect of infant status on plasma IFNa concentrations. Infants had higher IFNa concentrations Figure 1 . Serum concentration of IFN and IFN-induced chemokines is higher in CHIKV infected infants as compared to adults. Patient sera were obtained from acute CHIKV infected adults (age = 16-86 years) and infants (age = 2-5 months). Age matched controls from La Réunion were tested. Chemokines / cytokines were measured using a Luminex assay. (A) IFNa and IFNc levels; (B) IFN-induced molecules; and (C) Lymphocyte cell derived cytokines are shown. Whisker-box plots are shown (line indicates median; boxes represent first and third quartile; and bars define range). Mann-Whitney U-test was performed using a false discovery rate (FDR) procedure for generating corrected p-values. Comparisons were made between CHIKV patients versus their control cohort (in black); as well as adult versus infant patients (in red). ** indicates p,0.005, * indicates p,0.05. IFNa data from adult patients were previously reported [20] , but are shown here for comparison to data from infected neonates. doi: 10 Thus for a similar viral load, infants produce more IFNa than adults. To represent associations between age, viral load, IFNa and the immune signature, we established a network plot of significant correlations ( Figure 2E ). These data argue against infants being compromised in their response to CHIKV infection; however, we could not determine whether their IFN response was protective. To address this issue and to examine the mechanism of ISG mediated control of CHIKV, we exploited a recently described neonatal mouse model for studying infection [15] .",20.0040125954217,12.200658992710032

Solution-based capture methods followed by fluorescent detection or sequencing have generated quality data but can be confounded by sequence differences between viral species/ strains and can only detect viruses for which the capture panel is designed [4, 5] .

Nucleic acid amplification assays also allows easier determination of viral serotypes and quantification of viral load in clinical specimens. The determination of viral load is especially important for immunocompromised hosts who have a higher risk of developing severe and disseminated infections. It is now well established that high levels of HAdV DNAemia portends disseminated diseases and monitoring of viral load in peripheral blood and stool in susceptible hosts may have a role in early diagnosis and pre-emptive treatment of high risk individuals [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .

In particular, the number of Caco-2 cells infected with RV decreased in the presence of DS. In addition, the number of virions released in the culture medium was lower in cells infected with DS-treated RV rather than RV alone. This protective effect was maintained over three days following the infection.

NGS based metagenomics can be used to characterize the genomic landscape of complex biological or environmental samples without a priori knowledge of the microbial community [9] . Therefore, we determined if NGS-directed metagenomics approach could be used to detect pathogen-derived genetic signatures in field-collected samples. We found evidence of two potentially important animal viruses, EBV and CDV. EBV is a highly prevalent gamma-herpesvirus that infects B-lymphocytes and develops latency [36, 43] . Because of its tissue tropism and its associated reactivation during P. falciparum infections, it is not surprising that latent EBV infections of white blood cells would be readily detectable by our approach in a P. falciparum holoendemic region such as Liberia [43] . CDV is a morbillivirus (related to measles virus) and an emerging virus of veterinary significance. Spillover of CDV from domestic dogs has caused mass mortality in endangered African carnivores [44] [45] [46] . Detection of CDV from one mosquito that fed on a dog in a pool of 57 M-DBSs is important for two reasons. First, it demonstrates the sensitivity of using NGS to screen for pathogen signatures in pooled M-DBS. Second, it suggests that xenosurveillance may be useful for the detection of veterinary or zoonotic pathogens in areas where indoor-resting mosquitoes prefer to feed on domestic animals [47, 48] . Currently, the costs associated with NGS are impractically high for resource-poor regions; however, costs have been falling precipitously far outpacing the predictions associated with Moore's Law [49] . In addition to NGS, we demonstrated that viruses and bloodmeal sources could also be detected by more cost efficient PCRbased methods from pooled and individual M-DBSs, further broadening the utility of xenosurveillance.",23.810233463715065,13.476763215119334

It is advisable to sample a broad range of vertebrates and invertebrates at different temporospatial levels on a regular basis to detect possible candidate viruses at their natural source. However, virus surveillance systems can be expensive, costly in terms of finances and resources and inadequate for sampling sufficient numbers of different host species over space and time. Recent publications have presented the concept of a new virus surveillance system, coining the terms ""flying biological syringes"", ""xenosurveillance"" and ""vector-enabled metagenomics"". According to these novel and promising surveillance approaches, viral metagenomics on engorged mosquitoes might reflect the viral diversity of numerous mammals, birds and humans, combined in the mosquitoes' blood meal during feeding on the host. In this review article, we summarize the literature on vector-enabled metagenomics (VEM) techniques and its application in disease surveillance in humans.

The use of other methods to identify homology when the NCBI nt database does not have adequate representation available will be the second major area of improvement for the analytical pipelines used in this study. Further investigation of sample 1164 revealed that, by using the discontiguous megablast searching Most pathogens identified to date have had some sequence homology to previously identified pathogens, so it is very possible that etiological agents are being missed due to the lack of homology to existing known sequences [35] . Further, pathogen detection accuracy is important as environmental or sample contamination can lead to false pathogen discovery [36] . With increasing biosurveillance efforts in human and non-human populations, there will be large amounts of data generated that potentially contain novel pathogens with little or no homology to existing viruses [37, 38] . Less stringent nucleotide alignment approaches and BLASTx (translated nucleotide sequence to amino acid sequence) have the potential to detect some of these less homologous pathogens. However, many of these algorithms, such as BLASTx, are too computationally intensive to implement without heuristics or substantial dedicated computational resources. As more efficient algorithms are developed, such as the newly described DIAMOND [39] , they can be integrated into the existing analytical pipelines as well as pipelines developed elsewhere and hosted on Pathosphere. The current pipelines bin total contiguous sequences for the user to analyze further. This provides an area for future development, as identifying unknown contigs remains a critical area for pathogen identification and discovery. Pathosphere provides the necessary architecture to host the types of software programs that in the future will be needed to analyze data sets for unknown pathogens that contain little or no homology to pathogens described previously.

In contrast, among the Spanish patients [10] , 93% and 57% of the mild and critical cases respectively were positive for serum viral RNA, with no significant difference in the viral load. Both studies used CDC primers for real time PCR (http://www. who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/CDCRealtimeR TPCRprotocol_SwineH1Ass-2009_20090428) and the critical cases were bled when already on Oseltamivir treatment, negating sensitivity of the PCR, effect of antiviral therapy or delay in collection of samples to be responsible for different results.

Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming. Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load. Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample. VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus. VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load >2 × 10 4 RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples. Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load >10 4 DNA copies/mL were detected. Our results indicate that VIDISCA-NGS has the capacity to detect low load RNA viruses in CSF. Herpesvirus DNA in clinical samples is probably non-encapsidated and therefore difficult to detect by VIDISCA-NGS.",24.593497235346955,13.786795518367681

Low infectious dose and high viability in the environment are major challenges in eradication of this virus. To further understand the viability of PEDv in the infected manure, we longitudinally monitored survivability and infectivity of PEDv in two open earthen manure storages (EMS; previously referred to as lagoon) from two different infected swine farms identified in the province of Manitoba, Canada. Our study revealed that PEDv could survive up to 9 months in the infected EMS after the initial outbreak in the farm. The viral load varied among different layers of the EMS with an average of 1.1 × 10 5 copies/ml of EMS, independent of EMS temperature and pH. In both studied EMS, the evidence of viral replication was observed through increased viral load in the later weeks of the samplings while there was no new influx of infected manure into the EMS, which was suggestive of presence of potential alternative hosts for PEDv within the EMS. Decreasing infectivity of virus over time irrespective of increased viral load suggested the possibility of PEDv evolution within the EMS and perhaps in the new host that negatively impacted virus infectivity. Viral load in the top layer of the EMS was low and mostly non-infective suggesting that environmental factors, such as UV and sunlight, could diminish the replicability and infectivity of the virus. Thus, frequent agitation of the EMS that could expose virus to UV and sunlight might be a potential strategy for reduction of PEDv load and infectivity in the infected EMS.",21.357683352844802,12.755432629859358

In the fall sampling of farm-2 EMS, viral load was higher at the first week of sampling compared to the following 3 weeks. This was most likely due to active viral shedding, which was confirmed by fresh fecal samples (Table 1) at the beginning of the study as the barn was depopulated about 2 weeks after EMS sampling was started. After a long-winter incubation, the viral load significantly increased in the early spring (May 2015), but significantly declined in mid summer (July 2015). Beyond the existing knowledge that PEDv significantly survives longer in contaminated environments, the apparent increased viral copies in both studied EMS provides evidence for the ability of the virus to replicate outside its typical host, the swine. Although PEDv is believed to be a genuine pig virus, its ability to replicate in cells of non-swine origin has been reported since late . In 1988 , Hofmann and Wyler (1989 were the first to report replication of PEDv in kidney cells of monkey origin (VERO cells). Subsequently, Utiger et al. (1995) presented serological evidence that PEDv may circulate in humans and cats. A recent report verified that PEDv could replicate in duck intestinal cell line (Khatri, 2015) . To our knowledge, reservoirs of PEDv have not yet been discovered. Likewise, other swine viral pathogens could replicate in hosts of non-swine origin. However, in the current scenario, potential alternative hosts for PEDv in EMS are favored to be non-mammalian eukaryotes (e.g. protozoa or amoeba). EMS are natural inhabitants for most amoeba and protozoa in which a variety of viruses are able to replicate (Baron et al., 1980; Miles, 1988; Diamond, 1991; Wang and Wang, 1991a,b; Kasprzak and Majewska, 1995; Truong et al., 2013) .

Shortly after effective treatment, the decay rate of viral load approaches the death rate of productively infected cells. However, estimating the death rate of infected cells during the acute phase remains a challenging task, and, as a consequence, it is difficult to accurately estimate the basic reproduction number from viral load data during the early stages of viral infection. In addition to calculation of the basic reproduction number, the death rate per se is useful for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine-induced cellular immune responses during the acute phase of virus infection [14] [15] [16] .

These locations are shown in Figure 1 , and collaborating Vietnamese institutions are outlined in Box 2. Over a 3-year period of enrollment at each site, we aim to enroll up to 3000 hospitalized cases of each of four key clinical syndromes (central nervous system (CNS) infections, enteric infections, jaundice, and respiratory tract infections) that may be caused by a zoonotic pathogen. The aim to enroll 3000 cases under each clinical syndrome was based both on operational capacity and local epidemiology, specifically the ability to calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs) for specific pathogens (thus providing supporting evidence of disease etiology). These samples sizes were considered to be sufficient to estimate PAFs to informative levels of precision: for example, a pathogen found in 20% of 3000 cases and 40% of 1000 severe cases will give PAF = 33% with approximate 95% confidence intervals of 30-37%. From pilot data, we anticipated identifying a pathogen associated with the defined clinical syndromes in 50% of CNS cases, 60% of respiratory cases, 60% of enteric cases, and 30% of hepatitis cases; roughly 50-80% of these pathogens were predicted to be viruses. These enrollment targets should provide samples and metadata from known infections and provide >80% power to detect a pathogen that is present in just 1/ 1800 patients with a specified syndrome.",19.7027157043498,11.890175783959869

Specially, establishing whether invasive species operate within the constraint of conservative ecological niches, or if niche shifts occur at all commonly as part of the invasion process, is indispensable to identifying and anticipating potential areas of invasion. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has been used to address such questions, but improvements and debate in study design, model evaluation, and methods are still needed to mature this field. We reanalyze data for Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), native to North America, but invasive in Europe. Our main finding was that, when the analysis extent is established carefully based on analogous sets of environmental conditions, all evidence of niche shifts disappears, suggesting that previous reports of niche shifts for this species are artifacts of methods and interpretation, rather than biological reality. Niche conservatism should be tested only within appropriate, similar, environmental spaces that are accessible to both species or populations being compared, thus avoiding model extrapolation related to model transfers. Testing for environmental similarity between native and invaded areas is critical to identifying niche shifts during species invasion robustly, but also in applications of ENM to understanding temporal dimensions of niche dynamics.",20.68661161994038,11.58252657708808

Recent studies have implied that HBoV DNA can exist episomally in infected human tissues and therefore can likely establish persistent infection in the host [22] . In our study abdominal pain was recorded in more HBoV-positive patients than HBoV- negative patients with 1 out 14 (7.1%) patients with low viral load, and 3 out 25 (12.0%) with high viral load recording diarrhea (p = 0.5453). Although the mechanisms of pathogenesis and routes of infection of HBoV are not yet understood, some information is available for bovine parvovirus (BPV), another member of the genus Bocavirus that may have implications for HBoV disease. BPV causes respiratory and enteric disease in calves following initial replication in the tonsils and intestinal epithelium, from where it spreads into the blood, lymphoid tissues and respiratory epithelium [23] . Several seroepidemiologic studies have demonstrated that HBoV infects 40-50% of healthy children aged 6 months to 4 years, after which there appears to be widespread immunity. The present study chose 29 outpatients who presented to hospital for respiratory symptoms and 195 healthy controls retrieved from SCDC Sample Bank to analyze the HBoV positive rate and the viral load. Outpatients and inpatients had high viral load (.1610 6 copies/mL) whereas the viral load of healthy controls was low.

In contrast, in chronic viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, contraction slows down such that the viral load approaches a steady state, called the virological set point [3, 4] . In both infection types, the expansion and contraction of the viral load have been modeled as single exponential functions, with parameters determined by linear regression of the log transformed data [3, [5] [6] [7] . This simple approach is reasonable as long as the conditions, e.g., the availability of target cells or the immune response, hardly change within each phase. Using this approach, the initial growth rate, death rate of the infected cells, and the basic reproduction number (i.e., R 0 ) have been estimated, which has improved our understanding of particular virus infections, and has guided medical treatment [7] [8] [9] .

This is consistent with the finding that these challenge groups had the fewest DE genes (Table 2 ) since the strategy for gene sampling primarily selected genes with large expression variances which tended to be drawn from the challenge groups with the largest number of DE genes (Table 3) . Of the 200 genes, 25 were DE in all challenge groups ( Table 3) , indicating that these genes are predictive of infection regardless of specific etiology.

Prolonged persistence of HCoV-NL63 at low levels is another explanation. The HCoV-NL63 load was found to vary with respect to the time of sampling relative to the time of disease onset, with the higher viral loads in early samples (day 1 or 2 after disease onset). This most likely reflects viral clearance by the immune system. This timing effect may also relate to the differences in HCoV-NL63 load in single versus double infections.

Both studies identified multiple SNPs that met a suggestive (20%) genomewide threshold. For antibody at 10 dpi, one QTL was identified in each treatment group (NDV: chr 21, heat + NDV: chr 1). For viral load at 2 dpi, one QTL on chromosome 1 was identified in the heat + NDV group (none in the NDV group). For viral load at 6 dpi, one QTL was identified in each treatment group, on chromosome 4 in the NDV group and on chromosome 24 in the heat + NDV group. No overlap in the location of significance (SNPs or haplotypes) was seen between the GWAS and the results of the targeted genotyping that are presented here. Quite possibly, more variation linked to causative variants was captured in the targeted candidate gene genotyping than was captured in the 600k data, likely due to the much closer distance between SNPs that was used for the candidate gene analysis. Many more tests were performed in the GWAS than the candidate gene analysis that is presented here. Therefore, multiple test corrections would have been more stringent for the GWAS, creating the possibility that any potential shared effects (between GWAS and targeted genotyping) were considered non-significant in the GWAS results due to correction. The results of the two GWAS, combined with the results of the targeted genotyping analysis reported here, will enhance our understanding, providing a holistic view of response to infection under thermoneutral and heat stressed conditions.",18.393875721223555,9.52228007425327

These differences could be the consequence of different methods used in the two studies. While Jenner and Young used the magnitude of gene expression profiles among experiments as a key factor for clustering the genes with subsequent annotation using biological ontologies, we used a robust methodology based on an optimization algorithm that minimizes the numbers of false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, in this study we included noninfectious perturbations, which might hinder the identification of infectious specific response. Another very plausible explanation to those differences is that the general signature highlighted during the pig global immune response might be due to the sampling process. Therefore, the sampling process might induce a stress response independent of whatever previous perturbation is under investigation.

The purpose of sampling was to document the presence of PEDV in feed and to determine whether a change in viral load occurred over time. Samples were collected from the material hopper from the feeder in each room. As these hoppers were rectangular in shape (91.44 cm deep × 61 cm long × 30.5 cm wide), protocols used to sample feed from flatbottom trucks were referenced per the USDA Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration [12] . For collecting feed samples, a model of a grain probe was constructed [12] . This model consisted of 2 PVC tubes (Heritage Plastics Inc., Carrolton, OH, USA), one placed inside the other per standard probe design. The outer tube was 64 cm in length with a diameter of 4.45 cm and the inner tube was 73 cm in length with a diameter of 3.18 cm. To facilitate feed entry into the lumen of the probe, seven 1.91 cm slots were drilled into each tube. Rotation of the outer tube aligned the slots across both tubes, resulting in the entry of feed into the probe via gravity flow. Once sampling was complete, the outer tube was rotated in the opposite direction, thereby closing the slots. To maintain feed in the probe lumen during sampling, as well as facilitate sample removal post-collection, both ends of the model were covered by a 3.18 cm plastic cap.

These encounters can lead to multiple outcomes from symbiotic homeostasis to mutual annihilation, undergo multiple cycles of latency and lysogeny, and lead to coevolution of the interacting genomes. Such systems pose numerous challenges but also some advantages to modeling, especially in terms of functional, mathematical genome representations. The main challenges for the modeling process start with the conceptual definition of a genome for instance in the case of hostintegrated viral genomes. Furthermore, hardly understood influences of the activity of either genome on the other(s) via direct and indirect mechanisms amplify the needs for a coherent description of genome activity. Finally, genetic and local environmental heterogeneities in both the host's cellular and the pathogen populations need to be considered in multiscale modeling efforts. We will review here two prominent examples of host-pathogen interactions at the genome level, discuss the current modeling efforts and their shortcomings, and explore novel ideas of representing active genomes which promise being particularly adapted to dealing with the modeling challenges posed by host-pathogen interactions.",21.986330847063538,12.001727234365152

Having these signals integrated through mTORC1 allows the virus to change its lifecycle in response to fundamental indicators of cell homeostasis including neurotrophic factor support, energy levels, amino acid sufficiency, and oxygen levels in a neuron cell-autonomous manner. While it clearly involves changes to ongoing host mRNA translation, it differs from the global inhibition in response to Pseudomonas exotoxin as discussed above and highlights the more subtle changes resulting from altering the population of mRNAs that are translated in a cap-dependent manner on polyribosomes.

This is achieved by using a level of mathematical abstraction that needs a minimum of biological information to capture all physiologically relevant features of a cellular network. For example, ideally, for in silico modeling of a molecular network, knowledge of the network structure, all reaction rates, concentrations, and spatial distributions of molecules at any time point is needed. Unfortunately, such information is unavailable even for the best-studied systems. In silico simulations thus always have to use a level of mathematical abstraction, which is dictated by the extent of our biological knowledge, by molecular details of the network, and by the specific questions that are addressed. Understanding the complexity of the disease and its biological significance in health can be achieved by integrating data from the different functional genomics experiments with medical, physiological, and environmental factor information, and computing mathematically. The advantage of mathematical modeling of disease lies in the fact that such models not only shed light on how a complex process works, which could be very difficult for inferring an understanding of each component of this process, but also predict what may follow as time evolves or as the characteristics of particular system components are modified.

The viral titer increases with increasing regeneration rates; the more rapidly cells are being regenerated, the larger the sustained viral load. This dependence is stronger for IAV than for RSV, suggesting that as cells become available more rapidly, IAV infects the cells more effectively. We also investigate the variation in peak load of infected cells by varying regeneration rate, r ( Fig. 4 , bottom) . While singly infected infectious cells slightly increase with increasing regeneration for both viruses, the superinfected infectious population increases much more rapidly. This is further evidence that the chronic coinfection is maintained by the superinfected cell population rather than singly infected cells. ",24.60048852745911,13.414525413855683

In Fig. 8 , we examine how changes in superinfection parameters af-fect the peak viral loads of IAV and RSV in coinfection. We see that the production rates of superinfected cells influence peak viral load more than other superinfection parameters. Peak viral load for IAV and RSV are not, respectively, more than 10 7.2 and 10 3.6 PFU/mL even if the average transition time of superinfected eclipse cells to infectious cells and the death rate are short ( ∼ 2.4 hours) along with the slowest death rate of infectious cells. Similarly, a large variation in superinfection rates of IAV and RSV does not produce peak viral load higher than production rates from superinfected cells. Conversely, the peak viral loads can be as high as 10 9 PFU/mL due to superinfection if virus production rates are as high as 10 10 PFU/mL d −1 . Although IAV produces almost similar peak viral load to RSV for a wider range of production rates ( 1 − 10 10 PFU/mL d −1 ), RSV only reaches higher peak viral load when both of them produce more than 10 8 PFU/mL d −1 . Thus, if superinfection production rates are higher than production rates in singly infected cells, the peak loads of each virus can be increased. This is not a likely scenario, however, since viruses are competing for intracellular resources ( Fayyadh et al., 2017; Shinjoh et al., 20 0 0 ), so it is more likely that superinfected cells will produce less of a particular virus than singly infected cells.

Early studies found that patients who have higher viral loads progressed more rapidly to AIDS and death than those with low viral loads. [4] [5] [6] Viral load testing is now widely accepted as a marker of response to ART. The guidelines for initiation of therapy based on viral load have changed as our understanding of disease progression at higher CD4 cell counts has improved. With the availability of newer more potent and less toxic drugs, ART is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals regardless of their CD4 cell count or viral load (DHHS Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines, http://AIDSinfo.nih.gov). After treatment is initiated, viral load testing is crucial for monitoring response to therapy and should be measured in all HIV-infected individuals at the time of entry into care when therapy is initiated and at a regular interval (usually 3e4 months) while on therapy. The standard of care is to treat with a combination of antiretroviral drugs, which are classified based on their viral targets: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors, integrase inhibitors (also known as integrase strand transfer inhibitors [INSTIs] ), and CCR5 entry inhibitors. Current Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines (http://aidsinfo.nih. gov/guidelines) recommend an initial regimen of two NRTIs and an NNRTI, a PI, or an INSTI. The pretreatment viral load values influence the treatment regimen because some regimens are less effective in patients with high viral loads. After initiation of appropriate therapy, there is typically a 2 log 10 or greater decrease in viral load within 2 to 3 months. The goal for a patient is to achieve a viral load below the limit of detection of the most sensitive assays (20e50 copies/mL). Data have shown that the lower the absolute viral load, the better the clinical and virologic outcomes. 7, 8 Guidelines recommend quantifying plasma HIV-1 RNA immediately before initiating therapy and 2 to 8 weeks later, with the goal to achieve an undetectable viral load level within 16 to 24 weeks of initiating therapy. It is important to determine early in the treatment course if there is suboptimal viral load suppression, so that factors affecting adherence can be assessed and, if needed, the regimen altered. After the initial response has been characterized, the viral load should be monitored every 3 to 4 months to ensure the response to therapy is sustained.",28.418611286666586,16.03696490477056

This is likely due to the patients in our sample having a lower viral load than the patients in the other studies, a factor that-as demonstrated here-reduces the sensitivity of the POCT. Three main factors might have influenced the lower viral load in most of our samples and thus the lower sensitivity. Firstly, our study population consisted mainly of adults, while other studies of this POCT were mainly conducted in children. Children often have higher viral loads which can explain better results in antigen detection tests (20) . Secondly, while the previous studies were done in patients who were hospitalized or presented at an outpatient department, here we evaluated the POCT in primary care where patients tend to have less severe illness than those in hospital. Some studies suggest that disease severity correlates positively with viral load (21) . Thirdly, many patients in our study visited the GP almost a week after symptoms had started (data not shown).

Monitoring HCV viral load in untreated patients is not warranted and should be discouraged. Until recently, the standard therapy for patients with chronic HCV infection was pegylated IFN-a in combination with ribavirin administered for either 48 weeks for HCV genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6 infections or for 24 weeks for HCV genotype 2 and 3 infections. Sustained virologic response (SVR) rates were attained in 40% to 50% of patients with genotype 1 and in 80% or more of those with genotype 2 and 3 infections.

Viral load testing also aids in the diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection (the window period after infection that occurs before detectable antibody production), although the currently available viral load assays are not FDA approved for diagnostic purposes. During this period of early infection, patients typically have very high viral loads ranging from 10 5 to 10 7 copies/mL. 10 HIV RNA testing is recommended in the 2014 updated HIV diagnostic testing algorithm for patients who are reactive in a fourth-generation immunoassay but test negative in a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation test, primarily to better detect acute HIV-1 infections. 11 However, only one HIV RNA test is FDA approved for diagnosis, the APTIMA HIV-1 qualitative assay (Hologic, San Diego, CA), and it is not widely available in clinical laboratories.

About 12 h after the first detection of RSV or on the morning of day 6, whichever occurred first, subjects were randomised and received the first dose of ALS-8176 or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was the area under the curve (AUC) for viral load in nasal washes, as determined by a RT-PCR assay for RSV RNA. There appeared to be an advantage when a loading dose was used, the reductions in AUC for viral loads being 73.4%, 85.3% and 88.0% vs. placebo, respectively (Fig. 16) . A secondary end point was the clearance rate of RSV RNA (the slope of the viral load change). It was most rapid in the two regimens with a loading dose, with reductions even at the first post-dosing sample at 12 h. In contrast, the viral load in the placebo group peaked about 3.5 days after randomisation. Importantly, this peak in RSV viral load was associated with a peak of symptoms. In the three treated groups, the mean symptom score and the mucus weights remained at about baseline throughout the observation period. This proof-ofconcept study suggested that ALS-8176 was not only efficacious but that it appeared to be more active than a RSV-fusion inhibitor tested in a previous study of similar design. ALS-8176 is currently being evaluated in young children. It is hoped that the results may be available by the end of the year (2016).",18.983776073438534,9.193565481179867

At day 13, the viral load was only log 10 2.2 less than baseline. Nucleotide analogues have two advantages over other classes of inhibitors. There is a high genetic barrier to resistance selection, due to the HCV RNA polymerase being highly specific for its natural substrates and template.

The main factors limiting a wide utilization of these techniques are cost and the difficulty to absorb the workload in large facilities with numerous samples to analyze per day. Another drawback is that latent viruses or traces of genetic material may be detected. The interpretation of a positive result might be difficult, and it must be carefully correlated to the clinical history of the patient as the presence of a virus in the respiratory tract is a factor exposing to bacterial superinfection (Vareille et al., 2011) . It is possible to quantify the viral load in a respiratory sample, but there are conflicting reports regarding correlations between viral load and outcome (Granados et al., 2017; Wishaupt et al., 2017) . Technical improvements should be made to prevent variation in quantification caused by sample dilution with saline instilled during aspirates or by the variable quantity of sampled material with swabs. These improvements could render comparisons between studies more reliable and permit the establishment of a threshold, above which detected viruses are indeed involved in an ongoing infectious process. In addition, a positive antigen detection test usually correlates with a high viral load in a sample, and a positive cell culture can only be achieved with infective viral particles. Whatever technique is used, fully understanding the benefits and limitations of each is crucial for interpretation. The choice of technique should depend, besides financial considerations, on the necessary sensitivity and speed based on symptoms, comorbidity and risk of a detrimental outcome for each patient. A tertiary care hospital should be able to offer diagnostic tools suitable for each individual case; if testing all patients with molecular techniques is not possible, the use of nonmolecular techniques is preferable over nothing at all.",22.02992647258221,13.347544182128932

We inferred the viral load within a cell from the amount of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that are aligned with viral segments. Specifically, the viral load was defined as the proportion of viral UMIs (that is, UMIs aligned with one of the viral segments) in the total UMI content of a given cell. Accordingly, we defined three groups of cells: (1) ''infected cells,'' cells whose viral load is higher than a certain selected viral-load cutoff; (2) ''bystanders,'' cells that are derived from the influenzatreated mouse but do not detectably express any vmRNA (viral load is zero); and (3) ''unexposed cells,'' cells derived from a control mouse that was never infected ( Figure 1A ). Utilizing a model that takes cross-contamination and various technical artifacts into account, we showed that infected cells can be recovered with high precision over a range of viral-load cutoffs (Supplemental Information and Figures S2A-S2C ). For example, among the inferred infected granulocytes we correctly predicted 99% by using a strict viral-load cutoff of 1%, and 88% by using a more permissive (0.01%) cutoff. Utilizing a reporter model of in vitro infection (Shnayder et al., 2018) , we were able to assess how .

Since NAATs detect both viable and nonviable virus, monitoring patients for treatment response with qualitative testing provides little information as tests may remain positive for days even with successful therapy. Quantitative tests that demonstrate a decline in viral load during therapy more accurately assess patient response (Fig. 52.3a ) and the failure to see a decline ( Fig. 52.3b ) would potentially indicate earlier a need to consider alternative therapies. This information is especially important for critically ill patients and immunosuppressed patients.

In order to take into account variability across the host population, the parameters r i , γ i , λ i , μ i and i are randomly distributed. All these parameters are nonnegative but in accordance with the most natural choice are given normal distributions (central limit theorem, Tuckwell, 1995) with means and standard deviations such that negative values have practically zero chance to occur-and in fact never did occur in any of the trials we have performed. The standard values of the means and standard deviations of these five parameters are shown in Table 1 , their units being as follows: λ i , effectors days −1 ; μ i , days −1 ; r i , days −1 ; γ i , effectors −1 days −1 ; and i , virions −1 days −1 . These values are based in part on (Anderson and May, 1991 ) and on our previous work (Tuckwell et al., , 2001 and are such that when they assume their mean values, the solutions of (5) and (6) in response to an initial small increase in viral load, are such that the viral load rises to a maximum after a few days and then declines to negligible values after about 10 days, while the effector level rises and remains at a higher level (immune memory); that is there are no oscillations. The actual magnitudes of the maximum viral loads are known in some cases where this is the form of the viral population growth curve, e.g. influenza in man (Bocharov and Romanyukha, 1994) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in mice (Bocharov, 1998) . In these references very complicated models (10 to over 40 differential equations) for viral and immune system dynamics have been given but we have employed a reduced system which captures the essence of the very large systems. The key variables (viral load and effector numbers) can be easily rescaled if required to actual biological values (Bocharov, 1998; Bocharov and Romanyukha, 1994; Neumann et al., 1998; Sidorenko, 2005) . For example, viral densities in influenza are of order 10 8 virus particles per millilitre of infected tissue (Sidorenko, 2005) and in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in mice, between 10 7 and 10 9 per millilitre (Bocharov, 1998) . In Fig.  2 is shown an example of the randomly distributed Table 1 . In the top part is shown the distribution for the P 1 's for each individual in the population and in the bottom part that for the P 2 's. Note that some of the latter are at unphysical values as they have negative values of the viral load -see Tuckwell and Wan (2000) for a detailed discussion -but this has no effect as the dynamical variables are constrained to have nonnegative values.

Another advantage is that the resulting data are flowweighted average concentrations making it easy to compute accurate virus loading rates. Studies on pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria in rivers have typically relied on grab samples from which the resulting measured concentrations are multiplied by river discharge to calculate an instantaneous loading rate. Load can be better approximated from a load-duration curve derived from nearly continuous monitoring of discharge at a gauging station and more frequent grab samples (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2001). For viruses, though, it is not practical to collect a sufficient number of grab samples for this approach; time constraints and cost of multiple samples per event are too limiting. If a sufficient number of grab samples are not collected, inaccuracies in load calculation are introduced by failing to account for streamflow-dependent changes in pathogen concentrations, that can vary substantially during an event hydrograph from rising limb to peak streamflow and recession (Krometis et al., 2007) . The flowweighted virus samplers avoided this problem. The primary disadvantage of this approach was that water quality data were collected at only three site locations; the samplers cannot be easily moved to alternative sampling locations. Resulting data represents all upstream processes influencing levels of viruses and other analytes, but without additional samplers, the variability in inputs and losses along discrete sections of the watershed length cannot be ascertained.",21.529894434747014,11.181651645072222

Twenty-four more recent submissions of N gene sequences from Cambodia showed perfect matches to these primers and probes. This indicates that these primers and probes theoretically could detect all currently known circulating strains of RSV. The 100% detection rate for 9.0 × 10 2 copies/mL for RSV A and for 6.0 × 10 3 copies/mL for RSV B are in the same range as previously published methods that used dilution series of plasmid DNA and, when re-calculated and assuming a 1:1 RT efficiency, as methods that used RNA transcripts (ranging from 10 3 to 10 6 copies/mL) (Borg et al., 2003; Gueudin et al., 2003; Kuypers et al., 2004) .

The exhaustion of antiviral CTL responses is modelled as a stepwise process observed in an overwhelming infection with LCMV-Docile. Following the initial activation, LCMV-specific T cells become anergic for 3-5 days and then disappear because of activation-induced cell death (apoptosis). (Of note, the observed lack of T-cell functionality was in time of the described experiments termed anergy; however, this functional state of T cells has been studied in more detail and shown to be a non-responsive state after continuous antigen exposure that is now termed exhausted; for a detailed discussion, see Wherry and Kurachi [26] ). The single characteristic that appeared to be sufficient to control conventional versus exhaustive responses of CTLs was the cumulative viral load (cvl) since the beginning of the infection. The increase of cvl above a certain threshold value in conjunction with the high viral load in the host for about 5 days results in the shift of the infection phenotype from an acute with recovery to a chronic infection.

First, the high viral load during the early phase of illness suggests that patients could be most infectious during this period, and it might account for the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the high viral load on presentation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could be susceptible to emergence of antiviral resistance. Second, age was associated with viral load in this study, which could explain the high degree of severe disease in older patients with SARS-CoV-2. 5, 6 The high viral load in elderly patients is associated not only with low immunity but also with high expression of the ACE2 receptor (the cellentry receptor for SARS-CoV-2) in older adults. 7 The timing of antibody seroconversion is crucial for determining the optimum timepoints for collecting serum specimens for antibody testing for diagnosis. Furthermore, this information is important for immunologists to choose the best timepoints for obtaining peripheral blood B cells for development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. 8 The major strength of the study by To and colleagues is the systematic analysis of the serial viral load and antibody profile for up to 4 weeks, which provides insights into viral and host interactions during the acute and convalescent phases. Another notable aspect is that self-collected posterior oro pharyngeal saliva samples were used, instead of nasopharyngeal specimens, for viral load monitoring. Collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is an invasive procedure, and it is uncomfortable for the patient and poses an infection risk to health-care workers. Self-collected saliva is much more acceptable to patients and is safer for health-care workers. This study clearly shows the feasibility of using saliva for viral load monitoring.",23.535058129814594,14.082520916209186

Similarly, Smit et al. [18] found that infants with a cycle threshold value (Ct) < 35 were more likely to have respiratory symptoms than those with a Ct value > 35.

These data suggest either repeated infections or tendency for prolonged presence / persistence for some respiratory viruses but not all. Therefore, PCR data from previous and recent samples, when available, can be helpful. Detection of single virus as opposed to multiple in symptomatic children also suggests the importance of the finding. Quantitative PCR (viral load) has been use as a way to help indicate the significance of the detected viruses and there have been suggestions to use viral load cut off values to separate virus cause from persistence (27, 41) , but the issue is still controversial. While many studies reported overall positive correlation between viral load and symptom severity (21, (42) (43) (44) , others did not find significant relationship between the quantity of specific viruses and selected clinical outcomes (45) .

Detection of specific nucleic acid from the CSF is dependent on the timing of the CSF sample. In HSE, the sensitivity is 96% and the specificity 99% when CSF is studied between 48 hours and 10 days from symptom onset. Thus, in the early hours often the first CSF analysis can be negative for HSV-1 and should be repeated if clinically suspected (Adler et al., 2011; Steiner, 2012; Kennedy and Steiner, 2013) . A high viral load has been suggested in some, but not all studies, to be correlated with a worse outcome (Nahmias et al., 1982) . On the other hand, no relationship between CSF viral load and severity of clinical symptoms or outcome was detected in 23 HSE patients (Revello et al., 1997) . A long duration of genome detectability (>20 days) is probably more important in predicting poor outcome than initial level (Schloss et al., 2009) . Information on correlation between viral load and outcome is scarce in other encephalitides.

NPA, nasopharyngeal aspirate; NS/TS, nasal and throat swabs. progressively increased from onset of the illness until approximately day 11 after onset. Since the first-generation RT-PCR test has relatively low sensitivity, these results reflect the increasing viral load at different clinical sites during the illness. Whereas these data are cross-sectional, in a previous study viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates was followed up longitudinally in nasopharyngeal specimens collected at days 5, 10, and 15 after illness onset; results of this study also indicated that viral load peaks at day 10 of illness (4) . Such a profile of a progressive increase in viral load is unusual for respiratory viral infections. Most other infections (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza) have peak viral titers in the respiratory secretions at or soon after the onset of clinical illness, after which viral titers and laboratory diagnostic yield decrease progressively (14) . This ""crescendo"" pattern in SARS-CoV detection rates and viral load in clinical specimens has a number of implications. The pattern explains the poor sensitivity of the first-generation diagnostic tests during the first 5 days of the illness and emphasizes the challenge in making laboratory diagnosis early in the disease. These results may also suggest a fundamental difference in the efficacy of the innate immune response in controlling SARS-CoV infection, in contrast, for example, with influenza infection. Innate immune mechanisms are the earliest host defenses that control viral replication and, in the case of many respiratory viruses, do so within the first few days of illness, even before the specific adaptive immune responses have been activated. This response does not appear to occur with SARS, and viral load in the respiratory tract (4) begins to fall only when the antibody response appears, i.e., at approximately day 10 after onset of illness (4, 5) . This finding may suggest that SARS-CoV is able to evade the host innate response and requires the adaptive immune response to bring the infection under control. Finally, the peak viral load in the 2nd week of illness would predict that virus is more likely to be transmitted later in the course of the illness. This result indeed accords with epidemiologic observations (15) . With regard to observations of viral load, the frequent use of steroid therapy in hospitals (16) is a confounding factor that may contribute to the increase in virus load later in the illness.",20.94571226477467,9.716775270044257

We found that the increased disease severity and mortality in Ccr2 −/− mice was associated with a reduction in the number of infiltrated macrophages and that this did not correlate with the observed viral load in the brain. An associated impairment in macrophage migration into the brain from the bloodstream in Ccr2 −/− mice supports the notion that migration of macrophages into an infected brain is dependent on CCR2. It is possible that infiltrated macrophages in the brain may contribute to an antiviral effect by producing inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. This has previously been shown to increase disease severity and mortality in JEV and TBEV infections, using a Tnfa −/− mouse model, without influencing the viral load in the brain [41, 42] . In addition, it is also possible that other CCR2-expressing cells, such as CD8 + T lymphocytes, that we showed to have infiltrated the brains of ROCV-infected WT mice may play an active role in antiviral activity during ROCV infection. Together, this may explain the protective role of infiltrated macrophages in combination with other immune cells, such as T lymphocytes, against ROCV in the CNS without directly influencing the viral load.",19.057078978539757,8.569594050836999

More importantly, hMPV was detected in 10.6% of specimens for which no other viral pathogen was detected by FA. This is the first report of quantification of hMPV in pediatric respiratory specimens, although interpretation of these results must take into account the variability between patients in collection of respiratory specimens. In our collection and testing methods, both inter and extra-cellular viral RNA were detected by the assay so that the specimen volume, more than the number of cells in a sample, determined the viral load. Volumes were recorded for each specimen and varied across the study by a factor of four. While the viral load comparisons in this paper are based on respiratory specimens that do vary in volume and inferences should be made with caution, a 10-fold difference in hMPV copies/mL between specimens is most likely a real difference. The mean number of hMPV in these specimens (7.67 log 10 copies/mL) was similar to the mean number of RSV (7.30 log 10 copies/mL) detected in pediatric respiratory specimens (Kuypers et al., 2004) . For RSV infections, the virus load was significantly higher for patients in the lowest (0-6 months) age group compared to older RSV positive children (Kuypers et al., 2004) , while for hMPV, children 7-12 months old had significantly higher levels of hMPV than did younger children.

Although our infant had no respiratory symptoms, the nearby environment could have been contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 through crying or drooling. There was a downward trend of viral load with increasing distance from the infant (from bedding to cot rail). However, the Ct values at the table 1 meter away from the cot indicated higher viral load. For droplet transmission, one would expect the viral load in the environment to fall with increasing distance from the immobile infant. However, baby formula and other items, such as baby wipes, were placed on it. Therefore, it seems more likely that the contamination was due to indirect contact via HCW hands between baby and table. These findings suggests that even generally well infants positive for SARS-COV-2 with no respiratory symptoms can easily contaminate nearby environments. Our data also reaffirm the importance of hand hygiene when caring for infants with COVID-19 and potentially in helping to reduce environmental virus contamination. ",27.511688375728,12.75265184888227

These two limits are assessed differently and are not equivalent in either definition or, in some cases, their assigned values. The LOD (also referred to as analytical sensitivity) represents the lowest viral load level at which !95% of tested samples are detected (CLSI EP17-A, 2004); theoretically, viral levels at or below the LOD are not detected !5% of the time. It differentiates between 'detectable' and 'undetectable' results. The LLOQ, on the other hand, is the lowest viral level that is within the linear and analytically acceptable range of the assay (CLSI EP17-A, 2004) . In other words, the LLOQ is the lowest point at which an accurate viral load can be assigned and determines which 'detectable' sample will have a reported viral load. A common misconception is that the LOD of the assay is the minimum viral level for a 'detected' result but 'undetectable' and 'detectable' viral levels are never differentiated by a single theoretical viral threshold as viral levels less than the LOD may still have a high probability of being detected. This probability spans a broad range in which the lower the viral titre, the more likely the 'undetectable' result. Ultimately, the statistical probability will favour the 'undetectable' result ( Figure 3 ). And because the LLOQ can be equal or greater than the LOD on some viral load assays, it is not unusual for 'detectable but below the LOQ' (detectable/BLOQ) result reporting (Cobb et al., 2011) . Further, the 'detectable/BLOQ' results should not be inferred that the actual viral concentration of the sample is between the LOD and LOQ.",20.419489547301566,9.702516219656896

This can be undertaken by spiking the sampler with a known concentration of the pathogen and then assessing the concentration collected. 60 However, earlier studies used various other methods, such as using two samplers in tandem or parallel, to assess sampling efficiency. 117 Surrogate viruses may be used to limit the hazard when investigating high-risk pathogens, but it should be borne in mind that each pathogen responds uniquely to the conditions experienced. 118 The time-interval during which the sampler will operate should also be replicated during laboratory testing in order to identify any operational issues or time-related loss of bioefficiency. During such bioefficiency tests, inherent variations in performance of the sampler may also become evident over different particle size ranges. 119 With the limitations of different sampling devices being widely acknowledged and variation in collection efficiency between such devices being noted, establishing the bioefficiency of your chosen sampler against the target microbe in itself provides a valuable contribution to the field of bioaerosol sampling. 11, 53 If the target microbe is unknown and a general assessment of bioaerosol particles present in an environment is sought, then the use of different types of sampling devices will mitigate the limitations of individual samplers, making a comprehensive study more likely.",21.226226077759783,10.861959238051952

The authors also concluded later 97 that the trigger for this could be ABV but also any other viral infection. However, this needs to be questioned, as it was not possible to find antiganglioside antibodies in confirmed PDD cases after experimental ABV infection and a very poor connection between ABV positivity and occurrence of antiganglioside antibodies in clinical cases has been shown. 97 A more detailed view of potential immunemediated pathogenesis of ABV is provided in Chapter 11. It should also be kept in mind that the role of viral factors in the pathogenesis is not yet determined. It is known that different ABV strains act differently within the same host by terms of viral replication and pathogenicity. The first trial comparing the experimental infection of cockatiels with two different ABV genotypes under identical conditions, demonstrated that one strain (ABV-2) was more pathogenic to cockatiels than the other strain (ABV-4) and that viral RNA shedding occurred significantly earlier in ABV-4-infected birds compared with ABV-2-infected birds but that seroconversion occurred significantly earlier in the ABV-2 group. 98 More interestingly, the viral load of ABV-RNA in the different organs was significantly higher in the ABV-4-infected group despite the presence of fewer clinical signs. Additionally, in ABV-4-infected birds the tissue virus load findings were comparable in all birds, independently from the time point of death after infection or the route of inoculation (intracerebral versus intravenous). In the ABV-2-infected birds, the viral load in the different organs after infection depended on the route of infection (intracerebral-infected birds higher compared with intravenous-infected birds) and the time point of death after infection (early death birds had a lower load compared with late death birds). Last but not least, ABV-4 antigen was more often detected in the CNS of infected birds compared with that of birds infected with ABV-2, where antigen was found to be increased in the GI tract. 98 Most interestingly, reisolation was easily possible from ABV-4-infected birds from nearly all tissues within a couple of days, whereas re-isolation of ABV-2 depended on the time point of death or the identifiable disease of the host. Reisolation of virus from the birds that died earlier after experimental infection was successful only after several passages in cell culture compared with what was seen in infected birds that died later, where reisolation was typically possible in the first passage. These results indicated additionally that the amount of virus (and viral replication) is not correlated with the severity and speed of the disease and its progress. In addition, it is apparent that the virus induces the disease through mechanisms (e.g., earlier activation of the immune system) independently of the viral load or even that earlier activation of the immune system causes more severe disease but does not allow the virus to replicate quickly. This seems to be supported by the fact that viral shedding was also noted significantly later compared with the ABV-4 group with a far higher viral replication and less severe symptoms. The infection patterns of ABV-2 demonstrates many parallels to BDV infection in mammals, as it is known that minimal viral replications can trigger the onset of clinical symptoms and that disease progression depends on host immune response. 99 It needs to be considered, as clearly stated by Lierz et al, 98 that the differences found between ABV-2 and ABV-4 must not only be related to the different genotype, but they could also present strain specific variations and can theoretically also occur in different variants within a genotype. Additionally, the ABV-4 isolate used originated from a macaw compared with the ABV-2 isolate originating from a cockatiel and might therefore be differently adapted to the trial animals (cockatiels). However, they demonstrated varying viral factors influencing the viral kinetics and host-virus interactions. Further studies should focus on the interaction of ABV with the host to better understand the viral and host factors involved in triggering clinical disease after infection.",15.801240242057638,8.567827195710697

The use of saliva is preferred over nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens for serial viral load monitoring because this would reduce the discomfort to the patient and reduce the health hazards to healthcare workers during repeated sampling. Our experience with SARS in 2003 showed that viral load often peaked at day 10 after symptom onset. Thus, early detection and isolation of cases was strategic for infection control and provides the window of opportunity for antiviral therapy to decrease the peak viral load. The positive viral culture indicates that saliva contains live viruses that may allow transmission. Respiratory viruses are considered to be transmitted from person to person through direct or indirect contact, or via coarse or fine droplets. Saliva can be emitted through cough, and respiratory droplets containing influenza virus can be found even during normal breathing [11] . Therefore, 2019-nCoV may be transmitted via saliva directly or indirectly even among patients without coughing or other respiratory symptoms. Our findings reinforce the use of surgical masks as a control measure. SARS-CoV has been shown to infect epithelial cells in salivary gland ducts in rhesus macaques [12] . The presence of 2019-nCoV in patients' saliva suggests the possibility of salivary gland infection. However, it should be noted that saliva specimens not only contain saliva secreted from major or minor salivary glands but also contain secretions coming down from the nasopharynx or coming up from the lung via the action of cilia lining the airway.

HIV-1 infection includes a long asymptomatic period in which the viral load (the amount of virus particles in peripheral blood) fluctuates around a value known as the 'set point' (Mellors et al., 1996) . It has been proposed that the set point viral load has been the object of selection to maximize transmission, the result of a trade off between the effect of set point viral load on infectiousness and the duration of the asymptomatic period (Fraser et al., 2007) . If set point viral load is too high, then infected individuals have fewer opportunities to transmit before developing AIDS whereas if it is too low, they are not infectious enough to efficiently transmit the virus. For natural selection to act on set point viral load, it must be a heritable property. That is to say, the set point viral load of the infector and infected must be correlated. If it is not, then there is no heritable variation on which natural selection can work. Subsequent work has produced evidence that set point viral load is indeed heritable, and correlated with viral genotype (Hollingsworth et al., 2010; Alizon et al., 2010) .",27.919662659972328,13.207032494707203

It has been reported that ribavirin cannot inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in vitro [13] . Previously, Peiris et al. [7] examined the viral load pattern in 14 patients who received ribavirin and steroid therapy. Because the viral load was not analyzed with respect to the exact time course of therapy for each patient, the effect of ribavirin on viral load was not addressed. In this study, we examined the effect of ribavirin on viral load in vivo. Despite the small sample size studied, we closely monitored the viral load and ribavirin use in each patient. We report different profiles of viral load during the course of infection and that use of ribavirin does not result in reduction of viral load in ∼40% of the patients studied. Whether ribavirin use is associated with the high mortality among patients with SARS requires further investigation. This is the first study investigating the temporal relationship of viral load, proinflammatory cytokines, and clinical progression. Although there was some variation in the cytokine profiles, our analysis revealed a common picture and indicated that the elevation of IL-6 and/or IL-8 levels subsequent to the peak of viral replication is involved in pulmonary progression ( figure  1) . Similarly, the occurrence of the nadir lymphocyte count and peak LDH level lagged behind the peak viral load and IL-6 level (figure 2). This suggests that an immune-mediated process is involved in lymphopenia and tissue damage in patients with SARS [14] . Of note, the nadir lymphocyte count seems to correlate with the peak viral load ( ), raising the possibility P p .084 of a direct effect of viral replication on lymphopenia. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis of a viral replication phase followed by an immune response phase in the pathogenesis of SARS. Moreover, these findings provide important information on therapeutic strategies for SARS, including antivirals and immune-based regimens, such as steroids, IVIG, and convalescent-phase serum infusions. With regard to convalescent-phase serum infusions, we also examined IgG seroconversion in these 8 patients by an indirect immunofluorescence assay described elsewhere [15] . As shown in figure 1 , seroconversion correlated with the decrease in viral load in most cases. However, a delay in the decrease of viral load was found in patients E and F, and the viral load remained high in patients D and H in the presence of antibody. Although a study preliminarily suggested the efficacy of convalescentphase serum infusions [16] , our observation suggests that development of antibody may not correlate with clearance of virus, which should be taken into consideration before using convalescent-phase serum infusions as a therapeutic strategy.",26.27608587843693,12.122297212241897

Scraping of the bottom of the vesicle, where most virus-infected cells are present, may result in a very high viral load. Second, the viral load may not fluctuate too much in relation to the time that is needed to generate a quantitative test result. In acute viral infections, the virus load increases quickly to very high levels and decreases after that. For many acute viral respiratory infections it is not possible to show a relation between the viral load and the seriousness of the respiratory disease.

Recommendations for viral load testing became part of standard guidelines for treating HIV infection ( Chesebro and Everett, 1998 ) . The theranostic became tied to the use of the drug. Roche's Amplicor Access Program led to rapid test utilization. As volumes increased, manufacturers developed automation. HIV management requires relatively frequent monitoring, as often as four times per year. Therefore, the test was not a ""one off "" test as in constitutional genetic testing. HIV viral load testing also obtained its own CPT code, facilitating reimbursement. Additionally, the kit manufacturer, the national reference labs, patients, and doctors all worked to ensure that the test was reimbursed. These factors helped make HIV viral load testing cost effective and a foundation of HIV prevention efforts. The combination of viral load testing and new therapeutics transformed HIV from a uniformly fatal disease to a chronic treatable disease. Therefore, HIV has become a disease with an ""actionable "" result. Recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations now call for general population screening for HIV status. This example of translating a diagnostic into patient care was successful because so many of the hallmarks of successful diagnostic tests were in place. There was an unmet clinical need, an actionable result was obtained from testing, the test was ultimately cost effective, high-throughput analysis became available, and reimbursement issues were rapidly resolved.",27.48365891893795,13.314923128704546

In our study, BAL samples that were also positive by conventional methods generally had a higher viral load ( Supplementary Figure 2A) , consistent with previous reports in nasal wash samples [13] . The results also show that the ""proven"" and ""probable"" disease categories do not differ with regard to viral load and that the presence of clinical LRTD symptoms was not associated with higher viral load (Supplementary Figure 2B) .

Pathogen genotyping is also essential in order to identify variants resistant to therapy, and to differentiate closely-related species or viral types. Currently, the gold standard for pathogen detection is growth of the pathogen in culture. This process is time-consuming and in many cases non-informative. Diagnostic methods for viral detection consist primarily of immunological identifi cation of antibodies produced in response to viral infection. Molecular diagnostics utilizing nucleic acid amplifi cation testing (NAAT) have been used for viral load monitoring and genotyping for HIV and screening for HIV1, hepatitis B and C (HBV, HCV), and West Nile virus (WNV) ( Paxton, 2004 ) . In HIV and HCV there is a window between infection and detection of antibody production in which immunological methods fail to detect viral infection. This is a very important issue for blood safety and for the identifi cation of acute infections which may account for a high percentage of new clinical cases. NAAT testing has been implemented for blood screening and has been estimated to prevent about fi ve HIV-1 and 56 HCV infections per year. Another advantage of NAAT testing lies with the fl exibility of the platform in the face of emerging infectious disease threats. When WNV became a public health concern in 2002, these platforms were converted for the detection and monitoring of WNV within 9 months. With the incorporation of DNA microarray technologies, rapid pathogen detection and genotyping may be accomplished simultaneously. Recently, a protein microarray for Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, has been tested and found to distinguish between SARS and other Corona viruses ( Zhu et al., 2006 ) . Low-density microarray tests are being researched for use in subtyping infl uenza A and avian type H5N1. These types of arrays may soon have clinical utility for monitoring infl uenza worldwide, developing vaccines, and eventually for point of care applications ( Mehlmann et al., 2007 ) . This last application is very important, as determining the presence of infl uenza on solely clinical grounds is very diffi cult due to poor specifi city and sensitivity of clinical fi ndings, the other pathogens that cause similar symptoms, and the infl uenza subtypes that cause different symptoms. For example, up to 70% of patients with infl uenza symptoms are not infected with infl uenza virus, and up to 30% of those are due to Coronaviruses (Montalto, 2003 ; Brown, 2006 ) . CombiMatrix has developed a DNA microarray to detect and type infl uenza strains and Tm Bioscience Corp. (now Luminex) has developed a major human respiratory virus array. Molecular diagnostics can be utilized for sexually transmitted diseases such as Chlamydia trachomitis and Nisseria gonorrhea, as well as other bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophilia (Legionnaire's disease), Borrelia burgdoreri (Lyme disease), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis (whooping cough). Despite effective vaccination programs, Bordetella pertussis remains an important and highly contagious disease due to the fact that newborns do not appear to gain passive maternal protection and vaccine-induced immunity is far less complete than expected. A real-time PCR assay that accurately detects and differentiates the DNA from both agents of pertussis syndromes has been developed ( Vincart et al., 2007) . This real-time PCR assay provides results within 24 h of sample receipt and provides clinicians with more timely and accurate information than that provided by culture, direct fl uorescence antibody, serological testing, or even conventional PCR methods. Additional applications include tissue product testing, bioterrorism monitoring, and characterization of host-pathogen interactions in the search for additional diagnostic biomarkers.",17.408009875827332,12.272914590591842

However, by the mid-1990s, pharmaceutical companies had a number of antiviral compounds; some specifi cally tailored to HIV, well into clinical trials and needed an accurate biomarker to analyze effectiveness of the new therapies. This convergence of therapeutics and diagnostics would lead to the birth of the theranostic , a diagnostic test linked to the application of specifi c therapies ( Warner, 2004 ) . In 1996, Roche Diagnostics began the Roche Amplicor® Access Program to provide two free baseline HIV viral load tests to anyone in the United States with HIV ( James, 1996 ) . Reference laboratories helped execute this program, which began the successful uptake of HIV viral load testing in the marketplace. As with traditional diagnostics, molecular diagnostic tests needed to demonstrate utility and performance before their adoption into practice. First, there must be an unmet clinical need, which was clearly the case with HIV. Secondly, with the development of antiviral therapies, HIV viral load testing provided information that resulted in a therapeutic action, and also provided the means to continually monitor the effi cacy of the treatment.

Mathematical modeling the transmission and dynamics of HIV infection can lead to a deeper understanding of the disparate experimental data and identify therapies most likely to be effective in controlling the disease. Dynamically modeling the timedependent HIV prevalence in the Nairobi Sex Worker cohort lead to the prediction, subsequently observed, that the observed resistance or immunity to HIV infection exhibited by some members of the cohort is not absolute but transient. Thus, whatever cellular or other type of immunity that is responsible for this observed resistance to HIV infection is not strong enough to reliably prevent infection. The dynamics of HIV infection below the viral density threshold can only be inferred from a dynamical model extrapolated into this region. A model analysis of viral load growth during the primary HIV infection leads to the conclusion that the viral load doubling time immediately following infection varies between 0.16 and 0.46 days. Analyzing published modeling results on the steady-state HIV infection in chronically infected patients leads to the conclusion that the viral load doubling times immediately following HAART interruption are virtually identical to the above results for primary infection patients. Moreover, the doubling times at threshold for infected patients treated with vaccine and/or IL-2 therapies before and/or after HAART withdrawal are virtually identical to those of untreated cohorts. Thus, neither prolonged familiarity with HIV infection nor vaccine and/or IL-2 therapies significantly increase the strengths of the immune systemTs humoral or interferon responses to HIV infection. An important question to answer is why vaccine and/or IL-2 therapies all fail to measurably strengthen the immune system response to HIV infection. Dynamically modeling the rebound of HIV infection following HAART withdrawal leads to the conclusion that the immune systemTs inability to reduce the viral load to a value below threshold is not due a failure in its phagocytic arm but to the failure of its cellular arm to clear productively infected cells from the host at a rapidly enough rate. This failure is traceable to the existence of a pool of productively infected CD4+ cells (T cells, natural killer cells, etc.) whose half-lives in vivo are uncharacteristically long so that their numbers are easily replaced by newly infected, similarly long-lived, CD4+ cells. One compartment of this pool consists of CD4+ Natural Killer cells that are HIV-1infectable, have higher survival half lives than typically infected CD4+ T cells, and are unaffected by HAART. This pool cannot be cleared by the immune system, primed by vaccines and/or IL-2 or not, and is responsible for the observed, characteristic, saturation in the viral density curve at the viral set-point. Thus, an HIV infected immune system cannot eliminate all sources of viral production on its own-outside antiviral intervention is needed. Expanding HAART to include fusion blockers and overcoming its current deficiencies is the most promising path to take in seeking an effective therapy for HIV infection. Moreover, achieving and using the ideal HAART as a prophylactic would prevent infection in the uninfected.",19.565629055556673,12.430174392123973

To reduce morbidity and improve quality of life for persons living with HIV/AIDS, the WHO is rapidly expanding access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in developing countries accounting for over 67% of HIV-1 infections. 39, 41 However, this expansion is significantly restricted by the lack of cost-effective POC viral load assays that can effectively reach patients living in rural settings. In the developed countries, HIV-1 viral load is regularly used to closely monitor and assess the patient response to ART, to ensure drug adherence, and to stage disease progression. In contrast, in developing countries, CD4 + T lymphocyte count and clinical symptoms are used to guide ART following the WHO guidelines with the exception of infants, where viral load assays are required. 42, 43 Although CD4 testing is a great tool for monitoring patients, 44, 45 recent studies have shown that CD4 + cell counting strategy cannot detect early virological failure. 42, 43 However, HIV-1 viral load assays are expensive ($50-200 per test), instrumentdependent, and technically complex.",24.126146676916676,11.297904551995375

Combined data from nine clinical trials in Africa showed that 35% of HIV-1 positive infants die by the age of 1 and 52% of HIV-1-infected children die by the age of 2, highlighting the importance of viral load monitoring to prevent MTCT in resourceconstrained settings. 47 Studies have shown that long-term suppression of HIV-1 replication in infants can be achieved by initiating ART, to reduce AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, and improve the quality of life. 47, 48 To provide early AIDS care and ART to HIV-infected infants, early diagnosis is key. However, simple and rapid serological assays cannot detect HIV-infected infants until 18 months after birth. 49 The late identification of AIDS children is due to the interference of maternal HIV-1 specific antibodies, which are passively transferred through the placenta and persist in infants for approximately 18 months. 50 Thus, a readily available POC viral load test for early detection of HIV-infected infants is urgently needed in resource-constrained settings.",23.33082616502668,11.125718159090667

In recent years, infectious diseases, especially viral outbreaks such as HIV, have a tremendous global healthcare impact, since such viruses could rapidly evolve, spread and turn into pandemics. For instance, HIV/AIDS has had a devastating global impact causing over 25 million deaths. 1, 2 The identification and control of forthcoming epidemics will be only be possible by developing reliable, accurate, and sensitive diagnostic technologies that have ability to be tailored to multiple settings. Detection of these viruses still poses significant biological and engineering challenges. Biological challenges arise due to the presence of multiple subtypes of viruses that makes it difficult to achieve repeatable and reliable capture efficiency from clinical specimens without demanding lengthy sample preparation steps. For instance, monitoring viral load for HIV at the point-of-care (POC) is still an unaddressed challenge. Traditional detection techniques such as culturing, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cannot be implemented at POC settings without well-equipped laboratories. 3 Cell culture is a time-consuming, costly, and technically demanding method that requires skilled technicians. Adding to this problem, some viruses cannot be cultured. 4 In ELISA-based methods, multiple sampling steps and reagents are required. Although PCR technology offers a versatile powerful detection platform in clinical samples, 5, 6 for common viral subtypes, it requires parallel testing of external standards, complex multi-step manipulations such as labor-intensive sample preparation (plasma separation and RNA extraction), amplification (expensive reagents) and detection. 3 Thus, simple, specific, accurate and reliable viral load assays are necessary to avoid further viral propagation and to initiate treatment.",21.252439556789913,10.677776845689

Because DIPs suppress viral load, they have long been entertained as therapies for viral diseases [46, 47] . A more recent proposal is to engineer DIPs as therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs); any TIP transmission among hosts is a strong potential benefit [48, 49] . Thus, TIPs that protect against HIV would not only suppress the disease but would also spread and automatically target superspreaders [7] . Despite the promise of this approach, challenges await.

Another thing to note is the increased number of Xpert PCR cycles that were required to detect any viral particles for the atomized 100,000 TCID 50 /mL suspension during indirect versus direct sampling, which indicates lower amounts of virus present in the samples collected during indirect sampling. The particle size distributions for direct sampling and indirect sampling are included in the supplementary material (Fig. S2) , showing that smaller particles (< 50 nm) may be scavenged due to diffusion loss.

Quantification of HRV using RT-PCR assays with a consensus HRV primer and probe set may be limited due to the diversity of HRV genotypes; reverse transcriptase digital PCR has shown more accurate quantification [28] . However, the overall performance of RT-PCR appears to be similar to reverse transcriptase digital PCR for most genotypes.

Reliable data for profiles of serial viral load and serum antibody responses are needed urgently to guide antiviral treatment, infection control, epidemiological measures, and vaccination. The peak viral load of patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections occurs at around 7-10 days after symptom onset, which could be associa ted with nosocomial outbreaks involving healthcare workers. 2, 4 Clinical studies of antiviral agents for SARS showed that the viral load decreased significantly with treatment success. 5 No systematic study of these two important variables with statistical analysis has been done for SARS-CoV-2, although preliminary descriptive studies have been reported.

However, collection of nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens can induce coughing and sneezing, which generates aerosol and is a potential health hazard for health-care workers. Collection of throat swabs also requires direct inspection of the patient's posterior pharynx and tonsils. Furthermore, collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is a relatively invasive procedure, which is uncomfortable and can even induce bleeding. A patient's reluctance to provide a sample can account for the paucity of timepoints in viral load studies of respiratory virus infections.

Using nasal swab and throat swab, Zou and colleagues 8 have also reported a high viral load shortly after symptom onset. However, in that study, only cycle threshold values (not exact viral loads) were reported, and no statistical or correlative analysis was done with clinical variables such as age, comorbidities, disease severity, and antibody response. The viral load profile of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of influenza, which peaks at around the time of symptom onset, but contrasts with that of SARS-CoV at around 10 days and that of MERS-CoV at the second week after symptom onset. 4, 16, 17 The high viral load on presentation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily, even when symptoms are relatively mild. This finding could account for the efficient person-to-person transmission noted in community and health-care settings. Clusters in families, workplaces, religious gatherings, and food premises have been widely reported. 18 The viral load profile is important for guiding antiviral treatment. Since viral load had already peaked around the time of hospital admission, the risk of emergence of antiviral resistance could be similar to that of single-drug treatment of influenza by adamantanes, acid polymerase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. However, our previous clinical trial of influenza treatment showed that a triple antiviral combination could significantly improve the clinical outcome and viral load profile and could reduce emergence of resistant virus quasispecies. 19 Currently, no standard treatment is available for Figure 3 : Relation between viral load and age or disease severity Correlation between age and peak viral load (A).

For SARS-CoV infection, our previous treatment study showed that a combination of lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin led to significantly fewer compli cations (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome) or deaths than reported with historical controls treated with ribavirin. 5 Lopinavir-ritonavir or interferon beta 1b also reduced lung damage and decreased viral load in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV. 20 Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor with in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the idea that SARS-CoV 3C-like protease was the antiviral target of lopinavir was based purely on binding in computational modelling. 21 Other protease inhibitors and nucleotide analogues (eg, remdesivir [Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA]) are potential candidates for treatment. Combination treatment with virus-targeting and host-targeting agents to improve clinical outcome should be investigated. Studies for SARS-CoV have shown that a high initial viral load was associated with death. 22 However, our study only showed that the median viral load was 1 log 10 higher in severe cases than in mild cases, and the difference was not significant. But, older age was associated with a higher peak viral load. In a previous study of patients infected with SARS-CoV, older age was an independent factor associated with higher viral load, 23 as expected for immunosenescence, which impairs our innate and adaptive immune responses.",24.476813193099083,12.769214372414085

Early increases in viral load in cell-free supernatant (day 5) indicated active viral replication and release of viral particles. Persistence of viral DNA in cells without detectable viral DNA in supernatant during the later stages of infection suggested the development of latency. This observation is further supported by a lack of viral antigen and viral RNA expression during the persistent phase of infection. RNA for the immediate early genes (U16/U17, U94) and the late gene U12 was undetectable by RT-PCR at days 30, 38, and 47 post infection (data not shown). Yasukawa and coauthors defined latency as presence of HHV-6 viral DNA without expression of viral RNA (Yasukawa et al, 1999a) . Our results suggest that HHV-6A can form a latent infection in MO3.13 and thus provides in vitro support to the hypothesis that HHV-6 may persist in oligodendrocytes in vivo. The immediate-early gene U94 has been suggested to play a role in latency, but in our study we were unable to detect RNA for U94 or for the immediate-early gene U16/U17 and the late gene U12. It is unclear whether immediate-early genes are expressed in cells persistently infected with HHV-6. Expression of immediate early genes is not an inherent feature of latency in the related herpesvirus CMV (Kurz et al, 1999) but may represent the first step of reactivation (Hummel and Abecassis, 2002) . In vivo, establishment of latency and reactivation episodes of recurrent infections are hallmarks of herpesvirus biology. Amongst herpesviruses, only human herpesvirus 1 (HSV-1) and HHV-6 have been demonstrated to establish latent infections in the brain Fraser et al, 1981) . Compared to HHV-6B, HHV-6A is detected three times more frequently in brain tissue (Cuomo et al, 2001) and has been suggested to be more neurotropic in vivo (Rotola et al, 2004) and in vitro (De Bolle et al, 2005) . The ability to actively infect oligodendrocytes and develop latency may account for more frequent detection of HHV-6A in brain tissue.",27.628872209389797,13.163154644528952

Viral loads in cell lysates and cell-free supernatants were quantified by HHV-6A-and HHV-6B-specific real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During the first 2 days of infection with HHV-6A, viral load in both cell lysate and supernatant decreased ( Figure 2A ). By day 3, HHV-6A viral load peaked in HHV-6A-infected cell lysates (1.3 log increase) followed 2 days later by a peak in HHV-6A viral load in supernatants (a 1.2 log increase) ( Figure 2A ). These observations were suggestive of active HHV-6A viral replication in virusinfected MO3.13 cells wheras detection of increased HHV-6A viral loads in supernatants indicated release of viral particles. Following the early increase in viral replication, cell lysate viral load stabilized and remained at a level of 1 copy/10 cells for the duration of infection (62 days). HHV-6A viral loads in supernatant decreased after the initial spike at day 5 and were undetectable after 14 days ( Figure 2A ). The presence of viral DNA in cells without viral DNA in supernatant suggested the development of a latent infection. During latency, there was no active viral DNA replication because the intracellular viral DNA load remained steady and we were unable to detect viral DNA in cell culture supernatant.

At the time of writing, no antiviral is reported to be clinically effective for the treatment of this novel coronavirus. Ribavirin has broad-spectrum antiviral activities and is effective for the treatment of fulminant hepatitis in mice caused by the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. 15 Although the inhibitory activity of ribavirin against mouse hepatitis coronavirus is weak, ribavirin can decrease the release of proinflammatory cytokines from the macrophages of mice. It also switched the immune response of the mice from a Thelper-2 to a T-helper-1 response. Thus, irrespective of its antiviral role, ribavirin may act as an immunomodulator.

PCR Ct values obtained by testing the standardized self-collection specimens described in the present study could potentially be used as a general indicator of viral load changes over time. Future studies should systematically assess the variability of Ct values using this methodology, to confirm that the observed changes in Ct values are greater than those explained by specimen collection and assay variability. Furthermore, it would be of interest to determine whether changes in Ct values reliably are associated with resolution of clinical symptoms.

Random and undirected microbiologic sampling of air is not warranted. It is important that the level of activity and other conditions in the room be constant between and during sampling periods, otherwise counts will have little meaning. High-volume air sampling can be useful in epidemiologic studies. For example, McGarrity and Dion (1978) recovered polyoma virus from the air of a mouse room while cages were being changed. Usually, monitoring of air for its microbial content is done by one of three methods: (1) settling plates (Petri dishes) exposed to the air for a stated period of time, usually 1 h; (2), high-volume air impact samplers, that is, Andersen Cascaded Sieve Sampler (Andersen Samplers, Inc., Smyrna, GA); and (3) liquid impingers. Settle plates are inexpensive and can give a qualitative picture of the organisms (bacteria and fungi) present if they grow on the culture media used. Do not use settle plates to quantify the concentration of airborne fungal spores (Streifel referenced in CDC 2003) . Methods 2 and 3 will also allow for recovery of some viruses, provide quantitative answers and have the advantage of sampiing, a large volume of air; however, the equipment is more expensive and requires more training to use it properly.

However, growth of the bacillus is relatively time-consuming and insensitive, and rapid and reliable tests are needed for early warning systems, for rapid identification of a contaminated environment, and for epidemiological and forensic investigations. Gene amplification systems have been developed that use PCR technology to amplify and characterize specific DNA sequences of Y. pestis, such as Pst, Cafl, YopM, and Pla targets (Henchal et al., 2001; Radnedge et al., 2001; Rahalison et al., 2000) . Most such rapid sequencing approaches use fluorogenic 5Ј nuclease chemistry. PCR assay coupled to probe hydrolysis (e.g., TaqMan R ) allows ""real-time"" detection of PCR products. Rapid thermocycling instruments, such as the Lightcycler TM (Roche Molecular Systems), the Ruggedized Advanced Pathogen Identification Device (RAPID TM , Idaho Technologies), or the SmartCycler TM (Cepheid) allow identification of the agent in 20-40 minutes after nucleic acid purification (Henchal et al., 2001) . In the US, several ""sniffing devices"" to detect aerosolized microbial pathogens have been developed and tested. The Department of Homeland Security and the Environmental Detection Agency have deployed a PCR-based detection system named BioWatch to continuously monitor filtered air in major cities for Y. pestis and other select agents. Other monitoring systems include the Interim Biological Agent Detector System (IBADS TM ) that uses immunoassay to detect particles captured on a flowthrough membrane, and the Biological Integrated Detection System (BIDS TM ) that uses a light addressable potentiometric device as the detector (Henchal et al., 2001) . Such technologies, designed by the US military for the battlefield, have been used experimentally to monitor specific high-profile civilian events and sensitive sites that could be targets of terrorism. In the event of a real or suspected aerosol release by terrorists, immediate environmental sampling could be performed using PCR, hand-held immunochromatographic assay, and cultural isolation techniques to identify the agent used and to determine the extent of contamination. Only cultural isolation determines viability of the agent involved, and allows characterization of important attributes, such as virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility.",22.4305558832027,11.435992763542941

At a temperature of 30 C or more the duration of persistence is shorter. Veterinary coronaviruses have been shown to persist even longer for 28 d. Contamination of frequent touch surfaces in healthcare settings are therefore a potential source of viral transmission. Data on the transmissibility of coronaviruses from contaminated surfaces to hands were not found. However, it could be shown with influenza A virus that a contact of 5 s can transfer 31.6% of the viral load to the hands [9] . The transfer efficiency was lower (1.5%) with parainfluenza virus 3 and a 5 s contact between the surface and the hands [10] . In an observational study, it was described that students touch their face with their own hands on average 23 times per h, with contact mostly to the skin (56%), followed by mouth (36%), nose (31%) and eyes (31%) [11] . Although the viral load of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces is not known during an outbreak situation it seem plausible to reduce the viral load on surfaces by disinfection, especially of frequently touched surfaces in the immediate patient surrounding where the highest viral load can be expected. The WHO recommends ""to ensure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly. Thoroughly cleaning environmental surfaces with water and detergent and applying commonly used hospital-level disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite) are effective and sufficient procedures."" [12] The typical use of bleach is at a dilution of 1:100 of 5% sodium hypochlorite resulting in a final concentration of 0.05% [13] . Our summarized data with coronaviruses suggest that a concentration of 0.1% is effective in 1 min (Table III) . That is why it seems appropriate to recommend a dilution 1:50 of standard bleach in the coronavirus setting. For the disinfection of small surfaces ethanol (62e71%; carrier tests) revealed a similar efficacy against coronavirus. A concentration of 70% ethanol is also recommended by the WHO for disinfecting small surfaces [13] .",25.693160875862027,12.466349953888669

Objectives: Although there has been an increase in available antiretroviral for pretreated patients, their high cost and short time since approved make nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) to be the most widely used backbone. However, since pre treated patients usually harbored mutations in reverse transcriptase, frequently tenofovir (TDF) and abacavir (ABC) are the only NRTI available. Since there are no reports about the combination of ABC and TDF, ans some concern about drug-drug interaction, we made a retrospective review to establish the effectiveness of ABC plus TDF as a NRTI backbone of HAART in pretreated patients. Methods: A single clinic retrospective study including all HIV-1 infected pretreated patients >18 years of age starting ABC-TDF irrespective of their prior HAART. The effectiveness was evaluated in an ITT analysis. Results: Forty-six patients, 31 men (67%) with a mean age of 43 years (28−65) and median CD4 cell count of 447 . Mean HIV-1 viral load was 29400 copies/mL (19-85600). Among the sample 12 patients (26%) had undetectable viral load when starting the combination. Failure, as defined, occurred in 26 patients (57%), with 21 patients (46%) having virological failure. The other 5 patients resumed therapy because side effects to any of the drugs (4 patients) or lost to follow up (1 patient). Among these 5 patients, 3 had undetectable HIV-1 viral load when stopped therapy. Median duration of therapy for non-failure patient was 27 months (11−54) and 12 months (3−33) for patients who resumed therapy. When stratified by viral load at the starting of therapy we found that patients who had undetectable viral load had better chance to keep on therapy than patients who started with detectable viral load 8/12 (66%) vs 12/34 (35%), almost reaching statistical significance (p = 0.061). Conclusion: TDF-ABC backbone should not be routinely used in HIV pre-treated patients. However, if the patient has undetectable viral load, the combination might be used with a high chance of success at 96 weeks follow-up in an ITT analysis.",21.403041600359156,7.956327481280203

She had stayed with patient 3 since their travel from China. She had mild symptoms, with sore throat and dry cough from Jan 28 (illness day 1), and a normal chest x-ray. Her cough, which was initially mild, increased transiently over time; she was asymptomatic from Feb 4 (illness day 8) without any specific treatment, and was discharged on Feb 17. Patients 4 and 5 had nasopharyngeal samples collected within the first 24 h of illness onset, allowing an early diagnosis of COVID-19. These early specimens had a high viral load, enabling whole-genome virus sequencing and virus isolation (table 2). The maximal normalised viral load obtained in their respiratory specimens were at 5·2 log 10 copies per 1000 cells for patient 4 and 7·4 log 10 copies per 1000 cells for patient 5 (based on the RdRp quantitative rtRT-PCR). This viral load in respiratory samples decreased over time (figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR was negative on illness day 12 for patient 4 and on illness day 16 for patient 5 (figure 2). These patients also had a positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stools, with viral load as high as 6·8 log 10 copies per g of stool for patient 4 and 8·1 log 10 copies per g of stool for patient 5. However, the virus was not detected in the serum or the urine samples. Patient 1 had nasopharyngeal samples collected at illness day 6 and patient 2 on day 9, which were positive by rtRT-PCR, with a SARS-CoV-2 viral load of 7·1 log 10 copies per 1000 cells, and detected but not quantifiable viral load, respectively. The whole-genome virus sequence was obtained by direct sequencing for patient 1 only; virus isolation was unsuccessful in both cases. The secondary evolution to severe disease in these two patients (days 10 and 11) was not correlated to any viral load increase (figure 2). Both received intravenous remdesivir when the viral load had already decreased below the detection threshold. During the whole course of the disease of these two patients, SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR was negative in stools, serum, and urine. At illness day 6, patient 3 (whose disease was classified as critical) was positive by RT-PCR in both a nasopharyngeal sample and bronchoalveolar lavage, with cycle threshold values for the E gene target (Charité protocol 14 ) of 30·3 and 27·4, and similar cycle threshold values for the house-keeping gene GAPDH of 25·7 and 24·7, respectively (table 2). The SARS-CoV-2 titres in the nasopharynx were stable (from 6·7 to 4·4 log 10 copies per 1000 cells) over time, although with a trend towards decrease after the first intravenous remdesivir dose, and thereafter when remdesivir was reinitiated ( figure 2) . This patient had a RNAaemia on illness day 8 and subsequently, with a low viral load (detected but below the quantification limit). During the course of the disease, he developed a pleural exudative effusion, with SARS-CoV-2 detection positive in the pleural fluid and negative bacterial cultures. Figure 3 illustrates the kinetics of the viral load in nasopharyngeal samples of all patients after disease onset. The viral load decreased over time and became negative between illness day 9 and 14 in four patients (patients 1, 2, 4, and 5).

With regards to the factors, mechanisms as well as principles that aid competent internalization and persistence of pathogens on produce, there are many variations. The available studies are difficult to compare largely because they have been conducted under varying physicochemical circumstances, types of microcosms, experimental conditions and used distinct strains (Shown in Tables 3e5). Most studies were conducted under disparate environmental conditions, and accurate weather data necessary to interpret results from the varying sources is lacking. Study results for one crop variety may indeed not hold true for other varieties, for instance, data for apples may not necessarily apply to all pome fruit and data for romaine lettuce may not apply to all leafy greens. When possible, varieties exhibiting greater potential for pathogen survival should be selected for experimental investigations. Another relevant consideration for crop selection is preference for varieties that are indigenous to the region in question. Some other seemingly trivial controversial issues include whether outer leaves are significantly more likely than inner leaves to become contaminated via splash and whether or not the potential for survival on the abaxial side of leaves is higher than on the adaxial side. The implications of dormant, non-dividing 'persister' cells occurring in certain plant pathogens on the ability to withstand environmental stresses and extensive survival as well as the issues surrounding linked resistance is still an important research debate. Also, even though atmospheric deposition seems to be an uncommon route of pathogenic contamination for produce, it has been documented as a potentially important route (Beuchat and Ryu, 1997; Harris et al., 2003; Mei Soon et al., 2012) . It will be worthwhile exploring how relevant this is for produce safety. While many of the available studies have made stringent efforts to simulate produce cultivation circumstances, it is extremely challenging to create precise/accurate environmental conditions in a laboratory setting. Most studies are conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. Factors like the biological activity of the soil, manure, water and crops, soil and water chemistries as well as meteorological elements such as wind, UV intensity, temperature, rainfall are simply impossible to replicate under laboratory conditions. Laboratory scale model systems may provide important details about the roles of environmental variables on pathogen growth and survival in agricultural environments, but the slightest tweaks in experimental protocols can affect pathogen survival in agroecosystems. Unfortunately, actual field-based studies are subject to disruption from unforeseen environmental events such as weather extremes and damage triggered by biological agents including insects or onset of plant diseases.",18.82867272734333,12.088197080432288

Pathogens could be either inactivated (losing their virulence) or thoroughly removed. Due to the biological origin, there are several environmental factors that affect pathogens' survival. The most important factors include: pH, temperature, humidity, ionic and osmotic strength, competition with other flora, light (ultra-violet -UV). The mechanisms of pathogen inactivation include cell disruption, proteolysis, protein denaturation, antibiosis, antagonism and nutrient deficiencies. Many WaW treatment technologies are based on the effect of these factors on the survival of pathogens. There are three main categories of treatment methods: (i) physical, (ii) chemical, and (iii) biological. Extensive research on this matter can be found in numerous extensive reviews (Amin et al., 2013; Asghar et al., 2015; Bicudo and Goyal, 2003; Franke-Whittle and Insam, 2013; Manyi-Loh et al., 2016; Matilainen and Sillanpää, 2010; Oller et al., 2011; Särkkä et al., 2015; Sobsey et al., 2006; Verbyla and Mihelcic, 2015) .

To correctly diagnose a pathogenic infection, it is crucial to precisely detect the presence of the infectious agent or the corresponding antibodies triggered by the immune response. An incorrect diagnosis leads to wrongly applied therapeutic strategies to the patients as well as an enormous risk in terms of patients life and costs [71] . The implementation of RT-qPCR for reliable quantification of viral loads in clinical specimens requires normalization against defined standards and internal controls. Diagnostic tests are generally based on the titration of the sample on an external standard curve which has been subjected to identical amplification steps. Different sample size can lead to altered readouts. It has been shown that sampling the same volume of blood from HIV positive (HIVþ) patients the yields of extracted RNA was significantly higher in HIVþ patients with less advanced immunosuppression (with a count of >200 cells/mL) compared to HIVþ patients with advanced immunosuppression (<200 cells/mL), making impossible the comparison of the two groups based on the processing of the same sample volumes [72] . Thus, diagnostic methods that compare the quantification of viral load to an internal standard/normalizer is needed. This problem was specifically highlighted by Jabs and colleagues, that developed a qPCR-based protocol for the quantification of EpsteineBarr virus (EBV) from PBMCs of transplanted patients as a predictive parameter for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs). The authors combined the co-amplification of EBV and genomic C-reactive protein DNA that served as an internal normalizer for the actual amount of viral DNA. They showed that, with the protocol without normalization, the detected EBV copy numbers were within the range of the control group in 4 out of 10 PTLD patients. On the other hand, after normalization, all of the PTLD patients showed higher amount of viral copy number compared to the control group, indicating that by introducing a normalization method for the virus detection the sensitivity and the accuracy of the assay increased [73] . More recently, an alternative method to normalize viral RNA from whole blood samples of cattle infected with Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) was developed by spiking the blood samples with an external RNA virus, the canine Enteric Coronavirus (CECov), before RNA extraction. Quantification and normalization by RT-qPCR allowed to detect the virus up to 14 days post-challenge while viral detection with the traditional protocol of virus isolation and infection in cell culture was detectable only until 7 days post-challenge [74] . Even though this method was applied in veterinary, the same strategy could be successfully applied to human samples. Altogether, RT-qPCR combined with a normalization strategy would result in a rapid, sensitive, and reliable detection of viral infections.",18.01187566501049,12.206262898979105

For example, in the 2 studies reporting the detection rates of each ORV, rhinovirus and RSV were most commonly detected. Only 1 study from Hong Kong (25) did not include rhinovirus, which could explain why this study had the highest proportion PAN-negative. The differences in proportion PAN-negative are likely to also be associated with viral load and shedding. With the exception of the Hong Kong study (25) , the studies involving children presented low proportions of PAN-negative subjects among all eligible subjects, which is consistent with observations of higher viral load and shedding from children (37) . The heterogeneity of viral shedding by age suggests potential misclassification bias in the PAN-negative group, where results may be more likely to be false-negative among samples taken from older patients. Other reasons for false-negative influenza results may be associated with suboptimal swab quality, imperfect laboratory testing methods, or long intervals from symptom onset to presentation (11) .

In their classification, several causes of death included in the intrinsic categories listed above were reassigned to extrinsic mortality, either because the principal etiological factor is an infectious agent (e.g., rheumatic heart disease, cervical cancer, infection of the kidney, chronic hepatitis, urinary tract infection), the abuse of a toxic substance (e.g., lung cancer, cirrhosis, drug dependence), or a food deficiency or excess (e.g., nutritional deficiency).",15.937339308136039,9.33490679343111

However, a number of technical challenges and limitations precluded this form of analysis. First, highly variable coverage levels of the viruses ranging from a single read to hundreds of reads of a virus were obtained, presumably due to variations in viral load as well as the relative abundance of the virus compared to other non-viral nucleic acid molecules in the sample. For samples with low coverage levels, it is impossible to determine whether multiple reads that align to different regions of the same reference virus are derived from the same or related but distinct viruses; therefore, it is challenging to accurately define the number of virus species present. Furthermore estimation of the viral load or copy number from the number of reads obtained is complicated by the sequence independent PCR step, which may introduce amplification biases. Due to these considerations, we conservatively chose to define viral diversity based on the presence or absence of sequences derived from each of the 95 virus families defined by the ICTV. Therefore, the virome of an individual sample was defined as the number and type of viral taxa with at least one representative sequence present in the sample. These conservative criteria will likely underestimate the true viral diversity of the sample.

Miller et al [21] recently reported similar findings in 175 URTI episodes in infants (<12 months) over 4 consecutive years. Our study also showed positive correlations between rhinovirus, symptoms, and AOM development. Other viruses highly associated with symptoms included RSV, influenza, and metapneumovirus; the seasonality of these 3 viruses may explain the higher rate of symptomatic infection during winter respiratory season and higher rate of asymptomatic infection from April to August. A recent casecontrol study performed in Sweden in children aged <5 years during non-influenza season also showed high proportion of RSV and metapneumovirus in symptomatic cases [22] . Prolonged presence of bocavirus may partially explain a lack of association between symptoms and this virus detection [23] . AOM occurs mostly as a bacterial complication of viral URTI. Our finding that asymptomatic viral infection did not lead to AOM highlights the fact that a necessary step in the pathogenesis of AOM is an inflammation of the nasopharynx and the Eustachian tubes severe enough to cause URTI symptoms and associated Eustachian tube dysfunction. We clearly showed a strong correlation between expression of URTI symptoms and high viral load for all viruses except for influenza, which only accounted for a small number. Others have also shown the correlation between viral load and symptom severity of specific viruses [23] [24] [25] [26] . It is interesting that the development of AOM was not associated with a higher viral load during URTI. In previous studies of an older cohort, we have also shown a lack of association between AOM complication and high viral load in metapneumovirus and bocavirus URTI [27, 28] . It is possible that viral load has lesser importance on the development of AOM when considered along with other known AOM risk factors such as demographic and genetic risks, feeding status, daycare attendance, nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization, pneumococcal antibody status, and type of URTI virus [2, 12, 29, 30] .",19.04100667092294,10.898297478045837

At present, the treatment is largely empirical and therefore controversial, ranging from supportive therapy without intervention to a combination of antivirals and steroids. A recent report on an open trial of a combination of a protease inhibitor and a nucleoside analogue against a historical control suggests a favourable clinical response using lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. 13 However, controversy remains as no controlled studies have been undertaken, and there is a need to set up international clinical trial networks to develop and perform clinical protocols should SARS reappear.",18.738269798321625,9.446208104816163

When the disease is maintained in the reservoir population, the stages are cyclic (1) → (2) → (3) → (4) → (1). A viral infection begins with contact or exposure of an animal host with a particular pathogen. At the first stage, environmental conditions including climate, seasonality, anthropogenic disturbances, landscape and resources (i.e., habitat, food, water) may individually or collectively determine whether there is contact between host and pathogen [15, 137] . In addition, the host's intrinsic characteristics, its population and social structure, mobility, behavior and susceptibility may modulate the extent of its exposure. In the second stage, the within-host and cellular level, the virus must overcome physical barriers of the host, and must be compatible with cell receptors to gain entry into a target cell. After viral entry, the third stage, viral replication depends on host and viral genetics as well as host factors such as the immune response, prior exposure, nutritional status, co-infection, age, sex and reproductive status. Establishment of an infection in one host does not necessarily mean transmission to another host, as it may be a dead-end host. Transmission, the fourth stage of infection, depends on viral load, mode of viral shedding, host factors and the community intraand inter-host ecological interactions. These latter interactions are also affected by the spatial environment and anthropogenic factors.",18.96649953290489,11.748889422393177

The first report published on April 10, 2003 [5] , indicated that extremely low concentrations of viral RNA existed in plasma of a SARS patient during the acute phase of illness, at 9 days after the onset of symptoms. The viral content of plasma was low. Researchers could only detect SARS-CoV RNA using a nested PCR assay established in-house, and the viral load was 190 copies/mL performed after ultracentrifugation of 2 mL of plasma. They could not detect viral RNA in the plasma collected from two close contacts, although the sputum of one was positive by 3 of 4 different PCR assays and the viral load in sputum was as high as 6.3×10 4 copies/mL. Based on this study and other information, WHO [10] and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [19] drafted recommendations on blood safety and pointed out a theoretical risk of transmission of the SARS virus through transfusion of blood products. They also recommended some precautionary principles regarding the deferral of blood donation by individuals from areas with recent local transmission. In addition, blood donors should report to collection agencies if they were diagnosed as suspected or confirmed SARS patients within 1 month following their donation; and in such instances, efforts would be made to trace recipients or recall any blood products not transfused. Later, two studies focused on new PCR methods for detection of SARS-CoV RNA. One study was based on serial analysis of plasma viral RNA concentrations in adult SARS patients by quantitative reversetranscription PCR with a limit of detection of 74 copies/mL. The study found that, on the first day of fever onset, 50% (6/12) of confirmed patients had detectable viral RNA in plasma and that, by day 14, the proportion fell to 25% (3/12). Overall, 78% of patients had detectable viral RNA in the first week of their illness [7] . Similar to the first study, the average viral concentration was low at 140 copies/mL in patients who had relatively mild symptoms and did not require intensive care unit admission in hospital. In pediatric patients, 87.5% (7/8) of children had viremia, and the median concentration of plasma was 357 copies/mL based on the same PCR method used with adult SARS patients above [8] . Finally, Grant et al [6] reported that within 3 days after fever onset, 79% (19/24) of patients had detectable SARS-CoV RNA in plasma. The viral load level rose fast, and the maximal viral load was at around day 4 or day 5 after the onset of fever, after which the viral load quickly decreased. Their findings showed viral shedding in plasma was common when people were clinically ill with SARS virus and that plasma may be a better sample compared with nasal and throat swabs.

The interactions of these signaling chemicals are complex, self-amplifying and feedback modulated, and allow for detecting the nature of the threat (e.g., pollutant, allergen, virus exposure), adaptively tailoring the evolution of a threat-appropriate immuneinflammatory host response to eliminate the source of the threat, and downregulating those responses once the threat has been eliminated. Figure 3 presents a simple interpretive model for understanding signal processing from initial virus exposure through the development of symptoms, signs and complications during the course of a vURTI and for defining the various nodes at which modulating factors can act. Briefly, virus exposure is processed by a set of biological filters that may or may not prevent infection and/or limit viral replication and viral spread to adjacent cells. These filters are tuned by environmental factors (e.g., air pollution, cigarette smoke exposure), genetic factors (e.g., HLA haplotypes), the functionality of existing physical barriers to infection (e.g., mucociliary clearance system) and the immune status of the host (e.g., extant presence of non-specific antiviral chemicals, homotypic sIgA antiviral antibody titers). If infection is established, viral sensors detect the event and trigger the activation and/or up-regulation of the innate immune system and of both the humoral and cellular components of the adaptive immune systems. In turn, these systems up-regulate the activities of the biological filters with the teleological goals of progressively decreasing viral load, limiting viral spread to adjacent anatomical compartments, eliminating infected cells, preventing secondary bacterial infections, establishing immune memory to prevent re-infection with the same virus and healing the damaged mucosa [26] . Failure to achieve threat-appropriate responses or to adequately coordinate the up-and down-regulation of these responses can lead to the development of an exaggerated inflammatory response as well as to vURTI complications.",20.448747598328428,10.645683943350496

Objectives: To assess the clinical relevance of the relation between viral load, determined by cycle threshold (CT) value of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays and disease severity in children with single-and multiple viral ARI. Study design: 582 children with ARI were prospectively followed and tested for 15 viruses. Correlations were calculated between CT values and clinical parameters. Results: In single viral ARI, statistically significant correlations were found between viral loads of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and hospitalization and between viral loads of Human Coronavirus (HCoV) and a disease severity score. In multiple-viral ARI, statistically significant correlations between viral load and clinical parameters were found. In RSV-Rhinovirus (RV) multiple infections, a low viral load of RV was correlated with a high length of hospital stay and a high duration of extra oxygen use. The mean CT value for RV, HCoV and Parainfluenza virus was significantly lower in single-versus multiple infections. Conclusion: Although correlations between CT values and clinical parameters in patients with single and multiple viral infection were found, the clinical importance of these findings is limited because individual differences in host-, viral and laboratory factors complicate the interpretation of statistically significant findings.

This correlates well with D'Alessio et al. who found that the secondary attack rate was related to the viral concentration in the nose [4] . Inoculum seems to be a restrictive factor for transmission, with infectiousness rapidly dropping below a given concentration. As infected children appear to have a higher viral load than adults, this may explain why children are considered to be the main transmission vector. The fact that the viral load in LC droplets was below the level of detection explains why the virus could not be recovered at these concentrations, except in one case without a passage on fingers. LC droplets correspond to the viral concentration recovered in rhinovirus-infected adults and this suggests that transmission via adults occurs rarely. A recent study investigating the transmission of cold-like illnesses between siblings showed that younger children tended to become infected first in most cases. However, the secondary attack rate was greater for older siblings, probably because of a higher viral load in younger siblings' secretions. As younger children tend also to touch nasal secretions directly with their fingers, it is probable that this enhances transmission. The viral load in the mucus of more than 1000 rhinovirus-infected children below 1 year of age was 5.79 × 10 e6 TCID 50 /mL, which is 10 to 100 times higher than our HC of 1 × 10 e5 (Regamey et al., private communication).

The effective standard is the viral load decreased at least by 0.5 log after 4-week or 1 log after an 8-week antiviral therapy or the viral load reduced to 1,000 copies/ml after a 16-24-week therapy. Finally, the viral load has some values in predicting the progress of AIDS. For example, the viral load can predict the probability ( p value) of becoming AIDS in 6 years for patients with normal CD4+ counts. The p value is 0.054 when the viral load is less than 500 copies/ml and the p value dramatically increased to 0.8 when the viral load is more than 30,000 copies/ml. When CD4+ counts are less than 200/µl, the viral load can be used to predict a shorter progress of AIDS. The probability of turning to AIDS within 3-6 months from viral carrier is proportionally associated with the viral load values. A similar conclusion was drawn from a recent clinical trial including 751 HIV-infected patients with b200 CD4+/mm 3 before HAART (Torti et al. 2007 ) . Patients with higher CD4+ T-cell counts following the treatment appeared to have survived after month 3, whereas those with increasing HIV RNA N400 copies/ml did not. The three methods currently employed in commercial kits for HIV-1 viral load assays are rt-PCR-, b DNA-, and NASBA-based assays. Table 28 .4 shows the comparison of three FDA-approved HIV-1 viral load assays commonly used in assessment with their advantages and disadvantages. The major difference between these assays is the requirement of specifi c equipment rather than their sensitivity or specifi city. Therefore, the resources of the various settings remain the Sequencing in bulk is error-prone determinant factor for choosing the PCR-based, hybridization-based, or isothermal amplifi cationbased HIV detection assays. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-or rt-PCR-based assay is the most frequently used technology in molecular biology and molecular diagnostics. PCR-based assays can be used for either the qualitative or quantitative analysis of HIV. As HIV is a retrovirus, both PCR and rt-PCR are used as qualitative assays of viral infection targeting the integrated form of provirus or the free HIV themselves, respectively. The rt-PCR is however specifi cally required in HIV viral load assay. The amplifi ed products from PCR or rt-PCR can be visualized by a variety of methods, such as agarose gel electrophoresis, real-time visualization, and enzymatic reaction. One commercial kit, Amplicor, uses enzymatic reaction for product visualization with microplate platform (Murphy et al. 2000 ) .",24.683687556640287,13.399824239909243

The increasing viral load during this phase suggests that the symptoms are largely related to the effect of viral replication and cytolysis; however, this may also be due to antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies. In phase 2, which begins about 8 days after onset of fever, patients frequently had recurrence of fever, onset of diarrhea, and oxygen desaturation. The timing of IgG seroconversion, which starts on day 10, seems to correlate with falls in viral load, which occurs between days 10 and 15. Severe clinical worsening also occurs at this time.

Certainly, this is not consistent with analytical perspectives of aerosol chemistry or the understanding of microorganisms in aquatic environments and potable water supplies. There are three reasons contributing to this knowledge gap. First, atmospheric sciences have traditionally been paired with the analytical chemistry efforts needed to investigate the air pollution of the industrial age. A consequence of this tradition is that extensive chemical rather than biological characterization of the atmosphere exists and that few scientists or engineers have complementary aerosol and biotechnology skill sets. The second reason is the difficulty in detecting airborne microorganisms due to their dilute nature (Roy and Milton, 2004) . For microorganisms, the atmosphere is an extreme and oligotrophic environment, and compared with sampling practices for food, aquatic, and terrestrial environments, microorganism collection from ambient air presents a significant technological challenge. Bioaerosol sampling equipment has collection efficiencies less than 100%, and these efficiencies vary significantly with the aerodynamic diameter of airborne particulate matter. Further, conventional collection devices that harvest particulate matter from air introduce significant sampling stresses, which can substantially reduce the viability and/or culturability of a broad range of airborne microorganisms (Buttner et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 1995) .",19.130081796065266,9.284813549315286

Objective: To evaluate the correlation of viral load as well as viral and bacterial co-infections with disease severity in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Study design: This is a prospective study conducted in children admitted for LRTIs for two seasons. To determine viral and bacterial load of respiratory pathogens we performed multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and semiquantitative bacterial cultures on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Results: During the study period 244 (60%) children were hospitalized for LRTI with acute virus-induced wheezing and 160 (40%) for radiologic confirmed pneumonia. In the first NPA, viruses were identified in 315 (78%) of the 404 samples and bacteria in 198 (63.3%) of 311 samples. The viral load significantly decreased between the first and second NPA sample in most single and viral co-infections, except rhinovirus and human bocavirus infections. Viral load was inversely related to CRP in RSV infections, whereas a positive correlation was observed in adenovirus infections. Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in RSV single infections compared to rhinovirus single infections whereas in the latter, leucocytosis and use of systemic steroids was more common. In RSV viral co-infections the presence of fever, leucocytosis, and the use of antibiotics was significantly more frequent.

Furthermore, just as LRT infections and higher viral load among fatal cases may increase the probability of direct secondary infections, such clinical manifestations may also increase the probability of indirect transmission. Thus, under the assumption that the statistical results from Analysis 1 are applicable to other nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-coronavirus, contact tracing should be prioritized for cases that fail to recover (post-mortem), as well as for cases that have a high risk of mortality, such as the comorbid and the elderly. 34, 35 While human-to-human transmission contributed substantially to nosocomial amplification during the 2015 South Korean MERS outbreak, it is possible that environmental contaminationas noted above-played a role as well. The relevant literature suggests that fomite and indoor ventilation system transmission may be the mechanism through which environmental contamination potentially amplifies disease transmission in hospital settings (Table 4 ). Although fomite transmission of viral pathogens is notoriously challenging to eliminate (e.g., via sanitization), simulation studies involving computational fluid dynamics suggest that low-cost solutions for the mitigation of indoor ventilation system transmission may exist. 36, 37 Unfortunately, such simulations remain limited in terms of use for recommendations due to lack of calibration and excessive utilization of free parameters, as well as notable absences of physical modeling for critical small-scale processes, such as mixing and pathogen re-suspension among others. However, recent validation studies -which have directly measured the role of violent respiratory events (e.g., sneezing and coughing) on indoor environmental contamination-show a new path ahead where pathogen loads, transport and mixing from a range of patient types can be addressed. 19, 20, 31 Moving forward, such studies will likely be integral to the development and effective deployment of more robust solutions for low cost redesign of indoor ventilation systems and patient-specific pathogen containment strategies, Translatability of these findings to Saudi Arabia, where MERScoronavirus is endemic and causes frequent nosocomial outbreaks, requires deeper consideration given the additional complexity posed by the prevalence of zoonotic transmissions from dromedary camels to humans, as well as the occurrence of household and community spread. It is possible that the characteristics associated with human-to-human transmission in hospital settings, though the former is much more common. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] As a result, the role of zoonotic cases and human-to-human transmission in nosocomial settings must be further explored. A rich data set recently obtained from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health-which includes information on demographic characteristics (e.g., case outcome, zoonotic and human contacts) and clinical manifestations (e.g., presence or absence of LRT infection, viral load) of cases that have sought care at government hospitals during nosocomial MERS outbreaks-may allow us to investigate the possible relationship between camelacquired cases and direct secondary transmissions caused by said cases in the near future.",20.95809839149912,11.822088782918552

A recently published controlled clinical trial demonstrated a benefit of systemic prednisolone in children with picornavirus (i.e. rhinovirus or enterovirus) LRTI. 22 The high incidence of fever and leucocytosis might explain the higher rate of antibiotic use in RSV viral co-infections compared to RSV single infections in our study. However, viral factors may be responsible for RSV subgroup-related disease severity differences, including differences in the ability of certain viruses to promote a pathogenic inflammatory host response. 23 Previous studies have investigated the relationship of viral load and viral dynamics to etiological role and disease severity in respiratory tract infections. 24, 25 Gerna et al. found a significant drop in RSV viral load between admission and discharge in children hospitalized for RSV LRTI. 8 In contrast, Bosis et al. did not find a significant impact of the RSV viral load on the disease severity in children admitted to hospital for the first episode of acute wheezing. 16 There were also no significant correlation of viral load and disease severity in human bocavirus infections. 26 This study is the first to investigate the influence of the viral load and viral dynamics of a broad range of respiratory viruses and different clinical correlates of disease severity and inflammatory parameters in blood in a multiplex PCR assay. We found a consistent fall of the viral load between admission and discharge in single infections with most of the viral pathogens (significant for RSV, parainfluenza virus and hMPV single and additionally adenovirus co-infections). Since patients were discharged from hospital when they were clinically improved, a relationship between viral load and disease severity can be assumed.

While detection of viral genomes in clinical samples indicates virus infection, the result does not provide information about the stage and dynamic of the virus infection. In many cases the progress of viral replication can be assumed from changes in viral load, but this approach requires multiple sampling during infection and varies between individuals. One major advantage for detection of spliced viral transcripts is that viral RNA splicing reflects viral gene expression and thus indicates active viral infection, providing important information about the status of infection without requiring multiple sampling. The production of viral transcripts and their RNA splicing products are often the first sign of virus replication detectable before the increase of viral load or occurrence of viral-specific antigens or antibodies. Therefore, the detection of active viral infection by RNA splicing may be particularly important for early diagnosis of viral infection and may be critical for successful treatment. Because of direct association of spliced viral transcripts with the level of active viral replication and by monitoring viral RNA, one might be able to provide essential information early enough for initiation of antiviral therapy. A rapid shutoff of viral transcription and RNA splicing could be also the first sign of the blockage of viral replication visible even before the change in viral load by genome copy numbers. In the case of ubiquitous and common viruses, such as members of herpesvirus or parvovirus family, which establish latent infection in the host, detection of RNA splicing of a viral early gene would assist to distinguish viral latent infection from active lytic infection. Such a diagnosis is critical for recipients of the transplant organs where reactivation of latent viruses often leads to transplant rejection.",21.460679377679213,10.688170462794567

Most of the HBoV-positive patients aged less than 3 yr belonged to the high-viral-load group. The detection rate was lower (1.5%) in patients aged more than 10 yr, and these patients belonged exclusively to the low-viral-load group. HBoV is rarely detected in adults except in cases of immunosuppression [10, 16, 17]. The lower detection rate and viral load of HBoV in older patients may be attributed to immunity acquired from an infection at a younger age. A seroepidemiologic study of HBoV showed that 5.6-83.3% of children aged 6 months-3 yr were seropositive for HBoV [18]. Lau et al.

We found variable rates of shedding across our sampling period. In Singapore, temperatures are not variable month to month, but there are two monsoon seasons, which may be associated with bat borne virus shedding [43]. A study on Myotis myotis in Germany demonstrated distinct astrovirus amplification peaks that correlated with the formation of a suitable roost size and also a post-parturition period [45]. In the tropics, where there is lower seasonal variation and an absence of torpor, the reproductive behavior of bats may drive virus persistence [46].

The RSV and HMPV finding is consistent with other reports that show these viruses to be leading causes of LRTI in children and adults [28–30]. In contrast, the role of HBoV as a cause of severe infections is less well established. Because HBoV infection is very common and frequently found in asymptomatic participants, the pathogenic role of this virus has been questioned [31, 32]. Children with higher viral loads tend to have more severe infections [33], longer hospitalization duration [34, 35], and are found to have co-infection by other viruses [36, 37] less frequently than those with lower viral loads. However, in children in daycare, viral load had no apparent association with severity of illness [31], which also might reflect challenges in reproducibly measuring viral load in secretions. In all, these studies suggest that HBoV is frequently present in children as an asymptomatic or chronic infection with low viral loads, whereas some infections in which a high viral load is present may be associated with severe infections requiring hospitalization. Our study did not measure viral load, so it is unclear if our HBoV participants represented a sample of high–viral load participants, as we did not include asymptomatic participants with HBoV.",22.591402355135465,11.51947020109032

This difference in the codetection frequency is attributed to the different detection methods; molecular diagnostic methods were used for the detection of other respiratory viruses in the other studies whereas we used virus culturing. Among the 17 HBoV-positive patients who were also positive for infection with other viruses, 10 showed PIV infection. The high association of HBoV with PIV seems to be attributed to the high prevalence of PIV infection in 2006 (22.8% in May). Interestingly, almost all cases (except two) positive for both HBoV and another respiratory virus belonged to the low-viral-load group. As the virus culture was used for the detection of major respiratory viruses, the isolated virus could be the main causative agent of respiratory illness. Therefore, the presence of low copy number of HBoV, detected by molecular method, may indicate prolonged viral shedding or an asymptomatic infection. Recently, prolonged presence of HBoV in NPAs has been reported [21]. These results suggest that single HBoV infection in the high-viral-load group may play an active role in respiratory infection. These findings are consistent with a Norwegian study that reported detection of HBoV alone and a high-viral-load were associated with respiratory tract infection [20]. In that study, patients with a high-viral-load in NPAs developed viremia more frequently than the patients with a moderate-or a low-viral-load did.

Cases of HBoV infection show a high rate of co-infections with other viral and bacterial respiratory and gastroenteritis pathogens, such as human rhinovirus, adenovirus, norovirus, rotavirus[6,73,81-83]. Notably, co-infecting pathogens have been found in up to 83% of respiratory samples[14,18,70,84]. In particular, co-infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) occurs very frequently (89.5%)[85]. HBoV1 remains detectable in NPA samples of immune-competent subjects for up to 6 mo after infection[86,87]. Consequently, HBoV1 is often detectable with other viruses in asymptomatic patients, facilitating the reactivation of a latent virus by a super-infection[88]. Despite a low tropism of the virus being demonstrated in the human body[31,89], HBoV shows a high persistence in some sites, in particular the lymphatic tissue[33]. The persistence and reactivation of HBoV may explain the high prevalence of co-infections[90], although its effects and mechanisms are still unclear and its contribution to active disease remains to be accurately established[88]. In addition, individuals with low viral load are more likely to be co-infected with other pathogens compared to those with high viral load (57% vs 38.9%)[84]. Clinically relevant infections, requiring hospitalization of the subject, are associated with co-infections of up to six different pathogens in a single patient[91,92]. Furthermore, high viral load (> 104 copies/mL) has been shown in multiple studies to be statistically associated with severe clinical manifestations and longer hospitalization[35,84,93]. In contrast to these findings, however, Ghietto et al[85], who screened 1135 respiratory samples from children and adults, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, found no association between high viral load and illness; yet, they did demonstrate that all asymptomatic subjects had a low viral load (P < 0.005). High viral load (> 106 copies/mL) in NPA was reported by Christensen et al[94]; their study also demonstrated that viremia was more frequent in the subjects with high viral load (70%) than in those with a moderate or low virus load (10%). Hence, on the basis of the data reported in the literature to date, the role of this virus as a harmless passenger, rather than a true infecting agent, is still debatable, and, therefore, it remains to be established.",21.52408691031483,9.416771039604757

Assays to quantify hepatitis B and C virus load in liver tissue have also been described [83, 84]. HBV DNA detection and HBV DNA viral load are also essential to explore a viral reactivation. Real-time PCR quantification assays are widely used because of their sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, broad dynamic range and positive predictive values. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined international standards [85]. However, because of these techniques do not use the same HBV primers, follow up of patients should be carried out with the same technical assay in order to compare viral DNA load evolution.

A series of negative results does not rule out the possibility of MERS-CoV infection [13]. Possible explanations for false-negative MERS-CoV test results include low viral load very early or late in the illness, inadequate sputum samples due to poor sample collection from patients with dry cough or no cough, inappropriate sample handling or shipping, and technical issues, such as viral genome mutation or PCR inhibition [3]. Sufficient nucleic acid extraction and the removal of substances that inhibit amplification are critical factors influencing the detection of MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR [4]. However, rRT-PCR of sputum samples yields conflicting results owing to the difficulty of extracting RNA from sputum containing mucus. Many reports have indicated that lower respiratory samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and sputum contain the highest viral loads [3567]. However, one report indicated that no significant difference occurred in viral load cycle threshold (Ct) values between sputa and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) [].

Furthermore, these methods could be applied to parasite, bacterial and fungal pathogen discovery by sequencing total RNA that contains expressed pathogen RNA. Expressed pathogens could be discovered incidentally through RNA-Seq data.

Rapid clinical progression was defined as when the time to treatment initiation (CD4+ <350 cells/μl) or time to an estimated CD4+ lymphocyte count lower than 350 cells/μl was within 1 year of seroconversion. Those who did not show a significant CD4+ T-cell decline were defined as nonprogressors [13]. Initial and peak viremia levels were defined according to the dynamics of HIV-1 viremia in acute HIV-1-infected patients [14]: initial viral load indicates HIV-1 viral load detected at Fiebig stage II–III [14], and peak viremia level refers to the highest viral load detected during the acute HIV-1 infection. For set-point definition, the established criteria described by Fellay et al.[13] were strictly followed, defining the three-phase evolution of HIV-1 viremia to calculate the average viral load set-point (Table 1).",22.386048842478246,11.528149407260575

In infectious diseases such as babesiosis, heart may suffer from the same pathological processes described in other organs, such as inflammation and hypoxia, causing pericardial effusion. However in this study CBVD were not found more often in dogs with pericardial effusion compared with neoplastic effusion, therefore a cause‐effect relationship can not be stablished with those results. Interestingly some infectious disease such as bartonellosis are suggested to have oncogenic potential and more research is needed to clarify the possible role of infectious diseases in dogs with neoplastic pericardial effusion.

They perceive two main approaches to dual use technology: the Anglo-American pragmatic approach and the continental metaphysical approach (Pustovit and Williams 2008). According to the authors these approaches are based on different understandings of technology: the Anglo-American approach “is associated with technology notion as a sequence of processes and operations aimed to products with necessary and useful for people properties. The second one with enough neutral definition-understanding of technology as use of organized knowledge for aiming at practical goals by systems of machines and people” (Pustovit and Williams 2008, p. 2). In their view the Anglo-American approach is directed at concrete technologies, the continental one also at the role and intentions of people. The authors illustrate the ‘American’ view by referring to the phrase “dual use research of concern” that has been developed in the—already mentioned—famous Fink-report of the National Research Council of the National Academies (2004), the starting point and analytical fundament of the present biosecurity debate in the United States, and not only there. Dual Use Research of Concern is defined as “research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied by others to pose a threat to public health and safety, agriculture, plants, animals, the environment, or material” (National Research Council of the National Academies 2004).

When prevalence is high, then it is likely that the optimal size of the pool will have to be very small and the method is unlikely to present a dramatic reduction in resource use. On the other hand, we recommend using the second RT-PCR pooling method proposed to identify individuals only on samples from individuals who exhibit symptoms. The optimal pool size depends on the sensitivity of the test, and this is a function of viral load. Salivary viral load has been found to be highest in the first week after the onset of symptoms.23 While patients are asymptomatic, early in infection, the viral load is low making this technique unlikely to be useful in these individuals.",21.915593870814348,11.887378385581073

In the 116 longitudinal sampling portion of our study, we were able to detect 14 viruses including seven 117 human rhinovirus (HRV), two coronavirus (CoV), one bocavirus (BoV), two adenovirus (ADV), 118 one human metapneumovirus (MPV) and one respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases. There 119 were four instances of viral co-infection, though in each case a dominant virus was evident 120 based on greater duration of shedding and higher viral load (Fig 2a) . 121 122 Duration of shedding was heterogeneous. In 5 cases, HRV shedding lasted more than a week 123 with one instance of 5-day shedding and one short single-day blip. RSV and MPV episodes 124 were both prolonged. ADV, BoV and CoV shedding was short-lived, though in one case low-125 level ADV shedding was evident throughout the sampling period (Fig 2a) . 126 127 During most extended periods of HRV, RSV and HMPV shedding, viral loads were remarkably 128 stable from sample to sample (Fig 2a) . For HRV, a generalized pattern of viral load steady state 129 or slight gradual decline, followed by rapid elimination was noted. The single case of RSV had a 130 similar profile but with an initial high viral load peak and shorter duration of shedding. The single 131 case of MPV had a more protracted decline with a single re-expansion phase. These transiently 132 observed periods of steady state viral loads are highly unlikely to occur by chance if true viral 133 loads fluctuated or exhibited stochastic noise. Thus, the sampling method appears highly 134 reliable. These data also suggest a brief period of equilibrium between the virus and local 135 immune system before viral elimination. 136 137 .

Enveloped viruses mimic apoptotic bodies by exposing PS on the outer leaflet of the 57 viral membrane. While TIM-1 has been shown to serve as an adherence factor/receptor for 58 filoviruses in tissue culture, limited studies have investigated the role of TIM-1 as a receptor in 59 vivo. Here, we sought to determine if TIM-1 was critical for Ebola virus glycoprotein-mediated 60 infection using a BSL2 model virus. We demonstrate that loss of TIM-1 expression results in 61 decreased virus load late during infection and significantly reduced virus-elicited mortality. 62 These findings provide evidence that TIM-1 serves as an important receptor for Ebola virus in 63 vivo.
