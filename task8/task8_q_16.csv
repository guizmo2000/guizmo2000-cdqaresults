Consequently, our results complement the PHEP Capabilities by highlighting the circumstances in which related activities or functions might have particular relevance in practice. Not surprisingly, our study finds that certain types of events were much more likely to elicit response activities related to particular capabilities, and that the frequencies with which capability-related activities were performed did not necessarily equate with how ''essential'' that capability was to the overall event. For example, the epidemiology and surveillance capability was almost universally activated. However, it was more likely to be considered ''essential'' for certain types of incidents, particularly infectious disease events. Linking our results to the CDC PHEP Capabilities framework may be of particular value to preparedness planners, for example, by guiding the selection of exercise scenarios that would be most likely to trigger activities related to the capabilities they seek to assess or improve. In addition to the original PHEP Capabilities, we also asked participants about four additional categories of activities that were identified through our previous research and pilot testing as (1) important and (2) of a different character than the PHEP Capabilities. These activities included: environmental or product investigation, consulting subject matter experts, assessing public health or medical capacity, and evacuation.

In our hands, the cost reduction is roughly a 25%-50% reduction compared to traditional capillary sequencing when thorough follow-up is employed to resolve all variant calls and rare no-calls. The exact reduction depends on the degree of multiplexing employed in the up-front PCR step and the amount of follow-up sequencing that is needed.

If a virus has R < 0.3, FastViromeExplorer discards the virus. This criterion is motivated by the observation that some viruses detected by our tool only have reads mapped to the repeat regions of their genomes. For example, while analyzing the fecal samples from Lee et al. (2017), we found that for the BeAn 58058 virus (NC_032111.1), all the reads were mapped to one particular region of its genome, from 8,200 bp to 8,700 bp (see Fig. S1 ). Analyzing this region using RepeatMasker (Smit, Hubley & Green, 1996) revealed that it is a simple repeat region and falls into the class of Alu elements. If the virus is truly present in the sample, we expect reads to be mapped to not only the repeat region but also other regions of the genome. Therefore, finding this virus is likely an artifact caused by the prevalence of repeat regions instead of real biological signals. If the reads are all mapped to a repeat region, the observed coverage of the virus genome C o is expected to be much lower than C e , as a result, R is low and by imposing a cutoff of 0.3 (determined based on our empirical analyses), viruses that have reads mapped to only repeat regions get filtered out.",21.620030180735377,7.738511917758032

The key interests addressed in this study included whether sequencing can detect PRRSV strains to identify an outbreak as occurring due to the introduction of a new strain or recirculation of a previous outbreak, whether sequencing can generate whole genome information to aid in further understanding of PRRSV epidemiology, and whether sequencing can detect and differentiate multiple strains in a single sample to investigate outbreaks that occur in vaccinated herds or co-infection of multiple field-strains. Previously, PRRSV whole genomes have been generated using Sanger and Illumina sequencing technologies [10, 47, 72] . While both sequencing technologies can generate a whole PRRSV genome with more than 99.9% accuracy, the raw reads produced are usually less than 1500 bp. As a result, in order to generate a PRRSV whole genome, multiple primer sets and multiple individual sequencing reactions are needed for Sanger sequencing which is labor and time consuming; or for Illumina, computing resource intensive genome assembly is needed which requires time and knowledge to perform effectively. Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing, on the other hand, can generate ultra-long raw reads which are in theory only limited by input fragment length [73] . This feature is beneficial, since it saves time and effort when generating a whole genome sequence. In this study, we successfully generated PRRSV raw reads up to the length of the entire genome (15 kb) with an approximate 86% identity to the known input genome sequence.

It has been reported that both Sanger and Illumina sequencing can accurately detect PRRSV strains present in a sample, but both require transcription of RNA into cDNA followed by PCR amplification prior to sequencing [10, 72] . Differing from this, MinION technology directly sequences RNA strands for detection of PRRSV strains. This feature is beneficial since no reverse transcription or PCR are needed thus eliminating biases that those introduce and saving time since extra steps need not be performed, which allows for same day disease investigation. Moreover, direct RNA sequencing allows for the detection of nucleotide analogs which have been correlated with numerous diseases [74] . Most importantly, the MinION sequencer is cost-effective and easily accessible, without the investment of expensive sequencing and bioinformatics infrastructure. Despite the low raw read accuracy of direct RNA sequencing (~86%), which is the main concern with this technology, PRRSV strains were identified with 99.9% accuracy using as few as 5 raw reads (3 kb total yield). This accurate strain-level detection, even though the sequence accuracy is low, allows for guidance on determining effective control methods due to the precise detection of the circulating strains on a farm. Now knowing the potential of DRS for strain level detection of pathogens as determined through this study as well as others [75] , we next investigated the analytical sensitivity of PRRSV detection to determine its usefulness for obtaining reliable sequencing results. Previous research examining analytical sensitivity of next-generation sequencing has reported sensitivities that are similar or less sensitive than RT-qPCR [28, 76] , and the third-generation Oxford Nanopore DRS has previously shown a sensitivity of 1.89 × 10 7 viral copies in an influenza virus study [44] . Our results indicated that samples with a minimum of 10 4 to 10 6 viral copies, depending on the sample type, can be successfully sequenced to accurately identify strains after about 6 hours of sequencing. Although DRS is not as sensitive as PCR for use as a diagnostic tool identifying viral presence [77, 78] , it can be used for further investigation of the strain causing an outbreak, either directly from high viral load samples or following amplification of virus in cell culture. Additionally, a very strong correlation was observed between the number of viral reads generated through sequencing and the starting number of viral copies, indicating sequencing reads can be predicted by viral copies in a sample and vice versa, which has been confirmed by other studies as well [28] . Interestingly, the observation that the sensitivity of sequencing was higher from cell culture virus spiked into serum as opposed to clinical serum samples suggests that sample handling or perhaps the quality of the sample was an important factor for sequencing sensitivity [79] , thus emphasizing the importance of careful handling, transporting, and storing of clinical samples to protect the viral RNA from degradation [80, 81] . This also suggests that on-site sequencing of samples as opposed to a centralized diagnostic system may allow for higher sensitivity of detection due to the ability to immediately process samples after sampling.",15.52636681522481,8.460017264723215

Several methods have been developed and applied to PRRSV diagnosis, which are well described by Ko et al. [64] . Currently, PRRSV diagnostics mainly includes anti-PRRSV antibody detection by serological testing and nucleic acid detection using PCR based assays. Sequencing of PRRSV began in the mid-1990s, to discriminate between strains, which mainly focused on open reading frame 5 (ORF5) or other short regions of interest, but rarely encompassed the complete genome due to technological and monetary limitations [65, 66] . PRRSV ORF5 shows extensive genetic diversity and has been used for providing insight into PRRSV epidemiology, however it is only 5% of the whole genome, thus 95% of the genomic information remains for prediction of genetic variation. Whole genome sequencing is greatly needed to provide a more complete picture of the virus [67, 68] , which is now gradually becoming more feasible with the rapid development and innovation of new sequencing technologies [69, 70] . Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) is revolutionary for sequencing RNA viral genomes, since it can sequence the RNA directly, allowing for detection of methylation sites and decreasing bias inherent in reverse transcription and PCR amplification of samples prior to sequencing, and it can generate long reads, allowing for the elucidation of recombination events [71] .",18.1654770869839,8.014258649407797

With third generation sequencing technologies, single DNA molecules can be analyzed individually [e.g., 259] and, therefore, haplotypes can be determined. These advances are expected to revolutionize NHFG. Among other examples, MPS was already applied to the identification of species for quality control in the development and authentication of herbal and traditional medicines [260] and for the discrimination of soils and other detritus from alternative environments and locations, based on the composition of the microflora, plants, metazoan, and protozoa DNA sequences [21, [261] [262] [263] [264] [265] . As noted in MF, the implementation of MPS is particularly useful for epidemiological studies. However, more research is necessary for the improvement of libraries (i.e., reference sequences reflecting the coverage of the entire genome of diverse organisms), development of bioinformatics platforms (i.e., for decreasing memory requirements and implementing algorithms for parallel computing) and for reproducibility and assignment of general quality of the results. Moreover, current MPS technologies still present relatively high sequencing errors [e.g., 266] which, although could be assumed for other disciplines, may not meet forensic standards [267] . Therefore, strict MPS validation studies are mandatory but they are still very scarce, even in human applications.",17.519940947074538,7.831548911435004

Our approach is based on capturing the antibody repertoire of antibody-secreting PCs from both bone marrow and spleen of immunized transgenic mice. Recently, other laboratories have used mouse spleen PCs (24), mouse bone marrow PCs (25), human peripheral blood PCs (26, 27) , or human MBC from patient recovered from infection (28) to obtain antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies. Basically, those methods utilize single-cell sorting, single-cell RT-PCR, and natural VH-VL pairing (27, 28) . Screening methods have been developed to improve efficiency and enable detection of antigenspecific secreting cells before a single-cell RT-PCR step, such as enzyme-linked immunospot (29) , immunospot array assay on chip or microengraving (30) . Recently, a method was described (24) omitting a screening step, utilizing massive DNA sequencing and bioinformatics tools to analyze the VL and VH gene repertoires and to find several abundant VH and VL sequences that are paired based on their relative frequencies with 78% efficiency and a method that combines the next-generation sequencing and protein mass spectroscopy to obtain antigen-specific antibody repertoires (31) . DeKosky and colleagues developed a low-cost, single-cell, emulsion-based technology for sequencing of antibody VH-VL repertoires with even better pairing precision of >97% (32). The 4HVH transgenic mice produce human HCAb, without light chains, thus there is no pairing or the necessity for singlecell RT-PCR. The major concern was the solubility of human VH domains, that are not soluble per se, but as our results show, antigen-specific HCAbs selected through our screen show high solubility both as a full-length HCAbs and as VH fragments only, thus, the method allows easy isolation of soluble VH regions and the construction of multivalent soluble VH complexes.",15.03078126629169,7.4081501414576305

Sequencing of attenuated derivatives of virulent FIPV strains shows good correlation between deletions in ORF7b and attenuation of virulence [21] . This latter observation indicates that the 7b protein encoded by ORF7b is important for virulence. Thus, the virulence-associated ORF7b may be somewhat suppressed in FECVs not adapted to tissue culture, and the presence of an intact ORF3c in these FECVs may be involved in this suppression. Moreover, two cats from the same household were found to contain distinct ORF3c deletions, demonstrating that these two FIPVs were independently derived from FECV and not transmitted horizontally [9] .",19.340167610014724,10.17274168218954

A variety of studies have used transcriptional data [42, 49] to narrow QTL regions into candidate genes. However, transcriptional analysis can be confounded by the dynamic nature of transcriptional responses, and can also be confounded by SNPs residing underneath the expression probes that can impact binding [77, 78] . An alternate approach, taking advantage of the allelic complexity of the CC is the use of the sequence of the founder strains [57] to interpret the mapping results and to prioritize candidate genes within QTL. This approach is quite powerful; as causative polymorphisms must be contained within QTL regions, and has been used effectively in other pre-CC studies [49, 55] . However, Mx1 provides a cautionary note for regions of the genome in that there is a large in/del differentiating the eight CC founders. In fact, C57BL/6J, and thus the assembly, has the deletion. In such regions, functional genomic features may be misannotated and more importantly the genetic variants present in founders without the deletion is currently not annotated. This lack of annotation makes it difficult to conclusively dissect the polymorphisms within these regions that might cause phenotypic variation across the population, and currently requires more intensive sequencing efforts on a case-by-case basis. The Mx1 result illustrates the importance of improving the annotation of genetic variants in the mouse genome. It also suggests that in addition of the processed lists of SNPs and in/dels available at the Mouse Genome Projects from the Sanger Institute, the analysis of the allele effect in QTL intervals should be analyzed by searching for signatures of structural variation that might be present in the raw reads.

The median variant frequency for samples #27 and #59 was 0.5% but 6% for sample #1. Thus, the increased variant count obtained from Illumina in samples #27 and #59 reflected the presence of a larger pool of variants present at lower frequency levels.

Metagenomic approaches are increasingly used in the detection of novel viral pathogens but also to generate complete genomes of uncultivated viruses. In silico identification of complete viral genomes from sequence data would allow rapid phylogenetic characterization of these new viruses. Often, however, complete viral genomes are not recovered, but rather several distinct contigs derived from a single entity are, some of which have no sequence homology to any known proteins. De novo assembly of single viruses from a metagenome is challenging, not only because of the lack of a reference genome, but also because of intrapopulation variation and uneven or insufficient coverage. Here we explored different assembly algorithms, remote homology searches, genome-specific sequence motifs, kmer frequency ranking, and coverage profile binning to detect and obtain viral target genomes from metagenomes. All methods were tested on 454-generated sequencing datasets containing three recently described RNA viruses with a relatively large genome which were divergent to previously known viruses from the viral families Rhabdoviridae and Coronaviridae.

Indeed, G4s have been reported in several viruses, including those involved in recent epidemics, such as the Zika and Ebola viruses. Viral G4s are usually located in regulatory regions of the genome and implicated in the control of key viral processes; in some cases, they have been involved also in viral latency. In this context, G4 ligands have been developed and tested both as tools to study the complexity of G4-mediated mechanisms in the viral life cycle, and as therapeutic agents. In general, G4 ligands showed promising antiviral activity, with G4-mediated mechanisms of action both at the genome and transcript level. This review aims to provide an updated close-up of the literature on G4s in viruses.

Binding results and bioinformatics analyses confirmed that the epitopes of 5D-8.1 and 9D5 are distinct and located at the N-and C-terminal domains of VP1. Both antibodies are directed to conserved domains of a capsid protein of picornaviruses, and recognize the majority of EV types. However, they are not neutralizing, as expected for antibodies targeting conserved regions of the viral shell. Our data delineate the spectrum of EV types that each antibody binds to, thus confirming partial published results on the specificity of the two MAbs 18, 20, 24, 26 . Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the two antibodies cover EV types of the A species less well than those of the B, C, D species (Table 2 ). Since the binding spectra are not identical, the combined use of MAbs 5D-8.1 and 9D5 should allow to cover almost all EV types. Notably, both antibodies are also predicted to cover Rabovirus and Sapeloviruses, animal viruses of the most recent genera within the Picornaviridae family. Immunofluorescence results confirmed that MAb 5D-8.1 (but not 9D5) may produce fine granular fluorescence in the cytoplasm of uninfected human and monkey cells. This, however, occurred only at elevated antibody concentrations (i.e., > 1 μg/ml). The observation is in line with the lack of absolute specificity of EVs reported by Korsgren and collaborators 27 .

For example, no contigs were produced from the Coronaviridae family, though several pairs of reads were detected across distant genome regions. Several contigs of <430bp were designated as herpesvirus sequences, though were discarded after manual curation as being only mammalian-derived sequences. Some contigs were still identified as herpesvirus, though had poor evalue support. Severely fragmented viral genome coverage was observed for the Adenoviridae, with contigs aligning to multiple gene regions ranging in length from 200 to 1826bp (Fig 6A) . Estimation of adenovirus genome coverage is further complicated by the detection of divergent sequences that align to diverse adenovirus reference genomes. These limitations may be attributed to overall insufficient depth of sequencing, the bioinformatics analyses methods implemented (BLASTn), or biases incorporated by certain nucleic acid preparation techniques for library construction-such as the use of randomly primed cDNA [66, 67] .

Sequencing reads which mapped to the six targeted QRDR reference genes plotted against total number of genome copies, calculated from DNA input concentrations, demonstrated a sigmoidal dose-response with a linear range beginning around 1000 genome copies for each gene mapped (Fig. 3) . Often in pooled NGS runs dual-indexed sequencing reads will be misidentified during demultiplexing resulting in incorrect read mappings between samples known as sample bleeding 22, 23 . To account for misidentified reads, non-template controls were used to define a background and are termed throughout the paper as the ""cutoff "". The cutoff was determined as the average number of sequencing reads mapped to the reference gene in the non-template controls plus three times the standard deviation. Pearson coefficients demonstrated high degrees of correlation between target regions suggesting similar capture efficiencies (Supplementary Table S2 ). Total mapped reads composition, shown as a percentage of all mapped reads for each reference gene, indicated that decreases in total input DNA resulted in decreased correctly mapped reads (Fig. 3) . Above the cutoff of the assay 80% or more of the sequencing reads mapped correctly. Most of the sequencing reads at or below the cutoff remained unmapped for the reference targets (Supplementary Figure S1) . Indeed, at the cutoff, the low percentage (3%) of the total sequencing reads mapped to reference genes gradually increased to more than 90% of total reads at higher input concentrations (Supplementary Figure S1) . Analytical limit of detection (LOD); performance and confirmation. Capture of target genes demonstrated a preliminary cutoff for mapped reads above background levels in wild type cultures; however, the intended application of these probes was to detect ciprofloxacin resistance mutations. To test sequence coverage of the targeted genetic variants, we assessed strains with mutations known to confer resistance to ciprofloxacin 4 . Because WGA may incorporate bias 22 , these experiments used non-amplified whole genome extracted DNA to more accurately determine the assay LOD. Linear regression was utilized to fit data to a line and determine the point at which each genetic variant had 30X read coverage above the cutoff as determined by non-template controls 24 (Fig. 4) . This crossing point was determined to be the assay LOD. An LOD range was given for each genetic variant based on the standard error of the linear regression. In this context, each genetic variant fell within ranges of detection between 300 and 1200 input genome copies similar to the cutoff levels determined earlier. As demonstrated previously, the percentage of correctly assigned reads was between 80-100% at concentrations near or above the LOD (Fig. 4) .",23.24474957405205,10.178978689874572

We utilized transcript-based libraries because there is an amplification of protein-coding sequences during transcription, which increased our detection ability and provided support that the identified microorganisms were viable. Further, the database for protein-coding regions is more extensive than that for noncoding regions for non-reference organisms. Thus, focusing on transcripts should facilitate classification of novel organisms and those without complete genome coverage. Indeed, our study demonstrates that at the moderate sequencing depth employed, there were more assignable sequencing tags to protein-coding regions utilizing cDNA compared to genomic DNA, which consequently increased our ability to detect microbial taxa. In addition, transcriptome sequencing yields bacterial ribosomal RNA, which is highly expressed in metabolically active microorganisms and is well documented as a taxonomic tool for bacteria. Because single protein-coding or rRNA transcript-tags from a putative microorganism were frequently encountered, our confidence in taxonomic assignment increased by employing bioinformatics methods to classify organisms based on both types of transcripts. Amplicon 16S rRNA sequencing increased the sensitivity to detect members of some bacterial classes. However, primer specific methods do not provide as comprehensive a perspective on the microbiota due to a possible amplification bias towards more abundant taxa or those exhibiting higher primer specificity. Therefore, neither our metatranscriptomic nor amplicon sequencing approaches should be considered quantitative. We note that in samples that are highly enriched for actively replicating microbial organisms, such as environmental samples or gastrointestinal tract specimens, cDNA-based approaches can yield an abundance of small RNA produced by complex microbial communities, which can facilitate studies on microbial ecology but be less useful for identification of individual microbes [49] . In addition established metagenomics or metatranscriptomic [11, 50, 51] approaches that utilize sample fractionation methods for microbial enrichment will likely provide a more comprehensive profile of the community structure. These methods were not applicable to our samples, which included phagocytized microorganisms and viable microbes that were not robustly proliferating.

For example, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) results from infection by one of many possible Picornaviruses, and research has demonstrated that each of these viruses elicits a unique systemic miRNA response that enables differentiation of the potential causative agents [17] . Thus, it would be of interest to elucidate the signature miRNA response for FMDV infection, which may be applicable across all serotypes of FMDV or could be different with each of the seven known serotypes and in different host organisms such as goats, sheep, and pigs. Similarly, identification of distinct changes in circulating miRNAs potentially associated with subclinical persistence of FMDV could be of great value for development of novel diagnostic approaches for disease surveillance. Furthermore, some of the miRNAs detected in this study might also serendipitously target regions of the FMDV genome, and could be potentially adapted as biotherapeutic against FMDV similar to recent report with miR-203a-3p and miR-203a-5p [53] . To briefly explore that possibility, a bioinformatics analysis was conducted using two miRNA recognition sequence mapping algorithms (miRmap and ViTa) [54, 55] , where the sequence for the FMDV isolate used in this study was input (A24 Cruzeiro, Accession #AY593768) along with each individual miRNA identified herein (see Additional file 3: Table S2 ).

The method relies on the recombinase-dependent insertion of a single-stranded invasion oligonucleotide (IO) into a complementary region of a target duplex DNA, which results in the dissociation of the target duplex. This dissociation event generates single-stranded DNA, which in turn allows targetspecific primers to bind and extend the target sequence via the action of a DNA polymerase. The method was previously found to be useful for the rapid detection of DNA from pathogens (Hoser et al. 2014) . In this study, we describe the development of a variant of SIBA technology, namely, reverse transcription SIBA (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of viral RNA targets. We demonstrate the efficacy of RT-SIBA in the detection of viral RNA by developing RT-SIBA assays for both influenza A and B. The assays were designed to detect sequences within conserved regions of the influenza genome. The RT-SIBA method includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows a one-step reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA and simultaneous amplification and detection of the cDNA with SIBA under isothermal reaction conditions.

Sauder et al. performed serial passaging of the strain Urabe AM9 in cell cultures and compared the whole nucleotide sequences of the parental (Urabe P-AM9) and passaged viruses (Urabe P6-Vero or Urabe P6-CEF) to investigate the attenuation process and to identify the attenuation markers [123] . Passaging of the Urabe AM9 mumps virus in Vero or chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell lines caused changes in the genetic heterogeneity at particular regions of the genome through either changing of one nucleotide at locations where the starting material showed nucleotide heterogeneity or the presentation of an additional nucleotide to produce a heterogenic site. Virulence of the passaged virus was dramatically decreased in the murine model. Moreover, similar growth kinetics of the virulent Urabe P-AM9 and passaged attenuated variants in the rat brain suggested that the impaired replication ability of the attenuated variants was not the main cause of the neuroattenuation. However, in the rat brain, the peak titer of the neuroattenuated variant was almost one log lower than that of the neurovirulent parental strain. For instance, identical but independent induction of heterogeneity at position 370 of the F-gene by substitution of threonine to alanine in passaged virus in Vero and CEF cells suggested a correlation of this mutation to the neuroattenuation phenotype. There was lack of ability to identify heterogeneity for those regions with differences of more than 10% between the detected nucleotides in the consensus sequence. The heterogeneity could be the result of new mutations at these positions or the selection of pre-existing sequences within the minority quasispecies. In addition, passaging of the parental strain in CEF and Vero cells led to the observation of several amino acid alterations in the NP, P, F, HN and L proteins that could affect the virulence of the virus. Thus, the modifications of genetic heterogeneity at particular genome sites could have important consequences on the neurovirulence phenotype. Therefore, extra caution should be exercised in order to evaluate genetic markers of virulence or attenuation of variants based on only a consensus sequence [123] .",19.208227955149408,9.090707593159257

After dephosphorylation, the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA designed for both ends of the target region are applied to cut the target region. The Nanopore sequencing adapters are specifically ligated to the 5′ phosphate of the target DNA generated by Cas9. Gilpatrick et al. applied nCAT to ten loci of~18 kb in length from three human cell lines and obtained a median coverage of 165X at the ten loci from a MinION flowcell.

With the development of the highthroughput sequencing of PCR products, which is highly sensitive, specific and relatively low cost, it has become more common in the medical and forensic fields to sequence the whole mitochondrial genome [1] . As a result, more rapid sequencing using microarrays-based resequencing is being used increasingly in clinical and research laboratories for identifying mutations throughout the entire mtDNA genome. Resequencing microarrays are a promising technology for diagnostic mitochondrial disorders and related diseases based on changes at the genetics level [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, validation of output data particularly for mtDNA, i.e., the accuracy of base identification (or call) for homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations, as well as detection insertions or deletions (indels) from these microarrays-based resequencing chips has been a major issue [2, 6, 7] .",22.96656553815714,11.99614545012334

The whole human genome seems to encode 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes, and certain mutations will lead to dysfunctional proteins which may give rise to diseases. Therefore, to find some new method of mutation assay which can simultaneously identify all these types of variations is most desirable. Mutation detection is usually focused on very specific sequencing, or mini-sequencing, of a particular gene locus, such as a singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Oligonucleotide probes provide a useful tool for the detection of target nucleic acids through the formation of a double-helical structure between complementary sequences. However, hydrogen bonds between target and probe hybrids are inherently weaker than covalent bonds, thus, making it more susceptible to breakage during stringent washes. To overcome this problem, Nilsson et al. [2] synthesized a circularizable oligonucleotide probe (C-probe) for in situ target localization and detection. On a target DNA, the two ends of the probe become juxtaposed and can be joined by DNA ligase. The C-probe was introduced to detect a mutation in a target because even a single nucleotide change in the target prevents ligation. The utility of circularizable oligonucleotides probe had been demonstrated for the detection of target nucleic acid sequences. This approach shows greater sensitivity than conventional PCR [3, 4] . Several methods [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] have been designed to improve the detection sensitivity by amplifying the closed C-probe. The initial strategy was introduced to amplify the closed C-probe by the rolling circle amplification (RCA) mechanism as observed in in vivo bacteriophage replication [7] . This type of amplification, however, only results in linear growth of the products with several thousand-fold amplifications.",18.72641372036056,9.97997523320606

Whereas such tasks are not trivial, I expect that with alignment of academic and industry interests in this field, the technical capacities of rapid sequencing devices will continue to evolve with measurable improvements in fidelity, resolution, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness within the next 5 years (20, 21) . Such advancements hold the potential to change diagnostic paradigms not only for pulmonary infections but also for several infectious diseases where culture-based diagnostic approaches are currently being used (16) (17) (18) . None-theless, from a clinical translation standpoint, the question remains: how can we move from sequencing outputs to a clinically actionable test result? This is a formidable challenge, not unique to critical care or pulmonary infections: diagnostic performance in the absence of a gold standard, or rather, in the presence of a standard of care that is not golden (22) . Metagenomic sequencing directly from patient samples can comprehensively detect viable, dead, or fastidious bacteria, whereas clinical microbiologic cultures can effectively grow only the subset of cultivable bacteria that have not been inhibited or killed by antecedent antibiotic administration. Given that metagenomics is a far more sensitive technology, conventional sensitivity/specificity analyses contrasting metagenomics with cultures are meaningless (Fig. 1B) . At the same time, this ""ultrasensitivity"" of metagenomics can create reporting problems, as the detection of commensal communities or bacteria not typically considered pathogenic will require contextspecific interpretation of their ""pathogenicity"" or lack thereof.

Despite control efforts involving improved biosecurity and different vaccination protocols, the virus continues to circulate and evolve. One of the foremost challenges in its control is high levels of genetic and antigenic diversity. Here, we quantify the co-circulation, emergence and sequential turnover of multiple PRRSV lineages in a single swine-producing region in the United States over a span of 9 years (2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017). By classifying over 4,000 PRRSV sequences (open-reading frame 5) into phylogenetic lineages and sub-lineages, we document the ongoing diversification and temporal dynamics of the PRRSV population, including the rapid emergence of a novel sub-lineage that appeared to be absent globally pre-2008. In addition, lineage 9 was the most prevalent lineage from 2009 to 2010, but its occurrence fell to 0.5% of all sequences identified per year after 2014, coinciding with the emergence or re-emergence of lineage 1 as the dominant lineage. The sequential dominance of different lineages, as well as three different sublineages within lineage 1, is consistent with the immune-mediated selection hypothesis for the sequential turnover in the dominant lineage. As host populations build immunity through natural infection or vaccination toward the most common variant, this dominant (sub-) lineage may be replaced by an emerging variant to which the population is more susceptible. An analysis of patterns of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations revealed evidence of positive selection on immunologically important regions of the genome, further supporting the potential that immune-mediated selection shapes the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics for this virus. This has important implications for patterns of emergence and re-emergence of genetic variants of PRRSV that have negative impacts on the swine industry. Constant surveillance on PRRSV occurrence is crucial to a better understanding of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of co-circulating viral lineages. Further studies utilizing whole genome sequencing and exploring the extent of cross-immunity between heterologous PRRS viruses could shed further light on PRRSV immunological response and aid in developing strategies that might be able to diminish disease impact.",17.46035036388124,8.974799091916081

Although the most common targets are the ribosomal DNA genes (i.e., 16S for bacteria and 18S for fungi), several housekeeping genes (i.e., tufB, rplB, valsS, and rpoB) are also useful for the identification of pathogens [10, 11, 29] . Within these genes, highly conserved regions are used as priming sites, but the region amplified contains enough variability for the discrimination between species. For instance, in order to identify bacterial and Candida species, the BAC assay includes thirteen pairs of primers targeting different conserved regions (nine primers pairs for bacteria and four for Candida species). An advantage of using PCR primers designed for several conserved regions with varying degrees of specificity is that when more than one microorganism is present, there is redundancy of coverage across various primer pairs. This is especially relevant when the different microorganisms are present in different abundances, as using several nonoverlapping primer pairs may allow amplification of the less abundant species.

This was done using DENV1, a positive single stranded RNA virus lacking a poly(A) tail. The protocol used to generate the pre-capture group sequencing results employ the second strategy while that for the post-capture and concentrated post-capture results employ the third. The polyadenylation of RNA and subsequent use of the conventional poly(T) adapter has several advantages. First, the polyadenylation of RNA prior to library preparation and sequencing allows for sequencing of RNA viruses with or without an inherent poly(A) tail. Second, usage of the conventional poly(T) adapter removes the need for any foreknowledge of the target sequence. Third, all RNA fragments would be ligated with adapters since the adapters are not sequence specific, circumventing the problem of fragmented RNA. However, the main disadvantage strategies involving polyadenylation of RNA is that sequencing specificity is greatly reduced as host mRNA transcripts include a poly(A) tail and will also be sequenced. Wongsurawat et al. (2019) independently replicated our pre-capture group results but with ZIKV, which is also a positive single stranded RNA virus lacking a poly(A) tail in the family Flaviviridae. The authors observed 0.11% of reads mapping to ZIKV, which corroborates the low 0.63% of reads mapping to DENV1 in our pre-capture sequencing run. The authors also reported 3.89% of reads mapping to ZIKV whilst employing the fourth strategy. The low percentage of target reads underscores this main disadvantage of sequencing specificity. The issue of low sequencing specificity is, however, less pronounced in the third strategy. Comparing the second strategy (pre-capture) and third strategy (post-capture), there is a 50-fold increase in percentage of reads mapping to DENV1. Furthermore, a comparison of pre-capture and concentrated post-capture results yields a 123-fold increase in mapping rates to DENV1. This suggests that while simply polyadenylating RNA samples leads to low sequencing specificity, applying our capture-based purification prior allows us to reap the advantages of using the conventional poly(T) adapter whilst having a significantly higher sequence specificity. Additionally, coupling capture-based purification with polyadenylation yields a higher target mapping rate of 31.31% with regard to the 3.98% observed when the fourth strategy was employed (Wongsurawat et al. 2019) . This suggests that the third strategy is superior with respect to sequencing specificity when compared to the fourth strategy. It is noted, however, that the sequencing specificity of the third strategy was still lower than that of the first strategy. Moreover, applying capture-based purification in the third strategy significantly increases the turnaround time as compared to the first, second and fourth strategy. Therefore, it is suggested that the third strategy should only be employed where foreknowledge of the viral sequence at hand is limited, or where RNA integrity is low. It is also suggested that the second and fourth strategy be used in cases where detection rather than characterisation of RNA viruses is required due to significantly lower sequencing specificity.",17.47299840702832,9.384952566315503

In each of these viruses, small ORFs of various lengths occur within most transcriptional units; and although only those 180 nt have Genomic Evolution in Rhabdoviruses been catalogued here, there are numerous other smaller ORFs throughout most genomes. It is reasonable to assume that, although the polypeptides encoded in many of these ORFs may not be expressed at all during infection, some may be expressed through leaky ribosomal scanning. These are likely to represent a rich genetic resource for the evolution of new functional genes in RNA viruses [4] , triggering the rapid evolution of highly specialised functions. Contemporarily, the evolution of a suitable Kozak context, TURBS motifs and ribosomal frame-shift sites would allow optimal expression within the parental transcriptional unit. Ultimately, these new ORFs may become uncoupled from the parental gene through gene (sequence) duplication [18] . As observed previously, this process would allow unconstrained evolution of the new ORF and loss of the redundant copy of the parental ORF [4, 64] . Alternatively, new genes may also evolve independently of existing ORFs. In some rhabdoviruses in our data set, very long non-coding regions (up to 749 nt) were present either within or between transcriptional units that could serve as a resource to spawn genes de novo in the absence of the evolutionary constraints imposed on alternative or overlapping ORFs. This is most likely to occur when ORFs are present in transcribed non-coding regions (UTRs) such as the ψ region of WCBV in which, uniquely amongst lyssaviruses, an ORF of 180 nt has been identified [65] . The creation of new genes de novo in non-transcribed IGRs, such as those present in the G-L gene junctions of LJV, KOTV and KOOLV, almost certainly would require prior or simultaneous evolution of new or modified transcriptional control sequences to allow their expression.",15.44060041860498,8.920758941019724

The Northern blot assay demonstrated the presence of similar amounts of full-length viral genome in P5 high and P2 low (Fig. 3 , top band) with an additional band of approximately 7 kb detected in both virus stocks. The identity of the 7 kb fragment is unknown. In addition to these large RNA molecules, smaller RNAs ranging in size from 0.5 to 4 kb were detected but only in P5 high . As the RNA was analysed on denaturing gels, fragments of this size may represent DIs, double-stranded in nature, of 0.25-2 kb. Quantification using a ChemiDoc Imaging system indicated that 80 % of the total RNA, in the size range 0.5-4 kb for P5 high , was probably of DI origin.",17.46094918176184,8.618699088430677

We therefore altered the original poliovirus type 1 sub-genomic replicon (pRLucWT) to inactivate the native CRE in the 2C coding region by the introduction of 8 synonymous substitutions (identical to those used in the construction of the SL3 variants used here and previously; (13) ) to generate pRLucWT CRE. We confirmed that, as expected, RNA synthesized in vitro from pRLucWT CRE and transfected into murine L929 cells could not replicate (Figure 2A ). The luciferase signal generated was similar in the presence or absence of 4 mM guanidine hydrochloride, a potent inhibitor of poliovirus replication (28), indicating it was solely from translation of the transfected RNA. We subsequently engineered a synthetic variant of the CRE sequence into the 3 NCR of a pRLucWT CRE to generate pRLucWT CRE 3 CRE. The synthetic CRE sequence used had previously been shown to function when inserted into the 5 NCR and consisted of the terminal 18 nt. of the wild-type CRE sequence engineered to form the terminal loop on a stem with similar structural stability to the native element (Supplementary Figure S1 ). This sequence was known to be stable in genomes bearing dual CRE sequences (21) . RNA generated in vitro from pRLucWT CRE 3 CRE was transfected into murine L929 cells and luciferase synthesis monitored for 8 hours post-transfection. In parallel assays the luciferase signal from pRLucWT CRE 3 CRE-derived RNA was marginally greater than that from RNA generated from the parental sub-genomic replicon, pRLucWT, confirming that insertion of the CRE within the 3 NCR was not incompatible with genome replication (Figure 2A) .",15.903169702765027,8.220119179235734

The main advantage of this procedure is to select aptamers, as nucleic acid-based affinity ligands, without any prior knowledge of the target. One of the modified SELEX procedures is the Cell-SELEX, which is used to discover specific aptamers against a whole cell (Fig. 1) . In other words, cells are considered as the target in selection process [24] . An oligonucleotide library consists of 10 12 to 10 16 distinct sequences. The random region of library is usually 40-100 bases long, flanked by constant primer sequences at both ends, facilitating PCR amplification [25] . The separation of the target-bound sequences from unbound ones via an affinity-based partitioning method and the amplification of the bound sequences by PCR are the important phases of SELEX method. Then, amplified sequences are converted into single strand forms and single stranded oligonucleotides enter the next cycle of SELEX, same as the previous round. The selection cycles are repeated several times to achieve high-affinity sequences in an enriched pool. The identity of DNA pool individuals is determined by cloning and then, sequencing [26] or by next generation sequencing techniques [27] . Several negative selection cycles are developed through a SELEX process to reduce the nonspecific bound oligonucleotides, to enhance the specificity of evolved pool. This type of SELEX has been extensively applied to develop aptamers against bacteria or other pathogenic cells. Low diversity of the DNA library sequence, PCR reagent contamination, contamination of the eluted sequences from the target cells, strong non-specific binding, low frequency of target molecules on the cells and the change in a cellular state can affect negatively the enrichment of the aptamer sequences [28] .",15.58697795047074,8.180205652225

Sequence analysis (MLVA), etc., and the emerging high-resolution WGS technology guarantee the accurate traceability and monitoring of infectious diseases and can also complement each other with multiple molecular technologies to improve the accuracy of detection. WGS technology can track the prevalence of pathogens and more accurately identify possible sources of pathogens [40, 41] . And with the continuous development of this technology, the current traceability and monitoring capabilities for unknown pathogens are becoming more and more prominent. e pathogens of severe pulmonary infection are usually unclear. Currently, the clinical use of antigen/antibody immunology methods and traditional microbial culture techniques is used for diagnosis.

In particular, patients with tracheal intubation are measured by sputum extraction from the lower respiratory tract of the bronchus, which can more accurately provide pathogenic bacteria analysis of ventilator-associated pneumonia, further guiding clinical treatment and prognosis. With the development of second-generation sequencing technology, processing and sequencing time will be further reduced. e SGS method will eventually provide clinicians with rapid, accurate, independent culture-based identification of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity characteristics [42] .",15.975274082046274,7.492097585010065

Viral surface proteins can be modified to express ligands that bind to receptors preferentially or exclusively expressed on tumor cells. Viruses can be genetically adapted to express those modifications to redirect them towards tumor cells (Figures 1(a) and 1(b) ). The main advantage of this strategy is that the targeting specificity is inherent to the viral genome and will, thus, be maintained upon replication. Progeny virus is then able to infect neighboring cells harboring the target receptor, thereby establishing a multiround infection that will be maintained until no further tumor target cells remain. For this strategy, the ability to genetically modify the viral genome is crucial. Furthermore, detailed structural information about the viral surface protein to be modified is indispensible to predict at which location targeting motifs might be tolerated and will be exposed. Such motifs should not only allow binding of the modified virion to the cells but should also not be detrimental to the entry mechanism of the particular virus, not interfering for instance with the fusion of viral and cellular membrane. In addition, the targeting ligand introduced into the viral protein will have to meet size limitations. Small peptides, thus, seem the first and most obvious choice. The development of targeting strategies of viruses is, however, severely limited by a shortage of naturally existing molecules available for use as targeting ligands. Therefore, other sources of binding ligands have been investigated and incorporated into viral proteins for this purpose. These include (parts of) antibodies, like scFvs (single-chain variable fragments, composed of a fusion of the variable regions of the heavy (V H ) and light chains (V L ) of an immunoglobulin) or Fabs (antigen-binding fragments, composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody).

This implies that despite its high fidelity, the assay is able to tolerate slight differences in target sequence. This is in agreement with Boyle et al. 33 , who reported that two different HIV-1 RPA primer-probe sets were capable of amplifying nearly all HIV-1 subtypes, including one isolate with 9 mismatches. In our report, GII.4 Sydney containing 6 total mismatches in the target region was readily amplified. The data of Daher et al. 34 , which focused on using RPA for amplification of conserved genes for several bacteria, showed a similar tolerance to base pair mismatches. Interestingly, the GII.3 template was inconsistently amplified by the NOF5-NOR11-NOP1 primer-probe set, the amplified region of which contained base mismatches on the 3′ end of NOF5 and NOR11 target regions in addition to a large number of mismatches (Table 4 ). Such placement of mismatches was found by Daher et al. 34 to be more inhibitory to amplification than internal or 5′ mismatches. The fact that the primer-probe set reported here did not amplify any other relevant enteric virus or bacterial nucleic acid suggests that it shows good specificity, reducing the likelihood of false positives. However, future studies building upon the foundational work presented here analyzing a larger number and diversity of human norovirus clinical samples must be completed to validate and evaluate the suitability of this assay for large scale clinical settings. For instance, analysis of the Table 4 . Sequence alignment of GII.4 strains and GII.3. The sequences of GII.4 New Orleans and Sydney strains as well as a GII.3 strain were aligned using the Mega 6 software package. Bolded sequences correspond to the NOF5 and NOR11 target sequence regions, with base mismatches for Sydney and GII.3 colored red. Probe target regions were excluded because there were 0 and 3 mismatches with New Orleans as compared to Sydney and GII.3, respectively. assay's reactivity with earlier strains of the GII.4 genotype and reactivity with the GII.17 genotype that is emerging as a genotype of significance 35 would be valuable future work. Another logical future direction to build on this work would be to design and optimize more degenerate primer-probe sets and potentially multiplex the assay for immediate genogrouping analysis. This is the first report on the use of the emerging RPA technology for the rapid detection of human norovirus. RT-RPA has multiple advantages over RT-qPCR, including: (i.) the lack of reliance on larger, more expensive equipment for amplification and detection; (ii.) the use of recombinase enzymes that reduce the likelihood of false positive results due to their inherent proofreading capabilities 6, 7, 36 ; (iii.) quicker time-to-result; and (iv) the potential for reduced impact of matrix-associated inhibitors. Theoretically, the RT-RPA assay is capable of direct, portable detection of epidemic human norovirus in clinical samples with minimal expertise in less than 30 minutes. With further optimization, in particular improvement of analytical sensitivity and comprehensive evaluation of assay specificity, RT-RPA has potential to be a promising alternative to RT-qPCR or other isothermal methods for rapid testing for human norovirus.

While this technique worked relatively well for analyzing short stretches of DNA or RNA (i.e., up to 2 kb), the technique had limitations that made it cumbersome for analysis of larger gene regions. For example, we could only analyze individual amplicons of approximately 600-800 bp due to the inherent loss of size resolution in larger fragments. We also needed to include a sequencing ladder in each electrophoretic analysis to obtain accurate fragment size information. Because our mapping fragments had short transposon-derived sequences appended to the 39 end, fragment sizing with the sequencing ladder was not exact. We theorized that functional mapping by using massively parallel sequencing might overcome some of these issues. In principle, the large number of sequencing reads obtained would allow us to measure the relative frequencies of insertions at each nucleotide position in the genome. Massively parallel sequencing would also provide an exact sequence readout of the locations of inserts and generate highly accurate maps. Lastly, mapping by For our studies, we used a Roche GS-FLX system, which was adequate for mapping the approximately 11.5 kb VEEV genome (,100 K-200 K reads per sample.) Viruses with larger genomes could be mapped by using other sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer or Applied Biosystems SOLiD sequencer. These platforms produce hundreds of millions of sequencing reads, and would permit the analysis of a much larger number of samples per sequencing run. Therefore, they are probably the optimal systems for this type of analysis. Although the length of sequencing reads obtained on these systems are shorter than those obtained on the GS-FLX, the 35+ bp reads that they generate should be enough to map insertion sites onto the relatively simple genomes of viruses. In our analysis of VEEV, we found that the first 20 nts of sequence was sufficient for mapping each read back to the genome.",17.187752150880154,7.48451259651323

(2016) sequenced unamplified poly(A)-tailed viral RNA using a rapid cDNA library preparation coupled with realtime data analysis to determine its potential application for pathogen genomic characterization. This approach for pathogen identification and characterization differs from the previously used methods on the MinION platform (Hoenen et al., 2016) . Biased techniques, such as amplicon sequencing, have proven to be effective in complex sample backgrounds in which titers of the target pathogen might be low, but such approaches limit characterization to known pathogens and require additional viral genome amplification (Wang et al., 2015; Quick et al., 2016) . The great potential of the use of a RNA/cDNA hybrid approach in field studies has been confirmed in western Africa (Hoenen et al., 2016; Quick et al., 2016) . Generally, high virus titers in clinical samples are necessary for virus detection before genome sequencing, hence utilizing an RNA/cDNA hybrid approach for genomic ZIKV characterization could be a feasible strategy, especially for genomic library preparation and for reducing the time required for strain-level identification (Faria et al., 2016) .",19.80276885664811,11.10801748497012

We obtained full genome sequence coverage from as few as an estimated 20,000 starting copies (4) and found that relatively uniform whole viral genome coverage can be achieved with 100,000 paired-end reads, suggesting that many samples could be sequenced in a single MiSeq run. Whole-genome viral sequencing from clinical samples should be both technically and economically feasible, permitting investigators to avoid the use of laboratoryadapted strains of virus in immortalized cultured cell lines. The deep genome-wide screens of paired clinical samples and viral isolates allow for simple, rapid interrogation of viral evolution in the context of multiple clinical strain backgrounds. The methods pursued here allowed for discovery of novel HN residues of interest that heretofore had not been identified based on consensus sequence. Deep sequencing after rapid selection pressure may allow for discovery of a greater number of novel mutations that may be removed from the population by drift or competition with other variant subpopulations after longer selection periods yet provide clues to function. Other techniques that can more comprehensively profile single mutations, such as deep mutational scanning, are often limited by their use of singular backgrounds, often in the context of culture-adapted strains, and focus on singular proteins.",22.622978278623766,10.807894885559241

The situation is aggravated by the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the risk that terrorists might use infectious organisms to aggress target populations. During the past decade, we have also witnessed the emergence of many new pathogens not previously detected in humans, such as the avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola. The appearance of these novel agents and the reemergence of previously eradicated pathogens may be associated with the growing human population, flooding, and other environmental perturbations; global travel and migration; and animal trade and domestic animal husbandry practices. Simultaneously, we have seen an explosion of genome sequence data. Sequencing is now the method of choice for characterization of new disease agents, as exemplified by the rapid sequencing of the genome of the SARS virus, which was made available within a month of identification of the virus [2, 3] .

First, they served as a mechanism of error checking, as each read pair came from the same template and should therefore be perfectly complementary. Base calls that do not match in the forward and reverse strands are automatically identified as sequencing errors. Second, although the mismatched bases were excluded from data analysis, they provided an empirical estimate for single-read sequencing error rates. Third, it identified ""problematic loci"" on the genome where large fractions of the ORPs are mismatched. A high fraction of ORP mismatches at a particular locus would indicate that the locus was a site with high probability of erroneous nucleotide incorporation and hence suggest that a more stringent criterion should be considered when making variant calls at the locus.",21.311598446034353,10.123446479560966

Both Duplex Sequencing [32] and Safe-SeqS [31] require labeling the DNA fragment libraries with unique sequence tags (UID) prior to PCR amplification. Post-sequencing, mutations that occur in the majority of their uniquely tagged read families are identified as true variants. These methods successfully address the errors introduced during PCR and sequencing but are subject to the efficiency of the UID assignment. A significant fraction of the starting material is generally lost in the library prep procedures for Illumina sequencing due to poor adapter ligation efficiency and the requirement of multiple clean-up cycles. If a sample contains limited starting material for sequencing, as is often the case in viral or clinical samples, performing adapter ligation prior to PCR amplification will likely lead to poor representation of the sample. Furthermore, the additional UID assignment process adds to the complexity and cost of sample preparation. Thus while these methods present a possible approach for the future, their scalability to whole genome sequencing has not yet been demonstrated. Flaherty et al. [15] proposed an ultrasensitive mutation detection method for targeted resequencing using a position-specific error profile. They derive the positionspecific error profile of a 700 bp region of the NA gene in H1N1 using a clone of the sample of interest. This approach while highly specific, also does not scale to whole genome analysis. In contrast to these methods, we suggest that the use of ORPs to derive error profiles is easily extendible to a genome of any size without the use of a cloned sample. Comparable fragment length and read length is the only requirement to generate ORPs.",19.14433022519281,9.691402344535943

In particular, deep sequencing has been used to identify medically relevant drug-resistant rare variants that impact anti-retroviral drug treatment outcomes [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Many of the earliest efforts have targeted specific hyper variable genomic regions using 454 sequencing; more recently published studies have begun to target more of the genome with high depths using the greater sequencing output of Illumina technologies [16, 17] . Recently, the software tool for managing deep sequencing data, Segminator II, was introduced and used to compare performance of Illumina and 454 deep sequencing of influenza [18] . However, less emphasis was given to evaluating a general subconsensus base calling procedure and the impact of PCR amplification was not considered. Two other available packages that address PCR errors and known sequencing error modes, AmpliconNoise [19] and RC454 [20] , are designed specifically for 454 pyrosequencing data. In a recent Illumina deep sequencing study of foot-and-mouth disease virus samples, Wright et al. [21] counted evidence for between 1,434 and 2,622 rare variants present in their samples. Their approach relied on an estimated error rate from the sequencer without the use of sequencing controls and included sequencing each sample twice to correct for sequencing error, which would present practical problems for sequencing larger numbers of samples collected from an outbreak.

Therefore, accurate and efficient gene prediction programs are highly desired for rapid and cost effective surveillance of RNA viruses through full genome sequencing. Results: We have developed VIGOR (Viral Genome ORF Reader), a web application tool for gene prediction in influenza virus, rotavirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus subtypes. VIGOR detects protein coding regions based on sequence similarity searches and can accurately detect genome specific features such as frame shifts, overlapping genes, embedded genes, and can predict mature peptides within the context of a single polypeptide open reading frame. Genotyping capability for influenza and rotavirus is built into the program. We compared VIGOR to previously described gene prediction programs, ZCURVE_V, GeneMarkS and FLAN. The specificity and sensitivity of VIGOR are greater than 99% for the RNA viral genomes tested. Conclusions: VIGOR is a user friendly web-based genome annotation program for five different viral agents, influenza, rotavirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and SARS coronavirus. This is the first gene prediction program for rotavirus and rhinovirus for public access.

The mouse genome is the same in these respects. Similarly, very few oligos less than 13 bp are unique in the human genome, but the vast majority of oligos of length greater than 19, except repeat elements, are unique in the human genome. This is consistent with practical experience in the design of primers for PCR. Some of the most frequent n-mers in the human genome are microsatellites and ALU elements, as would be expected (Table 2 ). These ultra-frequent n-mers should be useful as high density markers in the genome and as primers for assays such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [18] in which a large number of regions of the genome may be amplified in a single PCR reaction.

The basis of this approach includes amplification of the region of interest, followed by cloning of the amplicons into a plasmid vector and transformation of bacteria. Then, the transformed bacteria are plated. The bacteria are assumed to carry only one plasmid, and the presence of only one viral variant sequence is confirmed by colony PCR and sequencing. Thus, DNA from an individual bacterial colony represents the sequence of a single variant. Unfortunately, sampling is a major issue for this particular approach because even in large studies that analyze hundreds of clones, only a small fraction of the viral population and genome is sampled [173] . Moreover, the exact number of clones necessary to achieve a given level of confidence depends on the frequency of each incorrect nucleotide at any given nucleotide position in the sequence [184] . It has been suggested that between 20 and 100 clones per sample are required for frequency and entropy analyses. Sequencing 99 clones has been proposed to identify 95% of all variants present at a frequency of at least 3% in the population [185] . However, others have suggested that sequencing 20 clones is sufficient to cover 95% of the major variants (frequency >10% in the population). Regardless of the estimate, under these circumstances, most minor variants go undetected, significantly hampering our capacity to untangle the mechanisms involved in HCV evolution. Recent advances in single genome sequencing have improved our understanding of HCV transmission [101] . In summary, regardless of the number of clones analyzed, the depth with which population sequencing can assess the complexity of the HCV intrahost population is extremely limited.",19.018566519575362,8.5074487315565

For HCV, the increasing number of viral sequences available in public and private databases has promoted the development of novel ways to analyze considerably large data sets [211, 212] . Relatively recent technological innovations have ignited an explosion in virus genome sequencing that is likely to help us understand the intimate details of HCV biology and its impact on public health. Nonetheless, any benefits derived from the generation of massive sequence data are hindered by the implementation of resources capable of identifying the sequences, as well as assembling, annotating, curating, maintaining and storing extremely large databases [117, 211, 212] . Importantly, virology has recently drawn the interest of the bioinformatics community, which in turn has led to the development of a variety of tools. This rapid expansion of the HCV sequence universe has forced a recalibration of the data model to better provide extant sequence representation and enhanced reference sequence products to serve the needs of the various viral communities [211] [212] [213] . However, despite the growth in viral bioinformatics, a number of questions remain unanswered, including but not restricted to identification, genome annotation, phylogeny, evolution, and genetic diversity. Viral evolution has many implications for clinical virology. The emergence of HCV resistance mutations is one of the most important challenges for successful antiviral therapy [214] . The molecular mechanisms selecting resistance mutations are complex; therefore, new bioinformatics approaches to characterize HCV evolution both at an intra-and interhost level are required.

The size of these gaps can be approximated by comparison with a reference genome or, alternatively, may be crossed using paired-end (or mate-paired) libraries. Here, larger fragments of DNA are first purified (e.g. 2-8 kb), adapters are added on either end and the molecule is circularized. This brings two regions of the genome, previously separated by several thousands of bases, into close contact, separated by the adapters. These circular DNA molecules are fragmented and sequenced in the usual way. This not only allows the original ends of the molecule to be sequenced, but crucially also identifies their relative position and separation in the genome. Sequence from paired-end libraries can be built informatically into genome 'scaffolds', showing the order and relative positions of individual contigs, thereby facilitating genome closure.

Another limitation concerned the molecular methods used for typing HAdVs in this study, a method which targeted a short hexon hypervariable region that has been shown to correlate closely with serotype. This method does not provide genomic detail and might miss recombination events located in other regions of the genome.

Specificity was achieved by targeting regions that do not appear to be similar to any other organisms, determined by searching a database of known genome sequences. Primer candidates were selected based on the combined results of the MSA and sequence searches. This technique is a modified version of the approach outlined in Slezak et. al.

For rabies virus, which lacks perfect primer-length conservation around the genomic regions of interest, it was necessary to identify degenerate primers for many non-conserved primer regions.

Here, we present a robust SOP for generating high-quality, barcoded cDNAs directly from genomic RNA across multiple virus families. Families represented include Picornaviridae, Alphaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Coronaviridae, which have genome sizes from~7 kb to 28 kb. The strategy builds upon established sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) methods (13) (14) (15) . Our data prove that barcoded NGS sequencing libraries can be rapidly generated while simultaneously destroying both viral particle and genomic RNA infectivity. Our approach is scalable, highly adaptable, and sensitive. The SOP generates high-quality sequences spanning the entire genome, up to 288 pooled barcoded samples can be examined in a single NGS run, and the products of the SOP work on multiple NGS platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, HiSeq, NextSeq, and Ion Torrent). The SOP works on starting material of purified virus, tissue culture samples, or tissue samples. We are able to detect virus-specific reads in samples where the input is fewer than 10 PFU and can identify viruses present in an unknown sample. Therefore, this application has potential for rapid sequencing of high-titer viral stocks as well as virus discovery and/or forensics. Finally, the nonspecific nature of the amplification makes this SOP adaptable to negative-strand RNA viruses (ssRNAϪ), double-strand RNA (dsRNA), single-strand DNA (ssDNA), or double-strand DNA (dsDNA) viruses.",16.033066683805902,10.181712735522709

The TGC-NGS approach could also be modified for specific research or clinical applications. For example, the number of probes per target pathogen could be increased if the goal is to investigate genetic diversity or rare genetic variants among a small set of pathogens. This may improve the capture efficiency and sequencing depth for each pathogen, enabling analyses into, for example, molecular evolution and intrahost diversity. Alternatively, by targeting only conserved regions of pathogens, instead of full-length genomes, more target pathogens could be included in a single capture probe library, as suggested by others (4).

Compared to sequencing, microarray analysis has the disadvantage that probes designed from known sequences are unlikely to detect truly novel organisms lacking homology to those sequences. However, microbial genomes are difficult and time-consuming to characterize when they have no similarity to known sequences, so the ability of sequencing to identify novel genomes has limited practical benefit in a rapid diagnostic context. Microbial detection arrays provide an assessment of known pathogens complementary to that provided by a functional gene array, such as the array to detect virulence and antibiotic resistance gene families described in [2] .

A variety of possible strategies exist to enhance the sensitivity of HTS for virus detection and characterization, including purification of specific viral fractions by physical methods such as filtration and ultracentrifugation [2] , amplicon-based target enrichment, and hybridization-based target enrichment. Purification of viral fractions is ideal in some cases, although it can be laborious, and for certain sized samples (for instance clinical samples of very limited volume) it may not be realistic. The use of hybridization-based target enrichment could be preferable to the aforementioned technologies because it has the potential to yield sequence data covering the entire genome of multiple viruses with just one sequencing reaction by using genome-wide probes designed against multiple viruses to specifically select for viral cDNA prior to sequencing. Amplicon sequencing of viral genomes is a technique that has been widely used, but it has some disadvantages, which were articulated by Metsky et al. in a recent study of Zika virus (ZIKV) [3] . First, traditional amplicon sequencing typically requires technically challenging normalization and pooling of individual amplicons to cover the entire genome of one specific virus. However, recently a protocol was published for efficient amplicon primer design and multiplex amplicon generation in a single tube for sequencing in the MinION or Illumina platforms [4] . Although this method obviates the amplicon normalization and pooling steps and is effective for producing whole genome sequence data from a low titer ZIKV sample, this method has not been demonstrated for production of whole genome sequence data for multiple diverse viruses from a single complex sample. Additionally, amplicon sequencing typically requires as much as 40 cycles of PCR amplification [4] [5] [6] , which can introduce sequence errors. Furthermore, amplicon-based sequencing is vulnerable to false negative results caused by mutations in primer binding sites, as was recently demonstrated for Dengue virus (DENV) [5] as well as false positive variant results possibly caused by low and/or uneven coverage [7] . By contrast, the use of probes tiled along the entire length of a viral genome to hybridize and select for virus-specific fragments has the potential to produce less false-negative pathogen detection results by virtue of many more potential binding sites along an individual genome and resulting more uniform coverage.",20.320064642240396,10.781740628057149

It could be because of high viral genome heterogeneity. Besides that the researchers often target a particular viral strain and the target site may not be conserved among all other strains. However conservation analysis of highly and least effective siRNAs showed that number highly effective siRNAs are more in the fully conserved regions (0 mismatch) whereas the number of ineffective siRNAs is more in the least conserved regions (>4 mismatches). This suggests that siRNAs selected in the conserved regions tend to be more effective. However siRNAs designed from highly conserved virus genome regions as available in our experimental dataset display all ranges of siRNA inhibition efficacies ranging from 0-100%. This implies that not all siRNAs chosen from conserved regions are highly effective as many other factors like nucleotide frequencies, binary and thermodynamics features etc. contribute to the efficacy of a siRNA besides conservation as used in the VIRsiRNApred development.

Small viral genomes present at low concentrations are effectively drowned out by signal from host nucleic acid and from commensal microorganisms. A variety of methods have been employed to increase the viral signal in highthroughput sequence data, including amplicon sequencing, but for viruses like DENV, with its genome of less than 11 kb in size, even amplicon sequencing is regarded as an inefficient approach for samples with Ct values of 29 or higher [5] . Such limitations have been of particular concern for U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories tasked with biosurveillance and biodefense activities in regions with limited material resources and human We demonstrate here that hybridization-based viral target enrichment yields robust coverage of small genomes from clinical samples, even yielding full-length, deeply covered genomes at concentrations whereby Fig. 3 Detection of close relative viruses irrespective of extensive multiplexing.

The capability to detect and discriminate between multiple serotypes of a virus within a complex sample at clinically relevant concentrations by using this enrichment method increases the utility of high throughput sequencing for biosurveillance and for infectious disease diagnostics. For both biosurveillance and clinical sequencing, assay cost and time are important considerations. We have demonstrated that more extensive pooling and multiplexing can be performed to reduce cost and time without sacrificing the assay's ability to detect at least two strains of related virus and a variety of unrelated viruses in one sequencing reaction.",17.61732550794616,10.109917925965359

In particular, with the parameter ""-B 1"", BWA can align slightly more reads than what Bowtie2 can recruit with the parameter ""L, 0, -0.9"" ((52,688 vs. 52,377). The recruited reads (52,377), however, cover 20%-30% more genomes for the five haplotypes. This indicates that alignmentbased methods tend to identify reads sequenced from highly similar regions between the target and the reference viruses, while the recruitment method is more The ""Alignment"" section contains results for aligned reads. The ""Recruitment"" section contains results for recruited reads by TAR-VIR using the aligned reads. For each row, the aligned reads in ""Alignment"" section are the seed set for the recruited reads in ""Recruitment"" section. For Bowtie2, the ""-score-min"" parameter was set to allow different alignment error rates corresponding to 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. For BWA, ""-A"" is fixed as its default value 1. ""-B"" was modified to allow different error rate similar to Bowtie2. ""Number"" is the number of aligned or recruited reads. ""Depth"" is the average sequencing coverage. ""Coverage"" is the percentage of genome covering by at least one read. h1 to h5 represent the five SARS-CoV haplotypes likely to obtain reads from the whole genome of the target viruses. Worth noting is all the recruited reads are from SARS-CoV (no contamination from Influenza and HBV). Figure 1a and b compared the genome coverage of seed reads and recruited reads. Directly aligning the reads to the bat coronavirus covers only a small proportion of the whole genome (Fig. 1a) , leading to incomplete assembly. Using these aligned reads as seeds, TAR-VIR is able to recruit many more reads that nearly cover the whole genome of SARS-Cov, as shown in Fig. 1b . Table 1 also shows that the numbers of recruited reads do not heavily rely on the number of the seed reads. Even when the seed set is small (e.g. the seed sets constructed using Bowtie2), many new reads can be recruited during each iteration. After multiple iterations, the final set of recruited reads can be significantly larger than the seed set, bounded by the sequencing depth of the haplotypes. On the other hand, if the seed sets contain many reads from non-relevant species, the final set of recruited reads could even include all the reads from the input, which makes the read recruiting useless. Because of this, we prefer to construct the seed set using glocal mode to ensure high quality.",17.075995908250786,8.44342207424306

The 84% coverage figure is a sampling estimate derived from assessing the exact coverage of 26.6 Mb of BAC clone sequence from ENCODE target regions to this assembly, resulting in a higher level of coverage across these regions than an estimated genome average. For example the estimated euchromatic genome size is 2.5 Gb; thus the overall assembled base-pair coverage would be closer to 2.0/2.5 = 80%. The ~4% discrepancy could be due to ENCODE's selection of relatively gene-rich and more highly evolutionarily conserved regions which are likely easier to assemble.

Cas13a from Leptotrichia wadei (LwaCas13a) can be engineered for targeting endogenous transcripts in human HEK293FT cells and in plants. Moreover, the monomeric superfolder GFP (msfGFP) fused LwaCas13a has more stability and specificity and can be developed for programmable tracking of transcripts in live cells [45] . A Cas13b ortholog from Prevotella sp. P5-125 (PspCas13b), which is C-terminally fused to the nuclear export signal (NES) domain of HIV Rev gene, has the most efficient RNA interference in mammalian cells. Through mutation of the conserved catalytic residues in the HEPN domains, dPspCas13b, lacking nuclease activity, can be fused to the deaminase domain of ADARs (ADAR DD ), which naturally deaminates adenosines to insosines in dsRNA and is engineered for modifying RNA, such as RNA editing for programmable A to I (G) replacement (REPAIR). Furthermore, to enhance the specificity of REPAIRv1 by utilizing a rational mutagenesis strategy, mutant ADAR2DD (E488Q/T375G) fused with dCas13b showed a precise, efficient and highly specific RNA targeting which was termed REPAIRv2 [46] . It offers an alternative RNA editing toolset for modifying the residues of proteins, thus altering their function in regulation of disease, such as autoimmune disorders including psoriasis, immunoglobulin A deficiency, type I diabetes and, systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the temporary nature of the REPAIR system restricts its application in diseases caused by temporary changes in cell state and the high off-target efficacy needs more attention in designing the target guide RNA.",12.639049801827104,7.488935446500998

In order to identify a more versatile genome-editing platform with smaller cargo size, Ran et al. found a Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) that is 1 kb shorter compared to SpCas9. This SaCas9 can be packaged in to the highly versatile adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery vector, which is broadly used for clinical research due to the broad range of serotype specificity, reduced oncogenic risk from host-genome integration and low immunogenic potential [20] .

Methods: During Sep-Oct 2011, two clusters of CDI cases were identified in our hospital group in Oxfordshire. Three CDI cases occurred over 3 days on a long-stay medical ward, and three over 22 days in an elective surgery unit. DNA from cultured isolates and the last preceding CDI isolate from each location (12 days and 6 months earlier respectively) was sequenced, four isolates at a time, using the Illumina MiSeq platform in runs lasting 27 hours. Paired 150 base pair reads were mapped to the CD630 reference genome with STAMPY. Variant calls were made using SAMTOOLS, PICARD and Python scripts. Velvet de novo assemblies were used to determine 'in-silico' multi-locus sequence types (MLST) to provide a traditional genotyping comparison to WGS. Results: All eight isolates were successfully sequenced (mean 78.1% of the reference genome called after filtering). Total sample preparation, sequencing and analysis time from receipt of the last positive culture was <1 week. All four medical patients shared time and space on the same ward after diagnosis of the 1st case. Sequence data revealed >4000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between each of the three cases occurring within 3 days excluding the possibility of transmission. However one of the isolates was genetically identical (0 SNVs) to the case from 12 days before, highlighting the likely importance of this case in transmission which had not been considered by the initial infection control investigation. While similar conclusions would have been drawn using MLST, the exact genetic match between the two related cases would not have been known. In contrast, within the surgical unit where all three clustered cases spent time together, MLST data suggested two of the three cases were potentially related, however these two cases were actually 129 SNVs apart refuting the possibility of transmission between them. Intriguingly one of the surgical cases differed by only 7 SNVs from a medical case despite neither patient having been to the same hospital in the last year and the cases living 30 miles apart. Conclusion: Comparing whole genomic sequences distinguishes related from unrelated isolates in a potential CDI outbreak setting. The rapid turnaround of desktop sequencing demonstrates the prospect of using this approach in focused outbreak investigation.",17.571295477087762,9.599262849487278

Locally collinear blocks (LCBs) representing regions of sequence that align in each genome are illustrated as colored rectangles connected by lines. For the KM22 sequence, blocks above the center line are in the same orientation as RB50, blocks below the center line align in the inverse orientation. White areas reflect regions that are not conserved. Symbols are used to mark LCBs whose rearrangement in KM22 relative to RB50 occurs within a single contig, likely reflecting a true rearrangement. three of these regions, the rearrangement is supported by genome sequence assembly data from both strains, such that the position at which the organization changes in KM22 relative to RB50 occurs within a single contig on at least one edge of the region (Fig. 1) . The fourth rearrangement identified occurs at contig boundaries such that it is not possible to determine if a true genome rearrangement has occurred at that site or if the contig ordering is incorrect (Fig. 1) . Genome rearrangements can have profound phenotypic effects on bacterial niche adaptation by impacting gene expression or loss of gene function resulting from genes located near rearrangement breakpoints being placed under control of new transcriptional regulatory elements (Suyama and Bork, 2001) .

Analysis of genomes using whole genome sequencing delivers high-resolution information to differentiate microbial strains that possess difference of as low as one Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), thereby it can replace other multiple tests. For the detection of pathogenic microorganism from patients having suspected infections from uncultivable microbe and or not possible to diagnose by standard diagnostic method, whole genome sequencing method is an ideal option. In such cases, specimen directly from the patient can be sequenced. Here is an example of the strong ability of the whole genome sequencing method in diagnosis of a pediatric instance of alymphocytosis or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and recurrent meningoencephalitis, where this whole genome sequencing together with a dedicated bioinformatics software ) diagnosed the Leptospirasantarosai in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (total DNA from CSF) using Illumina platform within 48 hours' time from the sample collection, where 475 sequence reads were aligned with the pathogen out of 3,063,784 total reads (Wilson et al. 2014) . Similarly, there are a number of cases where whole genome sequencing diagnosed the pathogens from the uncultivable sample in patients having infectious syndrome of uncertain cause.",16.914308617879513,9.291085994868821

Complete sequencing of the isolates allowed detailed direct and statistical analysis of adaptation in SARS-CoV, and it led to conclusions about the most variable regions of the genome during the course of the epidemic.

However, before it was possible to develop these viruses as vectors, it required the complete sequencing of the respective genomes and characterization of the various regions of the viral genome that could be used for insertion of foreign genes. Secondly, it required the production of cell lines for isolation of the recombinants. To achieve these two goals, we needed to complete the entire transcriptional map and sequence the genome of BAV-3 (Reddy et al., 1998) Genbank Accession No. AF030154 (Fig. 1) . From the analysis of the genome and its similarity to other adenoviruses, we focused on characterizing the E1, E3 and E4 regions specifically in order to identify the boundaries of these regions for eventual removal to enhance the coding capacity of the virus for insertion of foreign genes. The combined coding capacity of these three regions in bovine adenovirus-3 is 8 kB (E1, 3.5 kB; E3, 1.2 kB; E4, 3.2 kB).

Soon after this theory was applied to influenza, it was pointed out that rearing operations for chickens often offer great potential for continual transmission from severely ill individuals, much like the potential that occurred in 1918 at the Western Front (Ewald 1994) . Evolutionary considerations therefore predicted recurring chicken epidemics associated with a lethality comparable to that 1918 pandemic. Such severe epidemics have in fact recurred repeatedly in chickenrearing facilities over the past 15 years (Table 5) . A variety of influenza types have been responsible these outbreaks. The recurring epidemics are therefore not simply due to resurgences of one particularly virulent type of avian influenza virus. Rather, the pattern is better explained by a potential for lethal epidemics that is generally present among influenza variants when environmental circumstances allow transmission from very sick hosts.

When no reference genome exists, 454-based pyrosequencing is best suited for de novo assembly due to the long read lengths; however, platforms that output shorter reads are suitable if a scaffold genome is available. The anthrax attacks of 2001 highlight the need for rapid bacterial genome sequencing. 454-based pyrosequencing technology was shown to be capable of generating a draft genome of Bacillus anthracis that could be used to assess relevant genetic variants in less than 24 h . More recently, the genome of the E. coli isolate implicated in the outbreak in Europe was completely sequenced in the matter of a few hours using the Ion Torrent platform. Sequencing a bacterial genome is no longer expensive and it has been estimated that a Streptococcal genome with greater than 150-fold coverage can cost as little as US$100 (Vernet et al., 2011) .

Camels are the likely animal source for zoonotic infection, although exact transmission modes remain to be determined. Human-to-human transmission occurs sporadically. The wide geographic distribution of MERS-CoV among dromedary camels and ongoing transmissions to humans provides concern for the evolution of a MERS-CoV variant with efficient human-to-human transmission capabilities. Phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV has occurred by analysis of full-length genomes or multiple concatenated genome fragments, which is time-consuming, costly and limited to high viral load samples. Objective: To develop a simple, reliable MERS-CoV variant typing assay to facilitate monitoring of MERS-CoV diversity in animals and humans. Study Design: Phylogenetic analysis of presently known full-length MERS-CoV genomes was performed to identify genomic regions with sufficient phylogenetic content to allow reliable MERS-CoV variant typing. RT-PCR assays targeting these regions were designed and optimized. Results: A reverse-transcription PCR assay for MERS-CoV targeting a 615 bp spike fragment provides a phylogenetic clustering of MERS-CoV variants comparable to that of full-length genomes. The detection limit corresponds to a cycle treshold value of ∼35 with standard upE real time PCR assays on RNA isolated from MERS-CoV EMC. Nasal swabs from RT-PCR positive camels (Ct values 12.9-32.2) yielded reliable sequence information in 14 samples.

From this study it can be concluded that RT-PCR assays aimed at amplifying the N and L genes, which code for two internal viral proteins and seemed to be more conserved regions of the genome, appear particularly suitable for detecting hMPV from both lineages [32, 64, 65] . Rapid and sensitive RT-PCR assays for the N gene (detection limit of 100 copies) have been developed allowing rapid amplification and detection of hMPV sequences directly from clinical samples in < 2 h [64, 65] . However, if inadequate primers are selected for PCR amplification, the hMPV detection might be underestimated.",16.445814285242935,8.914737540232672

By contrast, the OTU domain-containing cellular proteins A20, Cezanne, Otubain 1, Otubain 2 and VCIP135 did not exhibit the unique capacity of the viral OTU domain proteases to target both Ub and ISG15 conjugates. Although it is possible that viral OTU domains will still have enhanced specificity for particular conjugated proteins, their broad substrate specificity distinguish them from their host counterparts. Therefore, viral OTU domains may represent a unique class of deconjugating enzymes. We speculate that other viral proteases, perhaps including some that do not have OTU domains, will be found to target both Ub and ISG15 dependent processes. For example, viral DUB activities have been demonstrated for the adenoviral protease adenain (Balakirev et al., 2002) , the N-terminal fragment of the UL36 protein of herpesviruses Schlieker et al., 2005) , and the papain-like proteases from the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Barretto et al., 2005; Lindner et al., 2005; Ratia et al., 2006) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) .

We compared the percent loci per protein that are variant in any sample between 1 and 2 dengue and found significantly fewer unique variant loci in 2 dengue cases, both in PBMC ( Figure 1A ; left panel, p < 0.001) and plasma ( Figure 1A ; right panel, p < 0.01) samples. These observations were not due to systematic disparities in the yields of viral RNA, since measures of genome equivalents (GE) per milliliter of extracted viral RNA were not significantly different between 1 and 2 cases for both PBMC and plasma samples ( Figure 1B ; left and right panels). Thus, DENV-3 appears to be evolving at fewer distinct loci genome-wide in 2 dengue compared with 1 dengue, suggesting that virus evolution is constrained by pre-existing immune pressures in 2 dengue. In addition, we examined the locations of unique variant loci on the exposed and membrane-associated surfaces of the E protein, which is a prominent target for antibody-mediated immunity in human dengue. We detected fewer unique variant loci across all samples in 2 dengue cases compared with 1 cases ( Figure 1C ; top and bottom panels) on both the exposed and the membraneassociated surfaces of E; much of this difference was contributed by PBMC-specific variant loci. Thus, consistent with genome-wide differences between 1 and 2 dengue, the breadth of the viral variant repertoire in E appears to be reduced in 2 dengue compared with 1 dengue. Such global differences in viral composition between naive individuals and individuals with pre-existing immunity to DENV indicate that the extent of diversity in the intrahost DENV-3 population is directed by the immune repertoire during acute dengue in humans. Further studies investigating particular epitopes will help resolve the specificities of pre-existing immune pressures contributing to differential rates of viral microevolution in 1 and 2 dengue.",17.49163502092916,9.581572033688579

Low-cost diagnostics are also required in testing water supplies. Inadequate environmental monitoring capabilities were highlighted by the cholera epidemic in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Although the cholera epidemic took most people by surprise, it wasn't totally unexpected since Haiti ranked last out of 147 countries surveyed in the 2002 Water Poverty Index [25] . Due to globalisation, such epidemics also concern the developed nations. The development of low-cost, rapid quantitative diagnostics will aid in screening large regions and populations.

This reveals some previously undetected correlations between different positions in the sequences recognised by FMDV 3C pro . Thus, sequences with P1-Gln typically also have P2-Lys and a largely hydrophobic residue at P1 (Leu, Ile, Thr). In contrast, in sequences with P1-Glu the preference for P2-Lys is reduced but there is strong selectivity for a small amino acid (Gly or Ser) at P1 . This suggests that interactions between different subsites in the peptide binding cleft of FMDV 3C pro may be important for specificity and, in particular, that recognition of the P1 residue is influenced by the P2 and P1 positions. The sequence specificity identified for junctions with P1-Glu (Fig. 2c) helps to explain why the sequence VRAE/VQ in eIF4AI is cleaved by FMDV 3C pro , but the closely related sequence in eIF4AII (VRNE/MQ) is not (Li, Ross-Smith, Proud, & Belsham, 2001) .",16.756647115429992,9.021101703165236

The use of ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis to randomly create point mutations in the mouse genome has opened up a new forward genetics approach to identifying susceptibility loci (Papathanasiou and Goodnow, 2005 ) . This chemical mutagen, when used at appropriate doses and at the correct stage of development, can introduce single point mutations into the mouse genome. By screening libraries of mutant mice for susceptibility to specifi c pathogens, it should be possible to identify genetic loci that dictate susceptibility or resistance to a range of pathogens on a large scale. It is relatively straightforward to identify a chromosomal region involved in susceptibility in these mouse strains by genotyping with microsatellite markers, but identifying the specifi c gene that is mutated is still very time-consuming. The speed with which this can be achieved depends on the presence of candidate genes within the chromosomal interval or the ability to resequence large amounts of DNA.

Kennemann* 1 , T. Aebischer 2 , S. Kuhn 1 , T.F. Meyer 2 , C. Josenhans 1 Introduction: Helicobacter pylori is one of the bacterial species with highest allelic diversity, due to a high mutation rate and frequent recombination during mixed infections. In a recent whole genome comparison study we demonstrated extensive genomic changes in four sets of sequential isolates obtained from chronically infected Colombians (Kennemann et al., PNAS 2011) . Much less is known about genomic adaptations that may occur in the first months of infection of a new human host. Here, we present the complete genome sequence of H. pylori strain BCS 100 (H1), a cagPAI deficient isolate that has been used for several human challenge studies in the US and Germany, and draft sequences of reisolates obtained from four volunteers after 3 months of infection. Results: The genome sequence of H. pylori challenge strain H1 was obtained by 454 sequencing and subsequent gap closure by targeted Sanger sequencing. Draft genome sequences were obtained by 454 sequencing of one additional input isolate (H3) and four isolates from four volunteers belonging either to the control group or to the Ty21a(UreA/B) vaccinated group. Additional reisolates from 29 volunteers were analyzed at selected loci by Sanger sequencing. Conclusions: In contrast to the sequential isolates from Colombia, no evidence of recombination (import) was detected in the reisolates from infected volunteers. 1-2 novel SNPs were identified in each of the reisolated genomes, permitting the calculation of a robust estimate for the H. pylori in vivo mutation rate. Unexpectedly, a previously unknown variant of the input strain was detected in several volunteers which differed from the 454 sequenced input clone H1 by 86 SNPs and three clusters of nucleotide polymorphisms (CNPs). This variant was commonly detected among the additional reisolates from the study, suggesting strong in vivo selection favoring this subpopulation in some human hosts.",17.338627503022458,8.523340506351706

Genomicsbased methods have already allowed a significant advance in our understanding of the evolution and spread of bacterial pathogens. In the developed world, whole genome sequencing is being established for routine use in clinical microbiology, both for tracking transmission and spread of pathogens, as well as prediction of drugresistance profiles, allowing rapid outbreak detection and analysis in almost real-time, as evolution occurs in the wild [54 ] . Except for influenza A viruses, genetic correlates (surrogates) of the ability of a zoonotic pathogen to efficiently overcome the interspecies barrier and allow rapid spread within the human population are poorly defined. Any emergence of novel molecular patterns in microorganisms results from an evolutionary process driven by factors not encoded for in genomes and determined by the frequencies of genome alterations occurring under natural conditions. The broad introduction of 'omic's' technologies, advances in global data exchange capabilities and the advent of (bio)informatic tools allowing processing of large data collections ('big data') have put the technical capacity to integrate phenotypic data from clinical, from epidemiological and from experimental studies in vitro and in vivo at our disposal, with relevant target species like livestock in particular, and allow genome-wide association studies.

Deletion of Ubp8 or Ubp10 leads to an increase in uH2B; however while Ubp8 is involved in gene activation (see above), Ubp10 functions in gene silencing by deubiquitinating uH2B in silenced regions ( Figure 4A ) (160, 168) . Consistent with a role in silencing, Ubp10 localizes to two silenced domains, telomeres and rDNA (168) and associates with the silencing protein Sir4, a member of the Sir complex composed of two additional proteins, Sir3 and the histone deacetylase Sir2 (169) . Deletion of Ubp10 affects telomeric silencing by increasing the levels of uH2B and subsequently H3K4me and H3K79me, which in turn inhibits the association of the Sir proteins to silent loci (160, 168) . Overexpression of Ubp10 also leads to a loss of silencing at telomeres by globally decreasing uH2B, H3K4me and H3K79me, and the spreading of the Sir complex to nonsilenced regions. This delocalization of the SIR complex is thought to be due to the binding of Sir3 to unmethylated Lys4 of histone H3 in normally non-silenced regions, thus preventing its binding to silenced regions (160, 168, 170) In addition to a role in telomere silencing, Ubp10 appears to have roles in other regions of the genome since the majority of the genes with altered expression in ubp10Δ are not located at telomeres (160) . In support of a role outside telomeric loci, a mutant form of Ubp10 that specifically causes a defect in the silencing of telomeres does not lead to a global increase in H2B ubiquitination or H3K4me. Furthermore, ubp8Δ ubp10Δ cells display a synergistic increase in H2B ubiquitination levels and the expression of non-telomeric genes, indicating that Ubp10 and Ubp8 may act at overlapping regions of the genome (160).",22.483467016202592,9.514755624288155

Ultimately, internationally supported, on-site collaborative networks such as these will allow rapid exchange of information and reagents among skilled professionals and, therefore, enhance research for SARS and other emerging infectious disease threats.",18.745850939529348,9.452260274332783

Direct conjugation strategies which allow for targeted delivery of siRNAs to specific tissues and cell types will enhance the activity of siRNAs in vivo and reduce unwanted effects (Akhtar and Benter, 2007) . Additional complications associated with RNAi in vivo are off-target effects. siRNA sequences used in this study were subjected to a BLAST search to identify and eliminate any anti-FCoV siRNAs with significant homology to feline genes. The current light coverage of the feline genome (1.9-fold) means that homologous feline sequences may be missed during BLAST search, resulting in unexpected and potentially adverse off-target effects. More in depth coverage of the feline genome will help to reduce the chances of offtarget effects, however as many of the off-target effects are mediated by the micro RNA pathway, and can be triggered by limited sequence homology in the seed region of the siRNA (Jackson and Linsley, 2010) , it is more appropriate to talk of minimising off-target effects rather than avoiding them (Behlke, 2006) .",16.2955704118208,10.48638398795213

These data suggest that some aspects of the genomic location of VSG genes may be important for their activation. How-ever, analyses of restriction enzyme sites located 5' to the barren regions indicates that there are several sites in the genome from which VSG genes can be transcribed (Longacre et al., 1983; Myler et al., submitted; Allison et al., submitted) .

Therefore, LAMP primers designed with known genome may result in false positive if they bind on some unknown genome. To guarantee primers' specificity, we appointed upper PCR primer of F5 fimbriae to F2 in FIP of LAMP primers [3] , then designed following primers online, thus it reduced workload of detecting primers' specificity. In a LAMP reaction, inner primer F2 in FIP hybridizes to F2c in the target DNA and initiates complementary strand synthesis at first. Outer primer F3 slowly hybridizes to F3c in the target DNA and initiates strand displacement DNA synthesis, releasing a FIP-linked complementary strand, which can form a looped out structure at one end. This single-stranded DNA serves as template for BIP-initiated DNA synthesis and subsequent B3-primed strand displacement DNA synthesis, leading to the production of a dumb-bell form DNA, which is quickly converted to a stem-loop DNA by self-primed DNA synthesis [10] .

Inherent limitations. Although microarray-based methods are a powerful and simple approach to characterizing genomic variation, there are a number of limitations. The greatest limitation in comparison with de novo sequencing methods is the fact that only known sequence is interrogated. Most microarrays have been made using a reference sequence that was obtained using wholegenome Sanger sequencing of one or a few members of a species. Therefore, if additional individuals that contain genomic loci that were not detected in the initial sequencing are analysed using these arrays then these genomic regions will be completely missed in the analysis. This is likely to represent a small proportion of any genome, but in yeast there are a number of cases of genes that are found in some strains but that are not present in the reference sequence 98 . it seems likely that this will be a general case for many species. once such genes have been found in other individuals it makes sense to incorporate them into subsequent microarray designs. An additional limitation for microarrays is the analysis of highly repetitive regions. This includes regions or features of the genome that are present in multiple copies, such as transposons and telomeres as well as low-complexity DNA that contains repetitive motifs. lowcomplexity DNA poses a particular problem for detecting sequence variation because hybridization efficiency seems to be much more variable in these regions and is a common source of false positives.",20.160864262861015,10.86263194499284

This difference is highly dependent on the length of the oligonucleotide and in practice is likely to only be within the range of detection for oligonucleotides that are shorter than 50 bp. Therefore, short probes are required to interrogate sequence differences between genomes.

One way of mapping insertion sequence variation is to isolate the insertion element and its immediately neighbouring DNA. Specific regions of the genome are isolated using either a capture probe method (as illustrated in the diagram) or a PCR-based method. This approach is suited to mapping the location in the genome of mobile genetic elements, which are notoriously difficult to characterize using wholegenome sequencing approaches. As shown in the figure, DNA is fragmented in the first step (a). Two separate reactions selectively enrich for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the insertion sequence using sequence-specific capture probes (b). The 5′-enriched and the 3′enriched fractions are labelled with different fluorophores (Cy5 and Cy3, respectively) and then hybridized to a microarray using a two-colour protocol (c). Finally, insertion sites are mapped on the basis of a transition (indicated by an arrow in d) from positive to negative log 2 ratio, corresponding to sample that is enriched for DNA adjacent to the 5′ end of the insertion sequence and sample that is enriched for DNA adjacent to the 3′ end of the insertion sequence, respectively. The site of transition corresponds to the genomic location of the insertion sequence. Each red and blue bar represents a microarray probe in a contiguous region of the genome spanning ~10 kb.

A study of 63 isolates of SARSCoV, including animal and human strains was performed by the Chinese SARS consortium to determine rates of mutation along the course of the epidemic (Chinese, 2004) . Complete sequencing of the isolates allowed detailed direct and statistical analysis of adaptation in SARS-CoV, and it led to conclusions about the most variable regions of the genome during the course of the epidemic.

The committee recommended that the United States begin the HGP in 1988 (NRC, 1988) . They emphasized the need for technological improvements in the efficiency of gene mapping, sequencing, and data analysis capabilities. In order to understand potential functions of human genes through comparative sequence analyses, they also advised that the HGP must not be restricted to the human genome and should include model organisms including mouse, bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, and worm. In the meantime, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) of the US Congress also issued a similar report to support the HGP (OTA, 1988) .

Scientists Look into Their Crystal Balls,"Globalization of travel and trade, loss of wildlife habitats, growth of megacities, mass migrations due to economic privation and political instability and changes in the distribution of mosquitoes due to climate change will continue to enable the emergence of viruses that might otherwise remain sequestered (Lipkin, 2013) . We recently estimated that mammals alone harbor more than 300,000 new viruses (Anthony et al., 2013) . At present, we have no way of ascertaining from viral sequence data alone which of them poses substantive threats to humans, wildlife, or domestic animals. However, investments in sequencing, bioinformatics, and systems biology may translate into algorithms that allow us to assess potential for host switching and pathogenicity. At minimum, knowledge of which viruses are circulating and where will enable targeted surveillance in populations at risk for exposure. Surveillance will also become increasingly efficient as diagnostic capacity improves in the developing world. It will be critical to address potential concerns regarding sovereignty and intellectual property if we are to ensure that investigators will be amenable to sharing data and isolates. Public enthusiasm for social media may lead to a global viral equivalent of the American Gut Project wherein citizen scientists share fecal samples and data to develop a human bacteriome database linked to information concerning diet, geography, season, health, and disease (http://humanfoodproject.com/americangut/). A key question that remains to be addressed is whether there are commensal or symbiotic viral flora. Do viruses, like bacteria, have a role in priming or regulating the immune system? Do viruses (primarily bacteriophage) regulate the composition or abundance of bacterial flora? If so, is there an optimum viral microflora and how is it established? Can it be modified? Improvements in diagnostics and insights into the role of viruses in health and disease will provide incentives for the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Our armamentarium for herpesviruses, HIV and HCV will expand to include drugs that address not only chronic infections like HPV and HBV that have life threatening sequelae but also acute, self-limited infections (e.g., rhinoviruses) that interfere with activities of daily living and productivity. At present, antiviral discovery typically begins with screening of massive compound libraries. Compounds with activity are then modified and optimized through medicinal chemistry. This brute force approach will ultimately give way to more elegant strategies for rational drug design based in genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and cellular biology. These drugs will target not only the viruses themselves, but also host responses that contribute to viral replication, morbidity, and mortality. Insights into viral biology and evolution and host response will profoundly impact vaccine research. Vaccines will be optimized to expedite the development of protective immune responses, enhance immunity in the very young and the very old, and to increase the duration of protection. Vaccines will target conserved conformational domains to enable immunity to representatives of higher order viral taxa rather than only specific strains. New platforms will be established that facilitate inexpensive, rapid production and atraumatic immunization.",17.540576967689805,9.817420005383784

The output of the alignment ( Figure  1A ) is manually inspected for regions of sequence conservation and primers are designed manually or using an automated primer design pipeline. In the absence of perfect sequence conservation in a region, a degenerate primer is designed. During synthesis, each primer is usually linked to a M13 tag to facilitate high-throughput direct sequencing of amplicons. Sequence reads are then assembled and areas of low coverage are targeted for genome closure ( Figure 1C ). Ideally, this procedure aims to achieve four-to-sixfold sequencing coverage for any region of the genome; in cases of poor sequence quality or low amplification leading to low coverage (i.e., less than fourfold coverage by two separate amplicons) the corresponding area is selected for direct PCR amplification followed by sequencing of the PCR product to increase the coverage level and validate the consensus sequence.",17.964322460894135,9.79184574943932

Based on read length and sequence accuracy, the 454 method has arguably emerged as the best candidate for large scale sequencing of RNA viruses. However, due to the high cost of one 454 sequencing run and the relatively small sizes of RNA viruses, optimal use of the 454 requires multiplexing of several viral isolates. Given the output of the 454 pyrosequencing (currently at 100 Mbp bases) it is in principle possible to multiplex hundreds of RNA viral genomes in a single run with adequate coverage to resolve sequence polymorphisms. There have been several successful attempts to barcode different samples and demonstrate the use of 454 for multiplex genome sequencing [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .

Sensitivity can be a challenge with multiplex platforms. In multiplex PCR reactions sensitivity decreases with increasing primer complexity. Microarrays and deep sequencing typically employ unbiased amplification methods wherein host and microbial sequences can compete for polymerase and nucleotides. Improvements in sensitivity can be achieved by using methods that deplete host DNA, ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences through enzymatic digestion or subtractive hybridization prior to unbiased amplification. One can also pursue positive selection using oligonucleotides representing microbes of interest. With high throughput sequencing bioinformatics is frequently the weakest link. The least expensive platforms (e.g. Illumina) typically produce shorter sequence reads that can be difficult to assemble. More expensive platforms (e.g. 454 Life Sciences) typically yield longer but fewer reads; hence, assembly is easier but at a cost of lower coverage. One solution is to join such platforms and use the longer reads to establish a scaffold that can be completed using the shorter reads.

The current barriers to the routine use of viral metagenomics as a diagnostic tool include its current complexity and slow speed, difficult data interpretation, and access to more streamlined alternative methods such as qPCR, or microarrays [83, 84] . The random amplification and DNA library construction protocols are currently complex but likely to become simplified and faster in the near future. The sequencing time itself is also likely to be reduced. Shrinking the time from clinical sample collection to sequence data generation and bioinformatics analysis to a medically useful few hours to a day will enhance the appeal of a sequencing approach for diagnostic purposes. The issue of sensitivity to allow the detection of very few copies of viral genomes will also have to be compared, using spiked samples, to highly sensitive PCR based and microarray methods. Cost will likely remain a major barrier especially when compared to a single qPCR assay in cases where only testing for a single virus is indicated. Further limitations include access to appropriate computational power needed to analyze very large sequence data sets. What level of sequence divergence to a reference viral genome (i.e. BLAST E score) will be tolerable and how many matches to different regions of the genome will be required to confirm the presence of a virus remain to be determined. The persistent problem of DNA contamination and the medical significance of very low level of viral nucleic acid detection will also need to be resolved.

Virus discovery can be achieved through bulk metagenomes or viromes, while viral ecology studies will tend to rely more on viromes as a reflection of virus activity and transport, and metagenomics used as a diagnostic tool in the clinic would be the most likely to use sequence capture. Nevertheless, all these complementary approaches will be needed for achieving a comprehensive picture of viral diversity. specific assays for each pathogen. Metagenomics instead offers the possibility to detect known and novel viruses without prior knowledge from a single analysis, and is thus well suited and already applied to study emerging and/or rare viruses, as well as cases which remain negative using the available diagnostic tests (see below). A number of challenges remain however for viral metagenomics to become a standard clinical procedure. First, given the current cost associated with sample processing and sequencing, metagenomes are still more expensive and slower than ELISA's or qPCR assays. Second, there is no generally validated bioinformatics pipelines than can perform a rapid, sensitive, and specific analysis of the obtained data on a bench top computer. Finally, physicians will have to be trained and guided to deal with the obtained breadth of data. Specifically, it is becoming clear that each individual is chronically infected with a dozen or more eukaryotic viruses (many of which have not been associated with any disease, e.g., anelloviruses), and that many known viral pathogens can also cause asymptomatic infections. Therefore, a physician might get a list of viruses (and other potentially pathogenic or unknown organisms), and it will be a challenge to identify the actual cause of a particular disease. Nevertheless, the price of sample preparation and high throughput sequencing has declined enormously in the last decade including with the development of smaller and faster machines, while automatic virome Fig. 1 Overview of the viral metagenomics workflow. The overall process used to generate and analyze viral metagenomes can be divided into four major steps: (i) Collection of environmental and/or clinical sample, (ii) sample preparation, (iii) library preparation, and (iv) sequence analysis. The sample preparation step can target either the cellular fraction (left) or the viral fraction (right) in which case viral particles are often further concentrated and purified to remove free nucleic acids. *Targeted sequence capture can be applied to the extracted DNA/RNA to enrich for a specific virus. **While whole genome amplification was initially used routinely for viral metagenomes, it has now been supplanted by methods enabling the preparation of more quantitative libraries from low input (B 1 ng), hence whole genome amplification is now primarily used in single-cell or single-virus-particle experiments. ***The genome assembly can be bypassed if using long-read sequencing technologies, although these long-read datasets require a more careful error correction. ****Genome binning, i.e., the identification of multiple contigs assembled from a metagenome and corresponding to the same genome, is typically only used for large genomes (e.g., 4500 kb), and individual contigs are directly analyzed instead for most viruses.",15.935239133201932,10.435109635131571

First, long-read sequencing technologies are progressively amenable to the sequencing of environmental viral communities. Pragmatically, this means that instead of having to assemble virus genomes from short reads, a process which can yield potentially erroneous and/or incomplete genome sequences, a complete viral genome could be sequenced as a single read. Once broadly available, these long-reads metagenomes will not only bypass assembly issues but also provide valuable information about virus genome evolution by enabling whole-genome phasing of polymorphisms. Meanwhile, in an epidemiological context, long-read sequencing technologies associated with miniaturized devices, streamlined sample preparation, and live scanning of the sequencing results offers unique possibility for real-time surveillance or diagnostics. This is especially the case for the MinION sequencer based on Nanopore sequencing technology, allowing the identification of viral pathogens from a patient sample in less than 6 h, compared to more than 20 h for other sequencing technologies. The computational framework to analyze and share these types of data in a timely, safe, and meaningful way remains to be built, however it is likely that metagenomics through portable genome sequencers will become a major component of the epidemiological toolkit in the near future.",15.424021537064936,10.202323551213542

The committee recommended that the United States begin the HGP in 1988. 3 They emphasized the need for technological improvements in the efficiency of gene mapping, sequencing, and data analysis capabilities. In order to understand potential functions of human genes through comparative sequence analyses, they also advised that the HGP must not be restricted to the human genome and should include model organisms including mouse, bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, and worm. In the meantime, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) of the US Congress also issued a similar report to support the HGP. 4 In 1990, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) jointly presented an initial 5-year plan for the HGP. 5 In October 1993, the Sanger Center/Institute (Hinxton, UK) was officially open to join the HGP. The cost of DNA sequencing was about $2 to $5 per base in 1990 and the initial aim was to reduce the costs to less than $0.50 per base before large-scale sequencing. 5 The sequencing cost gradually declined during the subsequent years. In 2004, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) challenged scientists to achieve a $100,000 human genome (3 Gb/haploid genome) by 2009 and a $1000 genome by 2014 to meet the need of genomic medicine. In early 2014, Illumina announced that the company would begin producing a new system to deliver full coverage human genomes for less than $1,000. 6 The first complete genome to be sequenced was the phiX174 bacteriophage (5.4 kb) by Sanger's group in 1977. 7 The complete genome sequence of SV40 polyomavirus (5.2 kb) was published in 1978. 8, 9 The human EpsteineBarr virus (170 kb) genome was determined in 1984. 10 The first completed free-living organism genome was Haemophilus influenza (1.8 Mb), sequenced through a whole-genome shotgun approach in 1995. 11 The second sequenced bacterial genome, Mycoplasma genitalium (600 kb), was completed in less than 1 month in the same year using the same approach. 12 The DOE was the first to start a microbial genome program (MGP) as a companion to its HGP in 1994. 13 The initial focus was on nonpathogenic microbes. Along with the development of the HGP, there was exponential growth of the number of completely sequenced free-living organism genomes. The Fungal Genome Initiative (FGI) 14 was established in 2000 to accelerate the slow pace of fungal genome sequencing since the report of the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996. 15 One of the major interests was to sequence organisms that are important in humanhealth and commercial activities. With the explosion in the number of sequenced genomes, thanks to the development of next generationesequencing methods, many genome-based studies have become popular. Compared to 6 years ago when only 1100 completed genome projects were documented, the GOLD (Genomes OnLine Database) contains information for 67,879 genome-sequencing projects, of which 7210 were completed, as of August 2015. 16, 17 The genomes of human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and its major mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae were published in 2002. 18, 19 Historically, the effort to sequence the malaria genome began in 1996 by taking advantage of a clone derived from laboratory-adapted strain. 20 Notably, many parasites have complex life cycles that involve both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts and are difficult to maintain in the laboratory. Few other important human pathogenic parasites, such as trypanosomes, 21, 22 Leishmania, 23 and schistosomes, 24, 25 have been either completely or partially sequenced. 26, 27 In the meantime, the genome sequence of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for yellow fever and dengue fever, was published in 2007. 28 The genome size (1376 Mb) of this mosquito vector is about 5 times larger than the previously sequenced genome of the malaria vector A. gambiae. About 50% of the genome consists of transposable elements. In 2010, the genome sequence of the body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus), an obligatory parasite of humans and the main vector of epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii), relapsing fever (Borrelia recurrentis), and trench fever (Bartonella quintana), was reported. 29 Its 108 Mb genome is the smallest among the known insect genomes. Subsequently, more vector genomes have been published. 30e32 Genome-sequencing projects for other important human disease vectors are in progress. 33, 34 These include Culex pipiens (mosquito vector of West Nile virus), and Ixodes scapularis (tick vector of Lyme disease, Babesia and Anaplasma). The challenge to sequence the genome of an insect vector is much greater than a microbe. For example, the genome of ticks was estimated to be between 1 and 7 Gb and may have a significant proportion of repetitive DNA sequences, which may be a problem for genome assembly. 35 Furthermore, the evolutionary distances among insect species may also affect homologybased gene predictions.",15.47484092145974,9.391886868878554

Despite the observed variability of FCVs, comparative genetic analysis has failed to separate isolates of FCV into distinct clusters or genogroups. There appears to be no clear correlation between the sequence of a virus and either its year or location of isolation, or with the particular disease with which it is associated.

[11] [12] [13] This variability of the FCV genome has important implications to the antigenicity of this virus. The sequence variability has been shown to be particularly pronounced in key regions of the capsid protein that are responsible for the antigenic structure of the virus. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that most strains of FCV can be distinguished from one another on the basis of their antigenicity. However, there is sufficient cross-reactivity between FCV strains to allow them to be grouped together in a single serotype and to allow some degree of cross-protection between the majority of strains.

The most common and efficient strategies are in-solution capture methods offered by Roche/NimbleGen's SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library and Agilent's SureSelect Human All Exon. Several publications have compared the specificity and sensitivity of these platforms [44] [45] [46] .

The baits are longer than those used in NimbleGen's platform (114 À 126 bp) and the corresponding target sequences are adjacent to one another rather than overlapping.

In the first, only the target sequences were simulated into draft, and the NN sequences remained as finished sequences. In the second, the NN sequences were converted to simulated draft and the target sequences remained as finished. In the third, both target and NN sequences were simulated into draft. In the second and third cases, all the NNs were run through the draft simulator each time they were chosen, so that the draft sequences (i.e. location and extent of gaps and sequence errors) differ for the same genome among samples. In the first and third cases, the target sequences must be aligned, and WGASA requires that one of the sequences be a finished genome for reference. Thus, for each random sample from the pool of target genomes, one genome was randomly selected to be the finished genome, and so was left as finished sequence, and the other genomes in the sample were replaced with simulated draft sequence (by running through the draft simulator) before alignment. As with NNs, target draft sequences differ for the same genome among samples due to the randomness of the draft simulation each time it is run. In addition, the target genome that is chosen to be the finished, reference genome differs between samples, and the other target genomes in the sample simulation are replaced with simulated draft versions of the actual finished sequences. Then these sequences were aligned using WGASA and the SAP process was run as described above. A total of 1101 stochastic simulations per 'experiment' were performed, requiring $18 min per simulation. Each simulation involved randomly selecting the subset of target and NN sequences to be included, simulating the draft data based on the finished genomes, aligning the target sample, and finally running the DNA Signature Pipeline.

As a new generation of molecular gene therapy, miRNAs would be expected to have a high degree of specificity for their targets. However, since miRNA action is based on imperfect base pairing with the target sequence in most circumstances, the specificity will be lower than that of siRNA. This prediction has been confirmed by recent clinical trials, followed up by microarray analysis, which revealed possible off-target effects of miRNAs. [102] Another follow-up study by Birmingham et al., [103] using the combination of bioinformatics and microarray analysis, found that using either the siRNA or the miRNA could result in off-target silencing. In addition, in vivo studies have revealed that one miRNA may target several genes at the same time, and the targets are not clearly identified. This suggests diverse modes of action of a given single miRNA. On the other hand, one gene may be regulated by several miRNAs, [104] indicating that the mode of action is more complicated than expected. Since drug therapies must precisely target the virus in question and nothing else, a large undertaking is needed to gather all possible information regarding all targets of each miRNA that is being considered for drug development.

Therefore, the development of a rapid and simple method for on-site detection of SARS-CoV is crucial for the identification and prevention of future SARS outbreaks. In this study, a simple colorimetric and multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed to rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It can be visually detected based on color change and monitored in real-time with fluorescent signals. The performance of this assay, based on six primers targeting open reading frame (ORF1b) and nucleocapsid (N) genes located in different regions of the SARS-CoV, was compared with real-time RT-PCR assay using various concentrations of target genes. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was comparable to that of real-time RT-PCR assay and therefore a few target RNA to 10 4 -10 5 copies could be detected within a short period of time (20-25 min). In addition, we established a multiplex real-time LAMP assay to simultaneously detect two target regions within the SARS-CoV genome. Two target sequences were amplified by specific primers in the same reaction tube and revealed that it was able to detect down to 10 5 copies. The standard curve had a linear relationship with similar amplification efficiencies. The LAMP assay results in shorter ""sample-to-answer"" time than conventional PCR method. Therefore, it is suitable not only for diagnosis of clinical test, but also for surveillance of SARS virus in developing countries.",17.671885524531938,8.416779530067501

To meet the needs for routine clinical testing, compact NGS systems have been developed with a small footprint and fast turnaround time. Using these systems, sequencing could replace complex multifaceted traditional microbiological identification procedures such as biochemical testing, and sequencing could detect virulence determinants and the genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance. Sequencing, however, may miss new and uncharacterized genetic elements responsible for phenotypic resistance mechanisms. This will require companies to perform extensive phenotypic/genotypic comparisons and may in addition require gene expression analysis for detecting complex phenotypes (eg, changes in porin expression related to carbapenem resistance). Sequence data has already proved its value in tracking outbreaks of infection due to resistant bacteria (eg, the NIH outbreak of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria [55] and the cholera outbreak in Haiti [50] ). Future studies need to address the clinical relevance of finding a fragment of nucleic acid that may not correlate with the patient's clinical syndrome. Finally, NGS systems need easy, concise, low-cost data management and interpretation software and access to well-vetted databases.

Distances of outlier from first potential donor often fall within the intra-genomic range ( However, in some instances, the outlier-to-donor distance is too great to consider the 'closest' species as potential donor. In contrast, unusual small values deserve a specific attention. In particular, the very small distance between bacteriophage SPBc2 and '2150751-2285750' atypical region (d = 2) allows to spot the part of B.subtilis genome where bacteriophage SPBc2 is incorporated (12, 47) . Other regions in the genome are also found similar (in terms of signature) to bacteriophage SPBc2. Most of them correspond to bacteriophages, imbedded in B.subtilis genome, whose free forms are not sequenced (12, 47) . Observed similarities with SPBC2 are, however, expected since signatures of phages usually share some characteristics with the species they infect (48) . The SPBc2 sequence is the only foreign sequence identified in B.subtilis, using homology as criterion (BlastN, with parameters set to default). In fact, Blast analysis of B.subtilis outliers leads to contrasted results. Besides SPBc2 and 7 out of 9 prophages imbedded in the genome, the only atypical regions identified are those containing the 30 rRNA genes coded in B.subtilis genome. The only few genes that are homologous to parts of atypical regions are found in species belonging to the Bacillus genus.

Unfortunately, the location and length of horizontal transfers (HTs) are known for very few species. The usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence (the so-called genomic signature) has been shown to be species-specific even in DNA fragments as short as 1 kb. The genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect HTs. Since DNA transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species, the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous DNA. The strategy consists in (i) scanning the genome with a sliding window, and calculating the corresponding local signature (ii) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and (iii) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures. A total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way. It has been observed that atypical regions make up $6% of each genome on the average. Most of the claimed HTs as well as new ones are detected. The origin of putative DNA transfers is looked for among $12 000 species.

However, in the last several decades, a new set of technologies has become available, based on the methods of computer sciences, systems biology, and the extraordinary powers of the Internet. Technological and analytical advances can enhance traditional epidemiological methods to study the emergence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of viruses and associated diseases. Social media are increasingly used to detect the emergence and geographic spread of viral disease outbreaks. Large-scale population movement can be estimated using satellite imagery and mobile phone use, and fine-scale population movement can be tracked using global positioning system (GPS) loggers, allowing estimation of transmission pathways and contact patterns at different spatial scales. Advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics permit more accurate determination of viral evolution and the construction of transmission networks, also at different spatial and temporal scales. Phylodynamics links evolutionary and epidemiological processes to better understand viral transmission patterns. More complex and realistic mathematical models of virus transmission within human and animal populations, including detailed agent-based models, are increasingly used to predict transmission patterns and the impact of control interventions such as vaccination and quarantine. In this chapter, we will briefly review traditional epidemiological methods and then describe the new technologies with some examples of their application.",15.358445925568441,9.700732615658854

In both of these approaches (adopted for the characterization of FMD outbreaks in the United Kingdom in 2001 and 2007), a large number of specific primers were required. Furthermore, these oligonucleotides are specific for defined lineages of FMDV, limiting their use for study of other genotypes of FMDV. Other FMD laboratories have used similar approaches also requiring large numbers of primers (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Additional protocols, such as rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), can be used to generate sequence data for the terminal ends of the genome and regions close to the poly (C) tract of FMDV. To reduce the complexity of the cycle-sequencing reactions, recognition sequences for universal sequencing primers (such as M13) can be incorporated into the 5 ¢ ends of the primers used for PCR ( see Fig. 1a ). Alternative approaches, such as shotgun cloning (for example, Fig. 1c ) are also being considered for full-genome sequencing. Initially, these use long-range PCR to amplify large fragments of the virus genome (possibly even encompassing entire genomic sequences). These PCR products are subsequently fragmented and cloned into plasmid vectors prior to sequencing and reconstruction of the viral sequence. Since this approach uses only two viral-specific primers (which can be targeted to highly conserved regions) and is not reliant on internal virus-specific primers, this method may provide a more suitable approach that has a broader sensitivity to different viral variants. However, these methods need to balance the advantages in diagnostic sensitivity that are gained from using a smaller number of primers with the drawback of lower analytical sensitivity that may arise from amplifying large PCR products (in comparison to shorter fragments).",17.203436216489564,10.191293434571854

In a recent study, Kumar et al. (187) used 4 sets of primers, targeting different regions of the 16S rRNA gene, namely V1-V3, V4-V6 and V7-V9, to amplify subgingival biofilm samples from 10 periodontitis patients. The authors observed significant differences across the microbial communities generated by different target regions. Finally, the authors concluded that primers targeting both regions V1-V3 and V7-V9 should be used in deep sequencing efforts to characterize heterogeneous communities. In subsequent paper from the same group (124), the authors used pyrosequencing to compare the subgingival microbiota in periodontal health and disease. After using stringent methods for the selection of target regions for amplification and for data analysis, the authors observed clear differences in the microbial profiles of the 2 conditions, primarily in the levels of P. gingivalis, T. denticola and F. alocis, which were the most prominent species in diseased sites and S. mitis and S. sanguinis, which were the dominant taxa in periodontal health.

In 1977, Sanger et al. developed a method that revealed the first complete genome sequence of a virus. 43 This 'first generation sequencing' used capillaryeelectrophoresis methods to sequence DNA fragments, a process that was expensive and slow. 44 The terms 'second generation' or 'next generation' sequencing (NGS) refer to methods that parallelize the sequencing process, thus dramatically lowering costs and increasing capacity. NGS first became available in 2004 and a number of different sequencing platforms are currently commercially available. 45 These include the Illumina Platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), 454 genome sequencer (Roche Applied Science, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), SOLiD platform (Life Technologies, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as well as the first bench-top machines such as the MiSeq (Illumina) and IonTorrent platforms (Life Technologies) which are anticipated to be among the first platforms to be routinely implemented for clinical applications. Late in 2012 it is anticipated that the GridION platform (Oxford Nanopore, Oxford, UK) will enter the marketplace. 46 Genome assembly Sequencing machines generate thousands of small DNA sequences, called reads, which can be between 40 and 1000 base pairs in length depending on the technique used. Each read represents the sequence of a small fraction of the genome. The reads overlap so that each position of the genome is included in several reads. This number is called 'the coverage'. To be useful, the reads need to be assembled into the whole genome sequence. This can be done in one of two ways; either by comparison with a previously sequenced 'reference' strain (mapping-based assembly), or by piecing the reads together on the basis of their overlaps (de novo assembly). 47, 48 Mapping-based assembly produces results that are easier to interpret, but are dependent upon the choice of reference genome, so that sequences not present in the reference genome remain unmapped. In principle, de novo assembly can recover the whole genome, but in practice it returns several assembled regions (called contigs) whose further assembly tends to remain unresolved. In either case, longer read lengths and higher coverage make assembly easier and more accurate. 49 Storing the reads for a single S. aureus genome requires about 1 GB of storage space; roughly equivalent to 10 music albums in MP3 format. The term highthroughput sequencing is used to refer to newer sequencing technologies that can generate sequence data faster and more economically than previous platforms. Consequently, sequencing platforms are rated according to their throughput speeds, set-up and processing costs and length of reads produced. 45 A medium-sized sequencing facility can process thousands of bacterial isolates in a year. New platforms (Oxford Nanopore and Ion Proton) offer the promise of projected cost reductions to the order of US $1,000 for a whole human genome, sequenced in 15 min to 2 h. Such performance would translate into sequencing costs for bacteria of about US $1 per whole genome.",17.93154243425664,10.035840953674395

Therefore, one question that is frequently asked is, when will it be cheaper to recollect the data than store the data? Although storage of raw sequencing data is a somewhat different problem than the organization of genomes to allow maximum use by researchers, it provides a valuable illustration as to where our capacity for genome sequencing is heading. Perhaps, in the not too distant future, it will not be unusual to have our own genome sequenced, as well as our various organ microbiomes and the genomes of any pathogens we are infected by. To deal with the benefits of the new sequencing technology's ability to generate massive sequence coverage, which helps to reduce errors in the initial sequencing process and reveals the natural variation among the genomes of a virus population, we must also develop new annotation strategies such as how to annotate SNPs in virus genomes and gene fragments in the non-essential gene sets of large viruses. The goal of this type of annotation is to provide the virologist with more information in comparative studies. Often large viruses with different virulence phenotypes are compared through asking, what genes are in virus A and absent in virus B?

Initially applied to the bacterial microbiome, deep sequencing has similarly detected a multitude of viral genome sequences, and changed hitherto common views on persisting viral infections [1] , putting forward the concept of the ""virome"" in general, and of the ""human viromes"" in particular [2] . While the numeric summary of viral genome sequences is mind-blowing, even after careful annotation and curation through refined bioinformatic tools, the utility of massive parallel sequencing has been prominently demonstrated in epidemiologic cluster analysis, for example, leading to the identification of a novel arenavirus as the cause of donor-derived death of 3 solid organ transplant recipients [3] , or of a novel human polyomavirus causing lethal multiorgan failure in a pancreas transplant recipient [4] . Given the technical and bioinformatic advances as well as the declining laboratory costs, the application of deep sequencing to identify etiologic agents in clinical samples has been approached in different pathologies, including those caused by community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs).",16.24286484517029,8.499673115502594

Methods: The array was designed using the guidelines of Affymetrix Corporation. Genogrouping: alignments of available ctrA and siaD gene sequences were performed and eight fragments (total 0.91 kbp) identified that could predict genogroups A, B, C, 29E, H, W135, X, Y and Z.

London GAS were compared with strains from a global collection of GAS via the internet accessible MLST database (http://www.mlst.net). Methods: An MLST sequence type (ST) was assigned to each isolate based on sequence of internal fragments of seven housekeeping loci. emm-type was defined by 160-bp of sequence at the 50end of the central emm gene. All isolates were tested for susceptibility to erythromycin and tetracycline. Results: Between July and October 2003, 121 clinical isolates were collected from 121 persons, including hospitalised patients (9%) and outpatients attending emergency rooms (31%), speciality outpatient clinics (6%) and GPs (48%). Forty-one STs were identified of which 20 were represented by a single isolate. The eight most prevalent types among the 121 GAS were ST117/ emm81 (15%), ST39/emm4 (9%), ST62/emm87 (7%), ST28/ emm1 (6%), ST36/emm12 (6%), ST46/emm22 (5%), ST326/ emm82 (5%) and ST101/emm89 (4%). When compared with the MLST database 14 (34%) of the 41 STs had not been previously identified, although six of these differed from recognised STs at only a single locus suggesting they were closely related. Resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline was seen in 5 and 18% of isolates, respectively, with three isolates resistant to both agents. Resistant isolates included strains with 12 distinct STs. Of these five STs were represented by both resistant and susceptible isolates. Conclusions: GAS strains with higher emm types (>80) accounted for a significant proportion of GAS isolates collected during this study. This information may have important ramifications for emm-directed vaccine strategies. The appearance of resistant isolates was not associated with particular clones. Objectives: Searching in the genome sequence of S. pneumoniae revealed the presence of a single eucaryotic-like Ser/Thr protein kinase gene stkP, associated with a gene encoding Ser/Thr protein phosphatase phpP. Eucaryotic-like protein kinases and phosphatases in procaryotes coordinate processes of differentiation and pathogenesis. Thus, StkP and PhpP may play a role in pneumococcal pathogenesis. The main objective of this work was to determine the targets of protein kinase StkP. Methods: In order to determine the function of StkP we prepared deletion of the corresponding gene in S. pneumoniae by PCR ligation mutagenesis and allelic exchange. To identify the genes that are controlled by StkP we analysed the transcription profile of stkP loss-of-function mutant by DNA microarray technology. Results: Measurement of transformation efficiency during natural competence development showed that deletion of stkP gene in S. pneumoniae resulted in the loss of genetic competence. The transcript analysis revealed the StkP-dependent expression of many potential target loci that were specifically and strongly up-and downregulated in stkP mutant suggesting the important regulatory role of StkP in S. pneumoniae. The data obtained from transcriptome mapping were further extended by proteomic studies. Mass spectrometric sequencing was used to identify putative targets of post-translational modification. Conclusions: In conclusion, genes whose transcription was induced or repressed in S. pneumoniae stkP deletion mutant were identified. Proteomic studies and mass spectrometry were used to confirm some of the results. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the use of pyrosequencing analysis of a variable region within the rnpB gene as species-specific target in identification of bacteria within the Streptococcus genus. Methods: The rnpB gene is universally present in bacterial species and encodes a subunit of the RNaseP enzyme. Comparison of rnpB DNA sequences has been shown to be useful in phylogenetic studies of bacterial genera (Täpp et al., 2003) . A short region of this gene was used as target in pyrosequencing, which is a rapid real-time method for sequencing-by-synthesis. Results: The rnpB DNA sequences from 49 streptococcal species were aligned to identify target regions for PCR and DNA sequencing. The rnpB P3 region was chosen as the target, as this region is highly variable and is flanked by conserved DNA regions. The target region was amplified in PCR using DNA prepared from type strains as well as clinical isolates as templates. These amplicons were then analysed by pyrosequencing. Obtained DNA sequences 20-25 bases in length were found to be sufficiently informative for identification of most species in BLAST searches against a local database and GenBank. A limited number of closely related species could not be discriminated from each other in this analysis (e.g. S. salivarius and S. vestibularis). Most of these pairs could be separated to correct species level by sequence analysis of a second region in the same PCR fragment, the P9 region.",15.672885016578391,7.78348789174585

Analysis demonstrated that the circulating strains of influenza included alternative minor lineages that could provide genetic variation for the dominant strain. This may allow a novel strain to emerge within a human host and would explain the unexpected emergence of the Fujian influenza strain in 2003-2004 that resulted in a vaccine mismatch. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of full genomic sequences for providing new information on influenza viruses and lend further support for the need for large-scale influenza sequencing and the availability of sequence data in the public domain. Within the influenza community, public availability of influenza sequence data and sharing of strains has been an important issue.

Genome-wide studies have the advantage that no supposition is made about the genes involved, and potentially novel or unconsidered genes may be identifi ed. Typically, the genome-wide approach has used linkage studies of multiply aff ected (or infected) pedigrees to identify regions of the entire genome that are transmitted from the parents to the off spring more often than expected under independent inheritance. 43 Typically, aff ected sibling pairs, 57, 58 or larger multicase pedigrees 59 if available, are recruited and the inherited regions of the genome are defi ned by a few hundred microsatellite markers. The main disadvantages of linkage studies are that suffi cient numbers of aff ected sibling pairs may be diffi cult to recruit for many infections, and that linkage studies are often too insensitive to pick up the relatively small contributions from individual genetic regions that are typical of complex diseases such as infection. There are examples of successful genome scans undertaken using linkage analysis for infectious diseases, including the intensity of infection with Schistosoma mansoni, 59 susceptibility to H pylori, 60 and to leprosy. 57, 58, 61 As with association data, some linkage studies have not been replicated in diff erent populations. In some cases this may represent a false discovery rate, an inherent problem in studies that make multiple statistical comparisons, but it is increasingly clear that many complex diseases show genetic heterogeneity, with diff erent genetic determinants for the same disease operating in diff erent ethnic groups. For example, mutations in the NOD2/CARD15 locus, an important susceptibility determinant of infl ammatory bowel disease in white populations, are eff ectively absent in Asian populations with the same phenotype. 62 Genome-wide association studies, in which the whole genome is interrogated using hundreds of thousands of SNPs, have recently become a reality as genotyping technology and analytical tools evolve.

With its untargeted approach to sequencing, clinical metagenomics can cross disciplines in a way that clinical microbiology struggles to -identifying viral, bacterial, fungal and other eukaryotic pathogens in a single assay 11 and coupling pathogen detection to pathogen discovery. Given the current high cost of the technique -conservatively estimated at several thousand dollars -it is most often used when dealing with potentially lethal infections that fail the conventional diagnostic paradigm, such as the recent diagnosis of an unusual case of meningoencephalitis caused by the amoeboid parasite Balamuthia man drillaris 12 or the diagnosis and treatment of neuroleptospirosis in a critically unwell teenager 13 . In the latter case, despite a high index of suspicion for infection, Leptospira santa rosai was not detected by culture or PCR, as the diagnostic primer sequences were eventually found to be a poor match to the genome of the pathogen. Intravenous antibiotic therapy resulted in rapid recovery. In such an example, the costs are easily justified, particularly when offset against the cost of a stay in an intensive treatment unit. However, routine diagnostic metagenomics is currently limited to a handful of clinical research laboratories worldwide; it is therefore regarded as a 'test of last resort' and kept in reserve for vexing diagnostic conundrums. Substantial practical challenges hinder the adoption of metagenomics for diagnostics (FIG. 2) (reviewed in depth in REF. 11) . Chief among these is analytic sensitivity, which depends on pathogen factors (for example, genome size, ease of lysis and life cycle); analytic factors (for example, the completeness of reference databases and the potential to mistake a target for a close genetic relative); and sample factors (for example, pathogen abundance within a sample and contaminating background DNA). As an example of a problematic sample, during Zika surveillance, attempts to perform un targeted metagenomics sequencing on blood yielded few, or in some cases zero, reads owing to low viral titres 14 . Targetenrichment technologies (reviewed in REF. 15 ) such as bait probes can be employed, but even these were unsuccessful at recovering whole Zika genomes, necessitating PCR enrichment 14 . In addition to sensitivity, universal pathogen detection through clinical metagenomics is complicated by specificity issues arising from misclassification or contaminated reagents, the challenge of reproducing results from a complex clinical workflow, nucleic acid stability under varying assay conditions, ever-changing bioinformatics workflows and cost.",16.80786815092537,10.765543369272855

This triangular pattern suggests that NN sequences factor prominently in identifying regions of the genome that are unique to the target species. In fact, conservation among strains of variola and among strains of vaccinia enabled us to generate a reasonable list of signature candidates with only a single target sequence, as long as four NN sequences were available to eliminate nonunique regions (Table  1 ). NN sequences also facilitated signature generation for other double-stranded DNA viruses but not nearly to the extent as for variola and vaccinia.

To test for modularity, we further developed sensors and primer sets for the detection of PVY, and confirmed function with the same assay (Figure 1c ). The specificity of our system was also tested by interrogating the crosstalk between the product of various RPA reactions and noncognate molecular sensors.

We next interrogated the inherent limit of detection of our system through titration of input IVT products (Figure 1e ) and found it to be between 44pM and 4.4pM of input IVT RNA material.

We performed simulations, based on existing sequence data, to assess the number of genome sequences of a target species and of close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors) that are required to predict diagnostic signature regions that are conserved among strains of the target species and unique relative to other bacterial and viral species. For DNA viruses such as variola (smallpox), three target genomes provide sufficient guidance for selecting species-wide signatures. Three nearneighbor genomes are critical for species specificity. In contrast, most RNA viruses require four target genomes and no near-neighbor genomes, since lack of conservation among strains is more limiting than uniqueness. Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola Zaire are exceptional, as additional target genomes currently do not improve predictions, but near-neighbor sequences are urgently needed. Our results also indicate that double-stranded DNA viruses are more conserved among strains than are RNA viruses, since in most cases there was at least one conserved signature candidate for the DNA viruses and zero conserved signature candidates for the RNA viruses.",20.338522844579273,9.302270344469209

The relatively small Cryptosporidium genome (9.1-9.2 Mb) combined with ever-reducing sequencing costs will allow more Cryptosporidium genomes to be sequenced, and from different species and from multiple isolates of the same species [57] . Publication of new genomes will allow detailed comparisons, resulting in identification of more species-specific markers, polymorphic mini-and micro-satellite markers, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [58] . These markers can be exploited to develop improved PCR-based diagnostics utilising the more informative parts of the Cryptosporidium genome [16] . The SNPs may also be used in attempts to identify virulence genes or factors involved in host-specificity [58] . The increasing amount of genomic data will undoubtedly lead to further development of microarrays for detecting variation within parasite populations. However, this is a longer-term development and currently there is much focus on the use of mini-and micro-satellite markers. Generally, these are very variable because they are commonly in noncoding regions of the genome and are subject to fewer functional restraints that impede the accumulation of mutations. However, many Cryptosporidium satellite markers were identified before genome sequences became available, and are mostly within coding regions [59] .

A well-planned investment in bioinformatics capabilities will undoubtedly become the norm in any team pursuing virus population questions,0.2522805762766885,2.8964247703552246,3.23079776763916,cc165791-5da8-4426-be9d-0ccd35aa89fe,custom_license/Large-scale sequencing and the natural history of model human RNA viruses NIH Public Access Author Manuscript Large-scale molecular epidemiology of emerging & circulating RNA viruses,"Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of globally circulating emerging viruses, like dengue and influenza, continue to clarify our understanding of the genetic diversity and viral evolution of pathogens that are responsible every year for high rates of human morbidity and mortality on a global scale. These broad studies illustrate the power of genomics to vastly increase our overall knowledge of viral epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics, which are central to understanding viral ecology. We have observed how largescale sequencing has answered questions on the global circulation and reassortment of influenza viruses; on dengue virus serotype emergence; and on intrahost diversity in acute infections. We have also seen the value of metagenomic applications in virus discovery. But while NextGen platforms have simultaneously increased our throughput and decreased the costs per base pair, as compared with first-generation sequencing workflows, if we are to take full advantage of the developments in sequencing technologies, a number of variables will have to be optimized to achieve better results. One of the crucial parameters affecting the quality and detection sensitivity of NextGen sequencing is the purification of virions and viral nucleic acids from samples, particularly when dealing with clinical specimens where quantity is an issue and amplification of nucleic acids is necessary. Another is the limitation of short-read length, which on the SOLiD and Illumina HiSeq averages between 50-100 bases, as compared with Sanger-based sequencing, which can routinely give read lengths above 800 bases. This has severe limitations for the identification of coevolving or linked mutations on the same molecule when the nucleotide positions of interest are separated by a distance that exceeds the sequence read length. These are relevant in viral transmission studies, where a clear picture of the true genetic diversity of the virus population is necessary. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of these sequencing technologies is responsible for generating ever-growing volumes of data. As an example, for the determination of intrahost genetic diversity of 50 multiplexed influenza A virus samples, an eighth of a HiSeq2000 sequence run would typically generate 13-15 GB of sequence data; for efficient analysis, 64 GB of RAM and 3 TB of disk space would be required. Significant bioinformatics resources and infrastructure solely dedicated to data management, analyses and tool development are required for nearly all NextGen sequencing platforms, and this presents another challenge within this dynamic, fast-paced field. A well-planned investment in bioinformatics capabilities will undoubtedly become the norm in any team pursuing virus population questions that can only be addressed with NextGen technologies. As advancements in sequencing continue to be made, and biologists learn to exploit the deluge of data generated, NextGen sequencing stands poised to make even more contributions to the ever-growing exploration of the microbial world.",19.492751623864255,10.80515771804884

The only exception is the srpRNA, where the program misses more than 50% inserted sequence segments in one of the experiments. The relatively lower sensitivity in that particular experiment can be partly ascribed to the fact that the pseudoknot structure of srpRNA contains fewer nucleotides; thus, its structural and sequence patterns have larger probability to occur randomly. The running time for srpRNA, however, is also significantly shorter than that needed by most of other RNA pseudoknots due to the smaller size of the model. Additionally, while alpha−RBS pseudoknot has a more complex structure and three CM components are needed to model it, our searching algorithm efficiently identifies more than 95% of the inserted pseudoknots with high specificities. Our results demonstrate that higher C+G concentration in the background does not adversely affect the specificity of the model. The program achieves better overall performance in both sensitivity and specificity on the background of higher C+G concentrations. We therefore conjecture that the specificity of the model is partly determined by the base composition of the genome and can be improved if the base composition of the target gene is considerably different from its background.",17.01766662352573,10.147004071808377

Therefore re-sequencing of this genome should be straightforward given a complete and error free read set. Re-sequencing by hybridization using probes of around 25 nt is now a reasonably well established technology and has been reported for the SARS Coronavirus (22) . Other viral genomes we have analysed show similar trends (data not shown). As the genome is very short and contains very few repeats it is also possible to reassemble the genome of l-phage phage from short reads. Our analysis shows that it is possible to completely reassemble the genome from 18 nt reads and that 17 nt reads can cover 99.6% of the genome with contigs larger than 10 000 nt. Below this read length, coverage falls dramatically. This confirms and extends the result of Chaisson et al.

RNA viruses show a high degree of sequence diversity between different genotypes; and there is rapid evolution of quasi-species, by mutation and recombination, and the generation of reassortant genomes in the case of segmented genomes. These are major problems for the development of siRNA-based gene therapies [33] . In addition, large sections of highly structured, untranslated regions of viral RNA genomes are resistant to PTGS [33] . A few siRNAs even enhance expression instead of having a silencing effect. Others have an off-target effect and therefore silence the wrong genes [6, 63, 64] . SiRNAs may also cross-react with targets of limited similarity [63] . Escape mutants have emerged after treatment of cells with a single virus-specific siRNA, in particular when cells are infected at high MOI [15, 65, 66] . The design of multiple siRNAs targeting different regions of the viral genome, in particular wellconserved regions, reduces the probability of generating escape mutants. In addition, some studies have shown that transfection with siRNAs results in IFN-mediated activation of the Jak-Stat pathway and general upregulation of IFNstimulated genes [67, 68] . The effect was mediated by dsRNAdependent protein kinase, PKR, and depended on the concentration of siRNAs [68] . Bridge et al. [67] also noted that some shRNAs produced by a lentiviral vector induced an IFN response, whereas homologous chemically synthesized siR-NAs did not. However, some synthetic siRNAs do induce an IFN response [68] . SiRNAs caused Toll-like receptor 3 to induce type 1 IFN and sequence-independent mRNA degradation in the course of acute HSV-1 infection of keratinocytes [69] . It is therefore recommended to use the lowest effective dose of siRNAs or siRNA-encoding vectors [67] [68] [69] .",16.719151640883112,7.780832829806068

It has also been instrumental in the detection of emerging viruses. Over the past 20 years there has been a move to enhance diagnostic capability using more conventional diagnostic tests such as ELISA, serology and virus isolation, by the introduction of molecular-based testing as an adjunct to these tests rather than replacing them. Molecular diagnostics involve the detection of specific nucleic acids and frequently the amplification of these sequences in order to allow the products to be easily detected and as such are not reliant on the viability of the virus. This is both advantageous in that generic tests can be applied where no virus isolation methodology exists (or no means to identify the virus either through a cytopathic effect or immunologically once propagated in cells-i.e., lack of monoclonal antibodies) but may also identify samples as containing dangerous pathogens when in fact the virus is nonviable and therefore presents no threat. A further benefit of these approaches is the generation of DNA samples from which the sequence of the virus under investigation can be derived and used to identify the disease-causing agent.

We used two complementary panels of oligonucleotide probes targeted against representative common respiratory viruses as a proof of concept. They are (1) virus-specific probes that span the full genome of common respiratory viruses, and (2) conserved viral group probes that target against conserved regions from each of nine viral families or subfamilies that are associated with respiratory diseases. The virus-specific probes allow for full genome sequencing, which contributes to a more complete and confident identification and characterization of target viruses. The conserved viral group probes enable detection of divergent viruses with the potential to recognize novel viruses within these known viral families.

This heterogeneity makes complete theorisation difficult to achieve. Second, there might be no view of health, and thus health capabilities, that is ideal for all evaluative purposes; therefore, the pragmatism of the incomplete ordering of the capability approach and the incompletely theorised agreement on that ordering of the incomplete theorisation approach allows for reasoned public-policy decision-making in the face of multiple, and even conflicting, views on health. Third, there could be no single quantitative scale for comparing health capabilities and the inequalities in them; deviations in individuals' capability for functioning may occur in different domains of health capability that may not be quantifiably comparable. For example, one cannot quantifiably compare one individual's inability to hear or see with another's inability to bear children or to walk. These reductions in individuals' capabilities for functioning are qualitatively different and different people will have widely diverging views on which functional capability reduction is better or worse than the other. Thus, a framework for articulating and agreeing upon a conception of health functioning for prioritising health goods and services is required.

Cellular systems, such as the light-emitting B cells engineered by the Rider group [19] , while individually not having the parallel capabilities of the array, provide an extremely rapid detection system.

Recombination is a well-known phenomenon in enterovirus evolution. Our present findings are in line with a previous study demonstrating that several recombination breakpoints were located within the P2 and P3 regions of enteroviruses of same species, while no breakpoint was found within the P1 region by genomic analysis [30] . Other studies have also shown recombination sites located within non-structural regions, such as 2A in EV11/EV19 [24] , 2B in coxsackievirus B4 [22] , and 2C in echovirus 9/18 [2] . One possible reason for frequent detection of recombination sites within non-structural regions of the enterovirus genome is that non-structural regions are more homologous than capsid regions among enteroviruses of the same species. Instead, mutation rather than recombination frequently occurred in the capsid region of enteroviruses, particularly in VP1, which bears most of the motifs essential for interaction with antibodies and the host-cell receptor, and these result from evasion of host immune attack. The combination of mutations in the P1 region and recombination in the P2 and P3 regions of the enterovirus genome is probably important for the generation of the high diversity of enteroviruses circulating in the human population.

It is a simple and costeffective approach, and it is the only approach not requiring reference sequences. Instead, the other two HTS approaches, target enrichment and amplicon sequencing, both depend on reference information to design baits or primers.

Finally, the PCR amplicon sequencing is a wellestablished method consisting in specific viral genome amplification by PCR before sequencing. It is easily applicable on large number of samples in a routine use and so very adequate for clinical samples. The PCR amplification method, compared to the others, is particularly relevant for samples containing very low viral genetic material, it presents several disadvantages, though. The sequence of the virus of interest has to be known and not too variable to be correctly amplified by the set of designed primers. A second pitfall is due to the fact that the PCR cycles can introduce some amplification errors along the sequence which make the assembly step more prone to mistakes.

During viral outbreaks, molecular diagnosis methods as real-time RT/PCR allow identifying the pathogen and eventually the index case of the outbreak. However, the outbreak investigation must also determine clusters of patients and the pathway of the dissemination of the causative agent to stop the viral dissemination. Until now, Sanger sequencing method is used to obtain partial sequence of viral genome necessary to identify clusters of cases. However, many technical limitations, especially the small amount of viral genome in the biological samples, make this approach not very effective for the management of the outbreak. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies provide the possibility to rapidly obtain the full sequence of pathogen genomes. Notably whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of viruses is a powerful tool for the development of novel treatments and vaccines, for studying virus evolution and genetic association to diseases or for tracking outbreaks.

The depth of the sequencing data and the quality of the obtained sequences make this tool particularly efficient in this context. However, despite the relative small size of virus genomes, their sequencing often remains difficult. The small amount of virus genetic material compare to the host nucleic acid decreases viral sequencing output. In addition, one have to deal with the difficulty that several viral variants coexist in a single sample, presenting more or less variable sequences depending on the intrinsic mutation rate of the virus. All these points burden the sequencing and the assembly of viral genome. Today, numerous hospital laboratories have immediate access to HTS methods but the bioinformatics analysis remains difficult without bioinformatics skills. Consequently developing effective and easy-to-use protocols is a new challenge for the spreading of HTS methods as tools to investigate viral outbreaks in hospital.",22.683852957487908,10.89149158436088

In social network analysis there are several formal definitions, with the most common being related to the simplest possible relationship that fulfils the following concept: the number of triangles in a social network (individuals A, B, and C mutually connected) divided by the number of triples in a social network (A connected to B connected to C, but A need not be connected to C). Competent host: a species that can be infected by a pathogen and also transmit it. Denominator data: data that describes the composition of a host population, irrespective of the transmission of an infectious disease. This may include the population number or density, the characteristics of individuals, and the connections between them (e.g., friendship networks or movements of individuals between subpopulations). By contrast, numerator data describe the characteristics of the infected population. Forensic epidemiology: the science of identifying the characteristics of particular infectious disease outbreaks, in particular as they relate to control and eradication, and for which tracing between individuals is an important component. High-throughput sequencing: the technological revolution that followed the Sanger sequencing technology that was used to generate the first complete human genome, allowing for mass generation of sequences at increasingly affordable costs. Currently broadly subdivided into next-or second-generation sequencing (Illumina or 454) and now third generation (PacBio). Horizontal genetic transfer: the transfer of genetic material between organisms in a manner other than traditional reproduction (see also recombination and reassortment). Maintenance host: a host species in which a pathogen can persist -for practical purposes -indefinitely, including if necessary through the mechanism of a vector species (e.g., mosquitoes for malaria). Mathematical models: a term for quantitative models of disease transmission using mathematical formulae. Usually implying a mechanistic interpretation, with often non-linear transmission dynamics. There are a wide range of usages within this definition, ranging from the highly restrictive (deterministic models with compact mathematical formulations and preferably analytical solutions) to the catholic (that also incorporate purely individual-based simulations). Monophyletic: a disease outbreak caused by a single external source. By contrast, a polyphyletic outbreak arises from more than one external source. Orthogonal processes: two or more processes where the variation in each is statistically independent from the other. For example, beyond their most recent common ancestor, two genealogies are orthogonal provided they do not swap genetic material (e.g., through recombination). Reassortment: the exchange of genetic information via the transfer of genomic segments, as occurs in influenza. It is a special case of recombination with fixed breakpoints. Recombination: the exchange of genetic material between two pathogens, resulting in the inclusion of material from one into the other and the production of a 'mosaic' genome. Relative mutation rate: the mean rate at which mutations accumulate divided by the mean time between consecutive generations of infected individuals. This is an indicator of the likelihood that there will be polymorphisms that are informative for tracing between individuals, but also the likelihood that there will be observable differences between the sampled genealogies and the transmission genealogies. Reservoir host: a species (usually assumed to be wildlife) that is a maintenance host for a pathogen. Social network: a form of denominator data, describing a population or populations in terms of the individuals hosts (nodes or equivalently in graph theory, vertices) and the associations between them (links, equivalently edges). Social network analysis includes descriptions of clustering which can introduce ambiguities into tracing. Spillover host: a species that is neither a maintenance host nor is necessary to maintain the pathogen in combination with other host species. Synonymous mutation: the replacement of a nucleotide by another that does not cause a change in the amino acid sequence after translation. Transmission network: a form of numerator data, the complete tree of 'who infected whom' in an outbreak. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS): the process that uses high-throughput sequencing to describe the entire genome of an organism. Because there are always errors or unknown regions in any genome reconstruction, it is more correctly 'nearly-whole' genome sequencing.",17.857947464776693,10.879483966626157

This still leaves substantial numbers of neutral or 'nearly neutral' mutations (i.e., sites subject to only weak selection) [13] . Although such nearly neutral variation may be selected out over longer time scales [14, 15] , over shorter time scales such as a single epidemic they can be useful markers of pathogen genealogy, provided that phenotypic effects [16] are minimal. These mutations will not necessarily be synonymous because there may be constraints imposed by genetic structure (e.g., RNA secondary structure) and overlapping reading frames (i.e., a synonymous mutation on one frame can be nonsynonymous and selected against in the other) [17] . Polymorphisms in sets of sequences can be compromised by technical issues, including errors in sequencing and bioinformatics, resulting in missed or artefactually added mutations), by reassortment in segmented genomes such as in influenza viruses, and by recombination in non-segmented genomes such as those of retroviruses or bacteria [18, 19] .",18.30344738263969,9.302619969791962

As part of the laboratory pipeline, direct screening of extracts can be performed by PCR (quantitative (qPCR) or conventional) against species-specific genes, as done previously 17, 61, 63, 64 . PCR techniques alone, however, can suffer from frequent false-positive results and should therefore always be coupled with further verification methods such as downstream genome enrichment and/or next-generation sequencing (NGS) in order to ensure ancient DNA (aDNA) authentication of putatively positive samples.

In addition, data produced by direct (shotgun) sequencing of NGS libraries before enrichment can also be used for pathogen screening using computational tools. After pre-processing, reads can be directly mapped against a target reference genome (in cases for which contextual information is suggestive of a causative organism) or against a multigenome reference composed of closely related species to achieve increased mapping specificity of ancient reads. Alternatively , ancient pathogen DNA can also be detected using metagenomic profiling methods, as presented elsewhere 41, 71, 72 , through taxonomic assignment of shotgun NGS reads. Both approaches allow for subsequent assessment of aDNA authenticity and can be followed by whole pathogen genome retrieval through targeted enrichment or direct sequencing of positive sample libraries. detection 66 , whereby probes are designed to represent unique or conserved regions from a range of pathogenic bacteria, parasites or viruses.

Both approaches utilize dense SNP maps to find individual SNP sites that are significantly associated with phenotypic variation in the trait of interest, with associated SNPs being described by the increased risk of a disease outcome they confer. GWAS, as their name implies, are designed to screen the whole genome for genetic variants that contribute to variation in a phenotype within a population. For these studies, once data on variation in a phenotypic trait have been collected from a population, genome-wide SNP maps from these same individuals are used to conduct association analysis. These genome scans statistically test whether specific regions of the genome are significantly associated with variation in a phenotype. If the test population is sufficiently large and importantly the SNP map is sufficiently dense, for some phenotypes, it is possible to identify the specific polymorphisms (e.g., SNPs, insertions, or deletions) that are responsible for driving the phenotypic variation. In contrast, candidate gene studies are designed to test whether variation in a specific gene or genetic element is associated with variation in a specific phenotype. For this type of candidate analysis, target SNPs, which are likely to impact expression and or function of the gene, are tested for a statistically significant association with a phenotype of interest.",17.177542778389327,9.147548660027818

Treatment with either IFN-a or IFN-c or both at the same time failed to abolish replication of the virus in the transformed cells. Upon i.p. administration in mice, the modified vaccinia vector localized to subcutaneous tumors with greater specificity than its WT counterpart, while vector titers in peripheral organs were reduced compared to WT virus.

Besides whole genome sequencing, ChIP-Seq, or Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation-Sequencing, is another approach to address mutations in functional non-transcribed regions of the genome. This technology sequences the genomic regions bound by transcription factors or other DNA-binding proteins (such as histones), and provides information on the position of these binding sites as well as possible mutations in these sites. The binding site profiles of multiple transcription factors, as well as the identified sequence variations within, may act as new markers for diseases such as leukemia [8, 73] . Sono-Seq is a related technology developed in our lab, which parallel sequences sonicated formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin DNA via Illumina sequencing, and identifies the chromatin regions that are open and accessible (nucleosome-free therefore susceptible to sonication) [6] . With this technology we identified multiple highly accessible chromatin regions including actively transcribed promoter regions as well as the CTCF insulator protein binding sites.

Genomic DNA sequencing provides rich information on genetic variations (such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, insertions and deletions) and structural variations (such as copy number variations, transposition and transloca-tion) of the investigated genomes and is a powerful tool to reveal novel disease-associated markers. Genome sequencing can also detect integrated viral sequences which may help address studies of virus-associated diseases. Whole genome sequencing has already been applied in organisms with small genomes, such as Acinetobacter baumannii [96] , Toxoplasma gondii [12] , and Drosophila melanogaster [77] , however, due to the large size of human genome and the high cost of parallel sequencing, human whole genome sequencing is still in its infancy.

Due to the unbiased nature of the sequencing methods, they were able to use read frequency to establish how rates of mutations vary within the cancer tissue. This concept is important for future works as we seek to understand the progression of mutational events that lead to the development of diseases like cancer. The researchers found that 59,209 single nucleotide variations were unique in the cancer tissue sample. These mutations resulted in changes to the coding regions in ten genes, two of which were previously implicated in cancer. Nonetheless, as sequencing costs continue to decrease with the maturation of the platforms, whole genome sequencing of larger sample sets is shedding light on new venues of genetic and genomic marker identification in various diseases.

Thus, siRNAs need to be directed against well-conserved target sites. Unfortunately, simply directing siRNAs to protein coding regions is insufficient, since silent mutations can cause the siRNAs to lose their inhibitory potential. Target regions with an important function in the structure of the RNA may prove to be a better choice to avoid viral escape. It has, for example, been shown that an siRNA against the highly conserved cis-acting replication element (CRE) was capable of inhibiting various enteroviruses over a long period, while an siRNA targeted against protein-encoding regions of the RNA, which are not organized into functional three dimensional structures, led to rapid viral escape (8) . Since even the most careful selection of a single target site might be insufficient for sustained viral silencing, use of multiple siRNAs against multiple target sites may be necessary to prevent viral escape. In the case of coxsackievirus B3 and HIV-1, resistance rapidly emerged when single molecules were used, but a combination of three or four siRNAs, respectively, targeting distinct regions of the genome, were able to prevent the emergence of resistance (9, 10) .",30.303445510446856,12.625919187399685

Numbers of sequence reads generated per run has progressively increased with time, due to improved understanding of molecular biology as well as technological advances. Current sequencing platforms are capable of generating enormous numbers of sequence reads in quick turnaround time, allowing researchers to explore all possible aspects of biomedical studies at molecular level and dig deeper in the genetic aspects. NGS has proven to be an efficient, fast and reliable approach to solve problems in studies of evolution, ecology and genetics, overcoming the limitation of traditional molecular approaches [22] . Another great advantage of NGS approach over traditional molecular studies is that it is also cost efficient. End-to-end human genome can be sequenced in few hours using NGS technology, whereas, it took over a decade to sequence and assemble human genome using Sanger Sequencing. Based upon the chemistry, a number of NGS platforms have been developed since last decade. Bioinformatics knowledge plays an important role in assembling the fragments sequenced in parallel by mapping all the read sequences to the human genome reference. Depth of the sequencing, i.e. number of times the template has been sequenced, assures accuracy of sequencing, making sure that observed variation in sequenced data is the result of mutations, and not of sequencing errors. NGS can be used to sequence targeted regions identified in a genetic study, or entire genome including all coding genes (whole exome sequencing). The variations in human genome can be a few nucleotide base changes (substitutions), insertions, and deletions of DNA, large genomic deletions of exons or whole genes and rearrangements such as inversions and translocations. All these anomalies are collectively termed 'mutations'. Traditional methods of sequencing were only able to discover handfuls of mutations including small insertions and deletions. This led to the development of dedicated assays, to discover additional types of variations. Some of the examples includes fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for conventional karyotyping, or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarrays to detect sub-microscopic chromosomal copy number changes such as microdeletions.",19.095186646337897,11.709474779610293

Previous investigations of probe design relied on limited sets of probes to examine individual parameters and often hybridize artificial samples such as PCR products [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The results from the current study were derived from more then 300,000 probes using complex biological samples and a global SNP set for HB3/Dd2/3D7 derived from their genome sequences. We observe very high specificity, however our chip optimized for CNP was not sensitive for whole-genome level SNP detection. Because our study comprehensively evaluated SNPs, without pre-selecting for favorable characteristics, it was possible to assess the probe features that dictate sensitivity and specificity. We define the probe parameters that define the degree to which point mutations can be assayed reliably. Our analysis differs from, but compliments the recent study by Jiang et al. which used the Affymetrix PFSANGER microarray with over 2.2 million P. falciparum probes to focus on SNP detection in a set of 2651 SNPs reporting 81% sensitivity [11] . Together, these studies demonstrate that gene chips can carefully target ""high quality SNPs"" to provide very high sensitivity and specificity that will be necessary for high-resolution genome-wide association studies. Sensitivity for SNP genotyping by hybridization is compounded by the high AT content of the P. falciparum genome. For example, sensitivity was better in coding regions, reflecting the relatively low sequence complexity and repetitive stretches in intergenic regions. Decreased probe density in subtelomeric regions and polymorphic multigenic families illustrate the challenge of assaying these regions using tiling and resequencing arrays, just as they are not amenable to PCR applications or assembly following shotgun sequencing. Probe performance parameters have been evaluated for gene expression applications [26] , however in gene expression studies, sensitivity refers to the ability to detect the relative abundance of transcripts to minimize the impact of sequence polymorphisms on hybridization signals. Conversely in CGH applications used to identify SFPs, sensitivity refers to the ability to detect small polymorphisms through their impact on hybridization signal. This distinction is important because relatively long probes increase transcript detection sensitivity in gene expression arrays, and also CNP detection in gDNA, but decrease polymorphism detection sensitivity in CGH arrays.",18.723881539883532,11.541890462253303

Expensiveness is always a matter of consideration when any diagnostic assay or kit is developed. At present whole-genome sequencing technologies particularly the next-generation sequencing (NGS) are very costly, but as per the increasing demand and use in different field of scientific research, diagnostics and many others, it can be expected to become cheaper in the future.

An optimal target will also have minimal off-target effects, just as an ideal small molecule pharmaceutical will have minimal interactions with targets beyond those therapeutically desired (39). Checking for sequence homology between the target and the host genome can minimize these effects.

This probe size range is optimal for detection of CNPs but is considerably longer than has been described for SFP genotyping. Each probe corresponded to a unique sequence that occurred only once in the entire reference genome with a 48 bp median probe spacing and an 8 bp median probe overlap. Probe coverage on this array represented 69.4% of the nucleotides in the complete reference genome and 77.7% of nucleotides in genes.

In particular, for next-generation sequencing no prior knowledge is needed with respect to the suspected etiological agent and researchers do not have to perform preliminary identification using traditional serological or molecular diagnostic methods. Although next-generation sequencing has advantages over routine diagnostics, it has not been widely used for surveillance of pathogenic microbes. The major reasons for this include: first, high throughput sequencing data needs sophisticated computational processing and annotation, and, thus far, relatively few researchers with sufficient bioinformatics expertise engage in near-patient or disease surveillance activities. In addition, the potential causative agent usually has many sequence reads, particularly if an isolate or a sample type enriched in the pathogen is available, which renders diagnosis and confirmation relatively straightforward. However, if there is only a limited number of sequence reads covering the true etiological agent, it is far harder to identify without bioinformatics training. In either case, the real causative agent should fulfill Koch's postulates, and therefore confirmatory experiments are needed to validate the discoveries made by next-generation sequencing. Second, the whole process, including sample treatment, data processing and annotation needs standardization, which is extremely important for clinicians when a diagnosis based on high throughput sequencing data is required to guide treatment. Third, the cost of next-generation sequencing is still high, including library construction, patterned flow cells, DNA sequencing platforms and high performance computer servers. Finally, routine next-generation sequencing process is currently still relatively laborious and time-consuming, usually requiring a few days from sample receipt, which is unsuitable for emergent cases.

Development of these antiviral drugs gained from the advances in molecular and structural biology coupled with advances in medicinal chemistry and in the industrialization of the drug discovery process. The SARS epidemic has emphasized the need to develop drugs against emerging viral infections quickly, and demonstrates the usage of genomic technologies in antiviral research. In the past two decades, biology has become an information-driven science as a result of the emergence of genomic technologies and the expansion of the Internet that allows analysis of genomic databases at every researcher's desktop. These advanced genomic technologies led to rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV [5, 6] and, for the first time in history, the sequencing of a genome of an infective agent preceded the understanding of its basic biology and etiology. Armed with this genomic information, research groups around the world suggested multidisciplinary approaches to attain anti-SARS drugs. In general, physicians tried to relieve the symptoms mainly by modulating parts of the immune system, while vaccinologists began the long process of developing a vaccine against the virus. Molecular and structural biologists suggested ways to interfere with the viral life cycle, and these are the focus of this review (Figure 1 ). The strategy starts from virus identification, goes through genome sequencing and, hopefully, ends with an antiviral drug. Drug development remains a challenge, but the acceleration in drug discovery offered by genome technologies will hopefully enable significant timetable cuts in achieving antiviral medicine. Other, more classical anti-viral strategies used to treat SARS patients, like the use of interferon, will not be discussed here. The interested reader is referred to [7, 8] .

Two design services have been developed to fill the niche for antiviral RNAi therapy design. siVirus is a web-based application that streamlines antiviral RNAi design by implementing several algorithms for creating functional siRNAs, targeting highly conserved regions of the virus, and considering potential off-target effects (52). Currently, the software has sequence data to identify highly conserved regions of HIV, SARS, HCV, and influenza, and as second and even third generation sequencing technologies lower the cost of large scale sequencing (53), the known genetic diversity of many viruses and the capabilities of siVirus will presumably grow. Another freely available piece of software specifically for viral siRNA design is CAPSID (54), which searches for active siRNAs with minimized potential off-target effects in highly conserved regions of the viral genome, with guidance from user-provided sample virus sequences. This flexibility means CAPSID is more widely applicable to different viruses; however, limited userprovided sequence data could bias the results.

Since different genes evolve at different rates, the DNA region selected should be sufficiently variable in sequence to allow the identification of parasites to the taxonomic level required. For specific identification, the target DNA should display no or minor sequence variation within a species and differ sufficiently in sequence to consistently allow the delineation among species. In contrast, for the purpose of identifying population variants ('strains' or genotypes), a considerable degree of variation in the sequence should exist within a species. A range of target regions in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes have been employed to achieve the identification of parasites to species or sub-specific genotypes (Anderson et al., 1998; Blouin, 2002; Chilton, 2004; Gasser, 2006) .

To define the minimal cis-acting 3 0 genomic element required for efficient PRRSV replication, progressive 3 0 deletions were introduced into self-limiting PRRSV replicons encoding an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-driven luciferase (LUC) reporter within the deleted region (Choi et al., 2006) . Only the smallest deletion, encoding the full M and N proteins, replicated to similar levels as the positive control. The next smallest deletion removing the M protein coding region but maintaining the complete N ORF resulted in significant loss of genome replication (Choi et al., 2006) . Taken together, including the RdRp, HEL, 5 0 UTR, 3 0 UTR, ORF6, ORF7, and other unknown viral proteins, these data show that key genetic elements or protein interacting partners are required for efficient PRRSV replication and transcription, and are interspersed within multiple coding regions of the genome.",15.717555979076437,8.97984881869375

Advances in molecular biological technologies have enabled the development of new, sensitive and specific diagnostic methods that have found applications in the field of veterinary parasitology. The ability to specifically identify and study parasites (irrespective of lifecycle stage) using such tools has provided new insights into parasite systematics, population genetics, ecology and epidemiology, and has important implications for the specific diagnosis, treatment and control of parasitic diseases (Gasser, 2006) . In particular, methods that rely on the enzymatic amplification of nucleic acids can overcome some of the limitations of traditional approaches (Gasser, 2006) . Techniques that employ the PCR (Mullis et al., 1986; Saiki et al., 1988) can selectively amplify in vitro target DNA sequences from complex genomes or matrices and have led to advances in many areas of the biological sciences. PCR involves the heat denaturation of doublestranded DNA, followed by a decrease in temperature to allow oligonucleotide primers to bind (¼anneal) to their complementary sequence on sense and antisense strands of the target template.

Without these pretreatment, determining the whole or partial genome sequence of the target virus would be difficult. Hence, the target enrichment system represents an important method for detection of target viral genomes in a mixture of nucleic acids derived from both host and infectious agents.

We compared the percent loci per protein that are variant in any sample between 1 and 2 dengue and found significantly fewer unique variant loci in 2 dengue cases, both in PBMC ( Figure 1A ; left panel, p < 0.001) and plasma ( Figure 1A ; right panel, p < 0.01) samples. These observations were not due to systematic disparities in the yields of viral RNA, since measures of genome equivalents (GE) per milliliter of extracted viral RNA were not significantly different between 1 and 2 cases for both PBMC and plasma samples ( Figure 1B ; left and right panels). Thus, DENV-3 appears to be evolving at fewer distinct loci genome-wide in 2 dengue compared with 1 dengue, suggesting that virus evolution is constrained by pre-existing immune pressures in 2 dengue. In addition, we examined the locations of unique variant loci on the exposed and membrane-associated surfaces of the E protein, which is a prominent target for antibody-mediated immunity in human dengue. We detected fewer unique variant loci across all samples in 2 dengue cases compared with 1 cases ( Figure 1C ; top and bottom panels) on both the exposed and the membraneassociated surfaces of E; much of this difference was contributed by PBMC-specific variant loci. Thus, consistent with genome-wide differences between 1 and 2 dengue, the breadth of the viral variant repertoire in E appears to be reduced in 2 dengue compared with 1 dengue. Such global differences in viral composition between naive individuals and individuals with pre-existing immunity to DENV indicate that the extent of diversity in the intrahost DENV-3 population is directed by the immune repertoire during acute dengue in humans. Further studies investigating particular epitopes will help resolve the specificities of pre-existing immune pressures contributing to differential rates of viral microevolution in 1 and 2 dengue.",17.42947605857421,9.559816396864345

Multiple copies of regions of the genome defined by specific oligonucleotide primers are made by repeated cycles of amplification under controlled conditions. Such methods can be used to study DNA from any source. Several variations on the PCR theme have been described, and use of these techniques continues to expand and develop. PCRmediated DNA fingerprinting makes use of the variable regions in DNA molecules. These may be variable numbers of tandem repeat regions or areas with restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. To perform PCR typing, it is necessary to know the sequences of the bordering regions so that specific oligonucleotide primers can be synthesized. Primers may be specific for a known sequence or be random. Random primers are extensively used in the techniques of random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR). Both of these approaches have problems with reproducibility as a result of false priming, faint versus sharp bands and variation in electrophoretic migration of products. Repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) indexes variation in multiple interspersed repetitive sequences in intergenic regions dispersed throughout the genome. An automated, standardized rep-PCR system has proven useful for strain typing of a number of species and is reported to give similar discrimination to PFGE (Bacterial Barcodes, Houston, Texas, USA). Amplified fragment length polymorphism is a DNA sequencebased technique that combines restriction endonuclease digestion with PCR.

Increasing numbers of dengue outbreaks and circulating serotypes have been seen in normally arid regions such as Saudi Arabia [13, 14] and parts of India [15, 16] . Ironically, in Australia there is concern that the reintroduction of Ae. aegypti to more southern locations will occur in the midst of a drought because of the human response of installing large domestic water storage tanks.

For RNA extraction, carrier poly(A) RNA is added to the lysis buffer to increase the yield. Because the PCR primers are specific to the SARS-CoV genome, the subsequent amplification would not be affected. However, if one wants to perform 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3' RACE) or similar cloning operation that depends on oligo(dT) priming of poly(A) tail of the viral RNA, then the carrier poly(A) RNA should be avoided. Yields of viral RNA should be determined by quantitative RT-PCR, because spectrophotometric determination is prone to error as a result of low RNA quantity and interference by the carrier poly(A) RNA, which contributes to most of the RNA present. 4. A prolonged denaturation step is used to remove secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV genome that impede reverse-transcription. The use of random hexamer ensures an even representation of the whole RNA genome and allows more sequence information to be obtained from a limited amount of viral RNA. 5. We recommend the use of a reverse transcriptase with increased thermal stability, which facilitates reverse-transcription at a higher temperature (55°C) than normal (42°C). This unfolds some of the secondary RNA structures, and thus produces longer cDNA at higher yields. 6. We recommend the simultaneous use of two different DNA polymerases in the PCR amplification. For example, the cDNA polymerase mix that we use contains KlenTaq-1 DNA polymerase, and a second DNA polymerase with 3' to 5' proofreading activity. The inclusion of a minor amount of a proofreading polymerase results in an error rate that is significantly lower than that for Taq alone (18). This advantage is obvious when one is concerned about genomic sequence variations between different viral strains. The use of a two-polymerase system also increases the efficiency and yield, and hence the sensitivity, which is important when the viral titer is suboptimal. 7. The carryover of unused PCR primers into the sequencing reaction would lead to poor sequencing results. Like the sequencing primers, these unused PCR primers would also bind nonspecifically to the sequencing template in the cycle sequencing reaction, and, hence, generate noisy sequencing traces overshadowing the intended traces. Purification of the PCR products is, thus, usually recommended prior to their use as sequencing templates. However, these methods are laborintensive and pose extra contamination risk, as they involve additional steps of opening and handling PCR products. Notably, we have suggested an optimized PCR protocol for direct sequencing of PCR products without PCR product purification. With the low PCR primer concentrations and the optimal number of cycles, most of the PCR primers are consumed at the end of the PCR. Furthermore, a nested sequencing primer selectively extends the specific PCR product in the cycle sequencing reaction. This would suppress any nonspecific PCR product from extension. The combined effect is a neat sequencing trace. 8. The amount of PCR product used for the sequencing reaction must be optimized carefully with different sequencing systems. Although more PCR product input usually gives higher signal intensities, it may also give shorter read lengths and oversaturated signals. 9 . The PCR primers target 50 700-bp amplicons that overlap with each other along the SARS-CoV genome. The sequencing primers are designed in such a way that any sequence masked over by the PCR primer binding sites and the sequencing primer peak on one amplicon are reliably backed up by the homologous sequence in the overlapping amplicon. 10. We advocate scrutinizing efforts in validating any genomic sequence variation by resequencing regions with different combination of primers and sequencing chemistry. Because variation seen in a single viral isolate could potentially be a result of sequencing artifacts, we consider only the genomic sequence variations that are shared by at least two SARS-CoV isolates.",16.887753836668125,8.662072745288219

The redox reaction catalyzed by the enzyme generates an electrical current which correlates with the level of hybridized mRNA. In contrast to former protocols in which probes were targeted to regions of the mRNA-target separated by a few hundred nucleotides, DNA-probes were, with this approach, adjacently bound to their target regions in the same mRNA molecule. The resulting enhancement of the hybridization efficiency may result from a cooperative effect of the adjacently bound probes (by modifications on the secondary structures of the mRNA molecule) [163] or from prevention of breaking or hydrolysis points that, otherwise, may occur along the structure of a mRNA strand in the case of separated probes. By using two instead of only one DG-labeled detection probe, further signal amplification was achieved, thus resulting in a substantial time reduction of the detection protocol. In addition, the expression profile exhibited by this optimized protocol is comparable with those of real-time RT-PCR assays. An alternative method proposed by Dubus et al., with optical detection, does not require the release of the hybridized target-DNA prior to its detection [164] ; instead, a polymeric polythiophene derivative was attached to a magnetic microbead-grafting ssDNA followed by hybridization with the DNA-analyte, with formation of triplex-branched beads. The detection principle relies on the different conformations adopted by the polymer molecule when electrostatically bound to either ssDNA or dsDNA, giving rise to distinct fluorescence properties (chromism). The other novelty of this work was the confinement of the particle-bound target-DNA in a small volume of a microelectromagnetic trap, which allows performing the preconcentration and the detection steps simultaneously on the same support, thus decreasing the final sample volume and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. This scheme not only avoids the hybridized DNA-releasing step, but also renders results in only 5 min, with detection limits similar to those of 'capture and release' methods. The above combination is able to extend the application of this ultrasensitive biosensor to biological samples with complex matrices and integration in lab-on-a-chip platforms.",16.129585813273554,8.375354290779777

Genomic DNA was randomly broken up into small fragments, which are sequenced to obtain reads. Multiple reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing amplification and sequencing. Then the reads were assembled into continuous sequences by computer programs. DNA reads generated by this type of metagenomic sequencing can be assembled into longer composite sequences by reads overlapping or even complete genomes, and could also be considered directly as environmental gene tags (EGTs), the short sequences from the DNA of microbial communities that contain fragments of functional genes. While such a vast amount of information can be produced from a metagenomic sample by WGS sequencing, suitable bioinformatics tools are still needed to, for example, reconstruct bacterial genomes, explore taxonomic diversity genome-wide, annotate genomes (and community metagenomes) in terms of functional composition, and carry out association studies between microbiome diversity and phenotypes.",24.00408068502628,10.927119439061872

Standard techniques, based on deriving consensus sequences, miss the presence of minor or subclonal variants (low-frequency polymorphisms) which might be important to understand the dynamics of viral populations as well as the evolution and spread of the disease. Next-generation sequencing techniques allow the detection of rare polymorphisms and minor variants and lead to consideration of infected hosts as viral populations rather than ""collections"" of the same consensus genome. Consequently, these methods provide a better view of viral diversity, which enables an improvement in the study of the epidemiology and evolution of human viruses. A more widespread use of these technologies to characterize genome variation will provide increased information about the intra-host dynamics and the relationship between viral diversity and infection outcome (Liu et al. 2012; Farci et al. 2000) , the inter-host transmission and dynamics (reservoirs for better-transmitted variants), the development of resistance and the failure of antiviral treatments, and the building of highly resolved phylogenies and transmission histories during epidemic outbreaks. In addition, advances in sequencing technologies have also allowed the fast and in-depth analysis of complete genomes. The evolution and accumulation of genetic variation occur differently and simultaneously throughout the genome. Separate regions of the same genome can interact with each other (epistasis) and, even, evolve independently and show different phylogenetic histories.

This triangular pattern suggests that NN sequences factor prominently in identifying regions of the genome that are unique to the target species. In fact, conservation among strains of variola and among strains of vaccinia enabled us to generate a reasonable list of signature candidates with only a single target sequence, as long as four NN sequences were available to eliminate nonunique regions (Table  1 ). NN sequences also facilitated signature generation for other double-stranded DNA viruses but not nearly to the extent as for variola and vaccinia.

We performed simulations, based on existing sequence data, to assess the number of genome sequences of a target species and of close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors) that are required to predict diagnostic signature regions that are conserved among strains of the target species and unique relative to other bacterial and viral species. For DNA viruses such as variola (smallpox), three target genomes provide sufficient guidance for selecting species-wide signatures. Three nearneighbor genomes are critical for species specificity. In contrast, most RNA viruses require four target genomes and no near-neighbor genomes, since lack of conservation among strains is more limiting than uniqueness. Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola Zaire are exceptional, as additional target genomes currently do not improve predictions, but near-neighbor sequences are urgently needed.

The concept and capabilities to genetically target and modify almost any region in the genome rapidly engendered the development of transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology (Moscou and Bogdanove, 2009; Boch et al., 2009; Hockemeyer et al., 2011) , and in 2012-13 the development of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats CRISPR/Cas9) technology (Jinek et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013) . Such tools now allow the exquisite efficient manipulation of the genome (Gaj et al., 2013) . Here we briefly outline the basic commonalities and unique aspects of these approaches and their capabilities to create and improve humanized mouse models (Table 1) .",20.3019957381657,10.048938101863854

Microarray-based pathogen-detection platforms, such as the GreeneChip and the Virochip, 33-36 use 70-mer oligonucleotide probes of conserved genetic regions within each taxonomic group of viruses. Because of their length, these probes are more tolerant of sequence mismatches and therefore allow for the detection of unknown microbial targets. 37 Furthermore, the probes are updated continuously when new viruses and sequences are added to their associated databases. To identify a pathogen from a clinical specimen, nucleic acids are amplified randomly and then hybridized to the chips. Given the large number of probes and possible hybridization successes, the results are analyzed with the help of computer programs that use algorithms and statistics to identify virus hybridization patterns. Although microarray-based pathogendetection platforms have been instrumental in the detection of numerous pathogens, including novel ones like the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), 34,38 they still rely on some prior knowledge of relevant genome sequences. [39] [40] [41] The introduction of high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized the ability to detect novel infectious agents whose genomic sequences are completely unknown or are present in extremely low numbers. The highthroughput sequencing revolution started in 1987 with the introduction of the first automatic sequencer. 42 The first of the next-generation sequencing technologies was developed only a few years later, 43 but it took nearly 15 years of technologic improvements before it became commercially available. 44, 45 Currently, the most frequently used platforms of this type include the 454 large-scale parallel pyrosequencing system (454 Life Sciences/Roche, Branford, Conn) and the Solexa (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, Calif) sequencing-by-synthesis system, but this field is evolving rapidly with new platform generations regularly being developed. These techniques allow for the ''deep'' sequencing of clinical samples. The term ''deep'' refers to the depth of coverage or the average number of times that a single nucleotide is sequenced, and it allows for high levels of accuracy in sequence determination. [46] [47] [48] ''Deep'' sequencing methods can, therefore, achieve thousands to millions of simultaneous sequence reads per run, allowing for the precise determination of the entire genome of an organism. ''Ultra-deep'' sequencing, which is largely being enabled by platforms such as the 454 sequencing system, provides an even deeper sequence coverage and allows for several additional applications, including amplicon and transcript sequencing, which can detect extremely low-abundance genetic variations. 49 Because pyrosequencing techniques are based on the detection of light produced whenever a nucleotide is incorporated and do not rely on physical separation of DNA bases, these platforms can be run in parallel and miniaturized to any reaction volume that generates detectable levels of light, thus driving down the overall cost of sequencing. Nevertheless, the shorter reads necessitated by the deeper sequencing capacity of nextgeneration sequencing creates additional challenges for sequence assembly and gene annotation. 49 Although the cost of sequencing is decreasing, the analysis of the accumulated data is costly, time consuming, and computationally challenging. The analysis is complicated by the fact that computer systems will have to discriminate between the nucleic acids of the host and those of the newly discovered infectious agent. Despite these challenges, several new viruses have been identified using ''deep'' sequencing systems. [50] [51] [52] [53] Additionally, these systems have made subsequent steps in pathogen discovery, including sequencing the entire genome to '' Genomics is the study of the complete set of hereditary genetic information in an organism. With the advent of microarray technology and next-generation sequencing, numerous applications have arisen from the field of genomics, including pathogen discovery, epidemiologic advances, and a variety of molecular techniques that allow for precise manipulation of microbial genomes. As DNA begets RNA and protein, so do the fields of transcriptomics and proteomics follow logically from genomics. Transcriptomics, which is a subset of the field of genomics and concerns the collection of messenger RNA transcripts expressed within an organism, has emerged as a result of more sophisticated techniques that allow for the highly sensitive determination of low-abundance mutations, transcripts, and SNPs. Proteomics is the next major ''omics'' field after genomics, and it focuses on the complement of proteins, their modifications, and their interactions within an organism. With the aid of analytical techniques such as 2-DE, MS/MS, and shotgun proteomics, the field of proteomics has found useful application for the identification of biomarkers and mapping of epitopes that may provide targets for antimicrobial drug development. The field of metabolomics is a natural offshoot of proteomics as it uses many of the same MS techniques. A major difference, however, is that whereas genomics and proteomics provide insight into the potential of cellular processes, metabolomics gives an instantaneous snapshot of what is actually happening in a cell. Each one of these ''omics'' fields generates massive amounts of rich, detailed data that surpass the capabilities of manual data analysis. This therefore necessitates the incorporation of bioinformatics for the development of computer algorithms that are used to analyze and model data.

For example, in a study to characterize human influenza A(H3N2) circulating in Indonesia, to obtain complete coding sequence of HA and NA gene of the virus, specific primer sets had to be developed and further tested using Indonesian H3N2 virus samples (Agustiningsih et al., 2016) . In addition, in developing PCR-based assays for detection of pathogenic viruses, it is also of very important to take into account the high genetic diversity, especially among the RNA viruses -such as those from the Flaviviridae and Bunyaviridae families -and the potential of cross-reactivity among viruses with a close relative. To address these challenges, a bioinformatics workflow based on two consecutive basic local alignment search tool for nucleotide (BLASTn) steps has been developed and evaluated. This approach allows rapid selection of highly conserved and specific genomic regions among the complete taxon of viruses investigated to be used as candidates for molecular markers from which real-time PCR primer sets are generated (Schneeberger et al., 2017) . Similarly, a formulation of universal primer reagent based on a mixture of 10, 18-22-nucleotide PCR primers (5 primer pair groups) was developed for rapid and specific detection of many variants of Dengue viruses with high diagnostic sensitivity. The primer sequences of this so-called primer cocktail were computed such that their probability of mispriming with the host genome background, the human DNA, is extremely low. Initial experimental testing showed that the primers amplified the genome of Dengue viruses and not that of the human. In addition, based on computational testing against 291 strains of other non-dengue flaviviruses, the Dengue virus specificity of the primers were predicted to be very good. Specificity among DENV serotypes was also found to be very good. The primer cocktail was predicted by electronic-PCR to have an ability to detect 95% of the 1688 dengue strains (listed in the Broad Institute Dengue Virus Database) with perfect primer match. With reduced stringency which allows one mismatch and one insertion per primer, it was predicted that the primer cocktail is able to detect 99% of the Dengue virus strains analyzed. This strategy therefore provides a single-PCR diagnostic tool with broad diagnostic sensitivity across Dengue virus strains and serotypes (Gijavanekar et al., 2011) . Diagnostic sensitivity, also called true-positive rates, is defined as the percentage of samples with confirmed infection (by the 'gold standard' method) which will have positive results. Other parameters commonly used to measure reliability of a diagnostic assay are specificity, accuracy and precision. Specificity (also called the true negative rate) is the percentage of infection-free samples which will have a negative result. This qualitative assessment shows the capability of the test to distinguish target virus from the non-target viruses. Accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct results which describes how close the obtained results are to those obtained with the reference method. Precision refers to the reproducibility of the assay on the same sample in obtaining similar results (Souf, 2016) .",16.082935445271442,9.5363101636041

Available 3D structures of homologs, orthologs, or paralogs  are a rich source of information regarding domain boundaries and unstructured loop regions, which need to be  considered when designing crystallizable targets (see 3.17 The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics  Protein Data Bank) . Because multidomain proteins can exhibit a high degree of conformational flexibility, which might preclude crystallization, trimming down the target to a more compact form consisting of the catalytic core represents a logical strategy, particularly for the purposes of SBDD. Some recent examples pertaining to this approach include studies on the kinase domain of c-Abl, 15 and our own work on the bifunctional catalytic domain of the bacterial stringent response factor, RelA/SpoT. 16 Proteolytic mapping of the full-length protein with subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE can be a useful technique for identifying stable domains. Typically, the full-length protein is digested with a panel of proteases, and samples are analyzed either at fixed time points with different protease concentrations, or at variable time points with fixed protease concentrations. The protein can also be digested in the presence of known ligands or inhibitors, since ligand-induced ordering of unstructured regions may lead to unique digestion maps and suggest alternative possibilities for DNA construct design. Characterization of stable fragments by N-terminal sequencing or mass spectrometry is subsequently carried out to provide a framework for gene construct optimization. 17 Recent years have seen an explosion of useful bioinformatics tools, which can aid in gene construct design by predicting disordered regions in a given protein sequence (see 3.15 Bioinformatics; 3.16 Gene and Protein Sequence Databases). These include FoldIndex, 18 DisEMBL, 19 DISOPRED2, 20 DRIP-PRED (R. M. MacCallum, unpublished data), GlobPlot 2, 21 IUPred, 22 PONDR, 23 Prelink, 24 RONN, 25 and the VL2/VL3/VL3H/VL3E suite, 26, 27 all of which utilize different methods (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines) for disorder prediction. The bi-annual CASP (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction) challenge, which constantly evaluates and ranks the accuracy of the various structure prediction programs, has noted very significant progress in the field. 28 A curated database containing information on proteins with partial or complete disorder, DisProt, is under development. 29 Perhaps one of the most exciting recent developments that promises to greatly assist the process of gene construct design is deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) (Figure 3) . 30, 31 This method, which produces highresolution maps of ordered and disordered regions along the protein sequence, requires only micrograms of soluble protein, can detect disordered segments as little as four residues, can be used in combination with ligands and inhibitors, and has demonstrated success in producing crystallizable fragments. 31 Figure 3 A schematic depiction of the hydrogen/deuterium-exchange MS (DXMS) procedure to aid the design of DNA constructs by identifying unstructured regions in the protein target. After establishment of initial protein fragmentation maps, the protein of interest is incubated in deuterium oxide (D 2 O) for 10s at 0 1C, leading to rapid exchange at solvent exposed amide nitrogens. After rapid denaturation in an acidic quench solution, deuterated samples are proteolyzed by brief exposure to immobilized pepsin. Proteolytic fragments are separated by HPLC, analyzed by MS, and disordered regions are localized by interpretation of amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange maps. 30, 31 Protein Crystallography in Drug Discovery 3.38.3.1.2 Affinity chromatography: finding the right tag To aid in purification, recombinant protein targets are usually fused to an affinity tag, which can be added to the N-or C-terminus of the target sequence, or, if necessary, inserted within the sequence. To maximize the crystallization potential of the recombinant target, emphasis should be placed on diversification when selecting affinity tags. A vast number of affinity tags are available, and an ideal choice will depend on numerous factors including preferred tag location, tag size (ranging from a few residues to 4100 kDa), and the desired balance of auxiliary tag characteristics such as gene expression and solubility of the tagged protein, ease of purification, overall purity of the eluted sample, or secreted expression. 12 Oligohistidine tags (His-tags) are often a first choice because of their relatively low cost, small size, and ease of use. 32 The incorporation of a His-tag permits simple one-step purification using an immobilized metalaffinity chromatography (IMAC) resin such as Ni 2 þ -nitrilotriacetate, but a second 'polishing step' using size-exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography is often needed to eliminate contaminating host proteins that have a natural affinity for IMAC resins. If subsequent tag removal is desired (e.g., if it is suspected that the tag might be interfering with crystallization or protein activity), vectors such as Qiagen's pQE-30 Xa are available that allow incorporation of a cleavable tag containing a flanking protease recognition site. A recent comparative study of different affinity tags has touted the use of the StrepII tag (Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys), which binds a modified streptavidin-coupled matrix (Strep-Tactin). 33 According to this study, the StrepII tag affords much higher purity over the His tag at a comparable cost. Large affinity tags containing fusion proteins, such as the maltose-binding protein, 34 thioredoxin, 35 or glutathione-S-transferase 36 can improve folding and enhance solubility of the coupled target. Moreover, the growing number of chimeric target-fusion crystal structures that are being reported suggests that fusion proteins can be useful tools for crystallization. 37 ",16.98450691752674,8.850766833012944

Also, quantifying the sensitivity and specificity of capture with comprehensive probe sets is challenging --as it is for metagenomic sequencing more broadly --due to the need to obtain viral genomes for the hundreds of targeted species and the risk of false positives from components of sequencing and classification that are unrelated to capture (e.g., contamination in sample processing or read misclassifications).

Consequently, DNA chips have rapidly been applied to fields such as gene identification, genetic expression analysis, DNA sequencing and clinical diagnostics [2] . The detection and analysis of point mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) is one of the main applications of DNA micro-arrays [3] . The majority of DNA micro-array technologies, including the Gene Chip of Affymetrix Inc., are based on passive hybridization, i.e. the binding event depends upon diffusion of target DNA molecules to the capture probes [4] . A passive DNA hybridization approach may take several hours, since target DNAs with a typical diffusion coefficient of 9.943 × 10 −7 cm 2 /s (for 18 base pair oligonucleotides) [5] reach the capture probes only via Brownian random motion in order to hybridize. Because of this dependency on diffusion transport of target DNA, large amounts of target DNA and long hybridization times are often required to achieve sufficient hybridization signals and repeatability of signals. Accordingly, a large number of researchers are seeking alternative methods to make DNA sensing faster and more sensitive in low concentration target DNA solutions [6] . One of the earlier alternative methods was to utilize electric fields to accelerate the rate of interaction between capture probes and target DNA molecules. Nanogen, for example, has overcome the slow diffusion obstacle by transporting negatively charged target DNA via electrophoresis [7] . In diffusion based transport of DNA, the time (τ) it takes a DNA molecule to travel over a distance x is given by [1] : In Eq. (1), D is the diffusion coefficient and τ is the time required for a molecule to diffuse over distance x. In the case of electrophoresis the transport time, τ, is given by [8] : (2) where µ is the electrophoretic mobility, E the electric field strength and τ is the time it takes to electrophorese over distance x. Using typical values for D (9.943 × 10 −7 cm 2 /s, see above) and µ (15,000 m 2 (V s)) [6] , and under an electric field of 0.004 V/m it appears that electrophoretic transport may be 150 times faster over a 500 m distance. Even though the electrophoretic transport method presents a clear hybridization speed advantage, one critical disadvantage is that the sample solution containing the target DNA must be desalted before hybridization in order to establish an appropriate electric field. In a high salt solution, including most biological buffers, the electric field depth exists only in close proximity to the electrodes because the high concentration of ions nullifies the electric field in the area away from the electrodes. To facilitate rapid movement of DNA by an electric field, a low conductive buffer solution has to be used. In contrast, in molecular biology, to achieve efficient hybridization, one always works in high conductivity solutions. Therefore, desalting is not only counter intuitive, but also cumbersome. Another approach to enhance hybridization efficiency by Fan et al. consisted of using pumping of probe molecules dynamically past target molecules immobilized on magnetically suspended beads [9] . Others have accelerated the hybridization rate through convective mixing of hybridization fluid by using air bladders [10] , or by cavitation-induced streaming between the DNA array slide and its cover slip [11] . Also, Pappaert et al. have developed a shear-driven micro-channel system to improve rapid DNA micro-array analysis [12] while Erickson et al. have enhanced the hybridization rate electrokinetically in the micro-channel [13] . Finally, Wang et al. combined a DNA micro-array with a microfluidic platform to enhance the mass transport of target DNA so as to make detection faster and to obtain a lower detection limit (LDL) for DNA hybridization. There are several advantages associated with microfluidic DNA arrays: they enable detection at the lowest possible DNA concentrations, allow for shorter times to achieve such sensitive detection because of enhanced mass transport, offer the ability to monitor several samples in parallel by using a multi-channel approach, reduce the potential for contamination by relying on an enclosed apparatus [4] , and they hold the overall promise for integration of several functions in one apparatus (-TAS). In this paper, we investigate several factors that are important to DNA hybridization kinetics in PDMS microfluidic flow channels and demonstrate how to enhance the amount of hybridization in a fixed and short amount of time, typically 2 min. We also describe the effect of various volumetric flow rates of Cy3-labeled target DNA on hybridization with a fixed volume of the target DNA, the influence of the concentration of target DNA with fixed channel height and fixed volumetric flow rate, the con-tribution of the channel height in a fixed volumetric flow rate regime, and lastly the influence of the volumetric flow rate in a fixed amount of time.",15.173463046763414,7.60366689868264

Secondary structure of the target RNA, as well as the thermodynamic stability of both the siRNA duplex and guide-target duplex, can greatly affect the efficacy of RNAi. Generally, the RNAi target should be as unstructured as possible, particularly at the termini of the~22-nt target region, in order to improve target accessibility to RISC (48, 49) . Additional thermodynamic properties associated with active siRNAs include low GC content, asymmetric instability of the siRNA duplex (meaning an effective duplex has lower internal stability at the 5′ end compared to the 3′ end of the antisense strand (50)), and asymmetric interactions between the guide strand and the target RNA within RISC (such that the 5′ end of the guide stand is responsible for surpassing a thermodynamic threshold for stability with the target RNA for effective degradation (48) ). An optimal target will also have minimal off-target effects, just as an ideal small molecule pharmaceutical will have minimal interactions with targets beyond those therapeutically (208) desired (39) . Checking for sequence homology between the target and the host genome can minimize these effects. Furthermore, by leveraging the degree to which a specific position and the nature of mismatch between the guide strand and target RNA can affect siRNA activity and specificity, one can potentially distinguish the target from off-target regions that exhibit high degrees of sequence similarity (51) . Computational efforts can also aid in improving target prediction. There are a number of general-use websites for siRNA design developed by industry and academia that consider thermodynamic requirements of the siRNA and potential off-target effects, though these resources are not designed to address the need to target highly conserved regions in viruses to mitigate viral escape. Two design services have been developed to fill the niche for antiviral RNAi therapy design. siVirus is a web-based application that streamlines antiviral RNAi design by implementing several algorithms for creating functional siRNAs, targeting highly conserved regions of the virus, and considering potential off-target effects (52) . Currently, the software has sequence data to identify highly conserved regions of HIV, SARS, HCV, and influenza, and as second and even third generation sequencing technologies lower the cost of largescale sequencing (53) , the known genetic diversity of many viruses and the capabilities of siVirus will presumably grow.",27.588368314944766,11.372608840917618

The influence of sequence and size of single-stranded nucleic acids on helicase activity and oligomeric state. Next to the nature of the sugar, the sequence of the single-stranded region used to initially bind the protein may provide specificity for certain substrates. Therefore, again Seybert et al. (2000a) investigated the unwinding of DNA duplexes containing 10-nt long homopolymeric tails at one of their 5 ends. Although HCoV-229E nsp13 could utilize substrates with a dA, dC, or dT tail, it showed a marked preference for the two pyrimidines. In contrast, dG-containing duplexes were not unwound. However, this may not be due to a specific discrimination against guanine but rather to the formation of higher order structures in this particular substrate, which, as the authors speculated, may interfere with helicase activity. Later, it was also demonstrated that SARS-CoV nsp13 is able to initiate unwinding on tails with random sequences (Adedeji et al., 2012a) . Despite this apparent lack of sequence specificity in these in vitro assays, the function of the nidovirus helicase in infected cells may require loading at specific nucleic acid sequences or higher-order structures. Thus, it would be interesting to investigate binding affinities toward, for example, sequences located within the untranslated region of the genome, the antigenome, or any of the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) that direct the production of nidoviral sg RNAs (see Section 3.3.2). Furthermore, it is conceivable that one (or more) of the other non-structural proteins may interact and target the helicase to specific genome regions if it indeed would not possess any specificity itself.",16.34474440370832,8.205296848060605

This is the first example of effectively using sequencing technologies in the field to monitor a large epidemic caused by an emerging virus in real time as it unfolded. A critical question concerned the origins of this epidemic, as all known previous outbreaks of Zaire ebolaviruses occurred thousands of miles away in Central Africa. Genome assemblies from samples collected early in the outbreak from 78 patients in Sierra Leone suggested initially that the Makona variant diverged from central African strains in 2004 (Gire et al., 2014) . Analysis of these early samples suggested that the substitution rate of the Makona variant was higher than those observed during any previous EBOV outbreak. Subsequent sequencing studies from other clinical populations throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Mali demonstrated that the nucleotide substitution rate associated was roughly equivalent to central African Zaire ebolaviruses, suggesting that this was more likely the result of different analytical approaches (Hoenen et al., 2015; Kugelman et al., 2015; Ladner et al., 2015; Quick et al., 2016; Scarpino et al., 2015; Stadler et al., 2014; Tong et al., 2015) .

However, in the last year, systems were developed using targeted probe-based selection methods to enrich viral sequences from complex specimens. The virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) can enrich viral reads by up to 10,000fold and results in near-total genome coverage for all known viruses. Furthermore, based on highly conserved sequences, this platform could also identify highly divergent, completely uncharacterized viruses, suggesting its utility for virus discovery (Briese et al., 2015) . An alternative targeted enrichment panel, ViroCap, enriches virus reads up to 700-fold and provides up to 80% genome coverage (Wylie et al., 2015) . These enrichment methods offer great promise for rapid diagnosis of a virus infection from clinical specimens, metagenomic virome characterization, and monitoring virus evolution in real time. Unfortunately, although decreasing, the cost of next-generation sequencing instruments remains high, and this technology is not widely available in most clinical diagnostic laboratories. Short-read sequencers are large, cumbersome instruments, and the computational infrastructure necessary for robust sequence analysis is not conducive to work requiring mobility and real-time data collection, such as outbreak response or field surveillance.",15.148936574635748,9.5414692270182

The Ad mutational repertoire includes homologous recombination, illegitimate recombination, and single base mutation (SBM). Homologous recombination occurs in conserved regions of the genome between closely related viruses within the same subgroup, and it requires regions of homology in the two parent strands. It is the primary mechanism responsible for intermediate Ads, which are mosaic viruses with shared hexon characteristics, or with the hexon characteristics of one type and fiber of another. Illegitimate recombination requires only short regions of homology of one to three nucleotides (short direct repeats), and is thought to be the result of polymerase stuttering or slippage. It causes deletions, insertions and duplications of short regions of DNA. In Ads it occurs in noncoding regions and hypervariable regions (HVRs) of hexon capsid proteins that tolerate structural variation. The HVRs of the hexon contain the viral neutralization epitopes, so that mutations in these regions result in deletion, formation or alteration of these epitopes, leading to antigenic shift. It is the primary mechanism by which new serotypes arise, particularly among the fastest growing group, the subgroup D Ads. Single base mutations accumulate gradually across the viral genome but can occur at a 30-fold higher rate in the HVRs, where they cause incremental antigenic drift and the creation of variant strains. Ad evolution is compounded by all three mechanisms and perhaps others that have yet to be defined. As a result, serological identification of subgroup B2 and D Ads has become extremely difficult. It seems reasonable that the time has come to consider a sequence-based Ad classification system, similar to that in use for papillomaviruses and enteroviruses.",21.16007492858305,8.848925434265007

Ribosomal frameshifting in astroviruses","From work with retroviruses and the yeast L-A virus, it is clear that frameshifting is a potential antiviral target. Indeed, it is possible that the replication cycle of any virus that uses this process could be disrupted by modulation of frameshift efficiencies, but a better understanding of the occurrence and the molecular basis of frameshifting will be required before it can be considered a genuine target. To date, there are no confirmed examples of frameshift signals from conventional eukaryotic cellular genes, although computer-assisted database searches have identified a number of candidates (Hammell et al., 1999; Liphardt, 1999) . It is essential that these candidates be tested rigorously; although compounds like RG501 were developed as specific anti-frameshifting agents, the occurrence of cellular frameshifting signals would potentially preclude the use of such agents. For all positive-stranded RNA viruses, the exact role of frameshifting is unknown. Presumably, the frameshift allows the required ratio of viral proteins to be produced, but it may also serve to downregulate levels of viral replicases, which may be toxic in high amounts. Regarding astrovirus frameshifting, there is still much to learn. The key issue will be to determine the sequence requirements for frameshifting within the context of the complete virus genome, especially regarding the stimulatory RNA and whether it can form a pseudoknot. Infectious cDNA clones will be invaluable in this analysis and will also allow the study of the effect on virus replication of varying the frameshift efficiency. From our own perspective, with an interest in the frameshift mechanism, we are currently sequencing astrovirus clinical isolates to establish the level of natural sequence variation that is tolerated within the astrovirus frameshift region. It may be that we can identify conserved bases that may play a role in frameshifting, either through their primary sequence (binding factor recognition) or in long range, tertiary interactions with distal regions of the genome. Finally, it is important that stem-loop containing frameshift signals receive the same degree of experimental attention as pseudoknot-containing signals. It is very likely that such studies will reveal important clues to the mechanism of the frameshift process.",19.00831233017123,8.421818129155701

A limitation of microarrays is that, except for so-called universal arrays, probe designs must be updated periodically to include the ever-increasing number of microbial genome sequences being added to GenBank. Nevertheless, for many applications, microarrays offer an ideal balance of capabilities for broad-spectrum microbial surveillance.",15.527198089479699,8.933505372863761

In addition to confirming target engagement, the results revealed off-target effects and unexpected modes of action. Further, select examples performed the serial passage experiments in multiple bacterial strains and measured binding affinity to the mutants in vitro, which provided added confidence in target engagement (15,31,77). In select cases where serial passage experiments did not yield mutated isolates, the ligands were tested against mutants with established variations in structure or activity (76,65). Another powerful strategy for assessing target engagement in riboswitches was phenotype rescue by addition of the native ligand (15,46). Lastly, several of the targeted RNA elements regulated the expression or translation of specific genes, which was assessed by measuring the quantity of the RNA or protein, respectively. One study went beyond measuring the expected transcripts and performed a transcriptomic microarray analysis of genes involved in many different cellular processes (46). The observed repression was consistent with riboswitch inhibition, although addition of the native ligand failed to rescue the expression of several genes, indicating a potential cellular stress response.

Wider analysis of data will ultimately result in higher-quality assemblies. It is worth considering broader implementation of a wiki-like, crowd-sourcing strategy to genome assembly, similar to the annotation strategies that have been adopted for specific genomes of high interest (23, 24).

The method assumes that functional ORFs are longer than expected by random chance as they experience selective pressure against mutations that introduce stop codons. We quantify this by using three ways to estimate the null distribution for ORFs lengths within each reading frame of a gene, and use the null to identify those ORFs significantly longer than predicted by random chance. This approach has a number of advantages over current bioinformatics methods to detect overlapping genes. In addition to being simple and quick, it only requires a single genome sequence. This is in contrast to other bioinformatic methods that require multiple sequences to estimate and compare nucleotide or codon diversity. This feature allows the method to be applied much more broadly in both metagenomics projects where genomes of new viruses are frequently only present in a single copy (Bekal et al. 2011; Ballinger et al. 2014; Shi et al. 2016), and also in screening scenarios such as demonstrated herein. The method is best suited to refine regions of the genome that contain candidates for functional overlapping genes, after which these regions can be further tested for functionality with more resource intensive laboratory methods such as protein isolation, ribosomal profiling (Michel et al. 2012; Ingolia 2016), and studying the effects of introduced knock out mutations (Chung et al. 2008).",17.592859644771814,10.10001823969525

Competitive alignment to the now three master variants revealed that out of the ~30 million DWV blast positive reads, ~27 million were assembled to one of three genomes (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S1). Around 3 million assembled to type A, ~3.5 thousand to type B and ~24 million to Type C. As expected, more reads align to the 3′ region of the genome than the 5′ an artefact of the reverse transcription 3′ bias (Brooks et al., 1995). Although reads aligned to the whole of the Type C genome, the depth of coverage was lower at the 5′ region (Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, coverage of the 5′ region of the type A variant was unusually high, indicating that this disproportionate coverage in the 5′ regions of type A and C could be the evidence of recombination between the two variants. Because of the low read depth and coverage for type B in our samples, a full genome could not be assembled (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S1). Nonetheless, closer examination of 3′ region where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene is located (Baker and Schroeder, 2008) revealed that the Devon type B variant shared 100% identity to VDV-1 type B genome in this region (Supplementary Figure S2).

This allows easy identification of a virus at the genotype level by sequencing discrete segments of the viral genome amplified by RT-PCR. Ideally, sequencing should be done on amplicons that are known to have multiple nucleotide differences between strains. However, designing PCR primers that will capture a significant number of members of that group requires significant sequence homology, and therefore, a relatively variable region flanked by conserved regions is needed for sequence based identification. While for some virus groups such as HAV it is relatively easy to find PCR primers that can capture many members, it is much more difficult with CV genomes due to extreme sequence diversity. The length of the amplified region is another constraint for sequence based identification. Sequencing an amplicon larger that 500 bp generally will require designing multiple primers for sequence walking. Although automated sequencing techniques currently available can be used for rapid sequencing of a moderate sized amplicon, the process is still too time consuming to be used on a routine basis where a quick identification is needed.",22.02269628015323,11.22827133167294

These datasets allowed us to investigate the performance of the various methods as a function of sequencing coverage (from 50× to 10 000×). Overall, the heuristic approaches performed poorly in terms of sensitivity (Goto et al.) or PPV (Wright et al.), while all the model-based approaches (SNVer, Breseq and LoFreq) had perfect PPV and therefore perfect specificity (Table 1).

Despite the known heterogeneity of tumors, calling of somatic variants is often limited to those in a majority of the cells or performed using ad hoc approaches (10,32,41). In addition, since tumor samples are often contaminated with normal tissue, the ability to robustly detect somatic mutations can be critical. In particular, results from a samtools analysis of 14 exome sequencing datasets for gastric tumor/normal paired samples from Zang et al. (32) revealed an asymmetric frequency distribution for the somatic SNVs called, suggesting that sample contamination can lead to significantly reduced sensitivity even with high sequencing coverage (Supplementary Figure S4). Re-analysis of these datasets with LoFreq helped to recover the full distribution (Figure 2), revealing the value of a systematic approach to call low-frequency somatic SNVs even when the goal is to only identify heterozygous and homozygous variants in high-coverage datasets.

For example, when viewed on the structure of the NS5 methyltransferase (Figure 4a), a first group of cold-spots consists of contiguous residues completely enclosing the binding site of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) molecule that serves as a methyl donor for the reaction catalyzed by NS5 for capping of viral mRNAs, while a second group of cold-spots corresponds to the carboxyl end which acts as the linker region that connects to the NS5 polymerase domain. Similarly, a representation of cold-spots on the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (Figure 4b) encompasses the critical GDD catalytic triad and also most of the template tunnel through which the viral RNA substrate enters or exits during replication. Another example showing cold-spots and hotspots on the NS3 serine protease and helicase, delineating potential interaction surfaces and key resides can be found in Supplementary Figure S6. Our results here suggest that sequencing and characterizing the intra-host variation in a relatively small set of samples can be sufficient for such analysis and reveal candidate drug targets (cold-spots) as well as fast-evolving regions in the viral genome (hotspots) that can be used to estimate haplotype diversity, avoiding the computational complexity of the problem (54). The availability of a sensitive variant caller such as LoFreq thus opens up the potential for the use of this ‘quasi species footprinting’ approach (akin to phylogenetic footprinting) to reveal functionally important regions in other viral genomes as well.

Within-region phylogenetic reconstructions show that Pan_SL-CoV sequences become as divergent as BtKY72 and BM48-31 in region 3 ( fig. 1D ), while less divergent in region 4, where Pan_SL-CoV_GD clusters with ZXC21 and ZC45 (fig .  1E ). Together, these observations suggest ancestral cross-species recombination between pangolin and bat CoVs in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at the ORF1a and S genes. Furthermore the discordant phylogenetic clustering at various regions of the genome among clade 2 CoVs also supports extensive recombination among these viruses isolated from bats and pangolins.",16.883941785048933,10.214452611846747

Next-24 generation sequencing (NGS) approach has surpassed Sanger for generating long viral sequences, yet how 25 variants affect NGS de novo assembly remains largely unexplored. Our results from >15,000 simulated 26 experiments showed that presence of variants can turn an assembly of one genome into tens to thousands of 27 contigs. This ""variant interference"" (VI) is highly consistent and reproducible by ten most used de novo 28 assemblers, and occurs independent of genome length, read length, and GC content. The main driver of VI is 29 pairwise identities between viral variants. These findings were further supported by in silico simulations, 30 where selective removal of minor variant reads from clinical datasets allow the ""rescue"" of full viral genomes 31 from fragmented contigs. These results call for careful interpretation of contigs and contig numbers from de 32 novo assembly in viral deep sequencing. Genomic surveillance of viruses is particularly important in light of their rapid rate of evolution. Viruses 44 have higher mutation rates than cellular-based taxa, with RNA viruses having mutation rates as high as 1.5 × 45 10 −3 mutations per nucleotide, per genomic replication cycle. 4 Due to this high mutation rate, it is well 46 established that most RNA viruses exist as a swarm of quasispecies, 5 with each quasispecies containing unique 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The presence of these variants plays a key role in viral adaptation. 48 49 Due to viruses' rapid evolution, a single clinical sample often contains a mixture of many closely related 50 viruses. Viral quasispecies are mainly derived from intra-host evolution, with RNA viruses such as poliovirus, 51 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C (HCV), influenza, dengue, and West Nile viruses maintaining 52 diverse quasispecies populations within a host. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Conversely, the term ""viral strains"" often refers 53 to different lineages of viruses found in separate hosts, or a co-infection of viruses in the same host due to 54 multiple infection events. As a result, sequence divergence is usually higher when comparing viral strains 55 compared to quasispecies. In this study, we use the term ""variant"" to encompass both quasispecies and 56 strains regardless of how the variants originated in the biological samples. 57 58 Since many sequencing technologies produce reads that are significantly shorter than the target 59 genome size, a process to construct contigs, scaffolds, and full-length genomes is needed. Reference-mapping 60 and de novo assembly are the two primary bioinformatic strategies for genome assembly. Reference-mapping 61 requires a closely-related genome as input to align reads, while de novo assembly generates contigs without 62",16.3119546091515,9.396301451383566

To test for modularity, we further developed sensors and primer sets for the detection of potato virus Y (PVY), and confirmed function with the same assay ( Figure 1C) . The specificity of our system was also tested by interrogating the crosstalk between the product of various RPA reactions and noncognate molecular sensors. Specifically, we tested color production from cell-free reactions containing the reporter DNA construct for CMV with the PVY IVT-derived RPA product, as well as the converse, and found color production only between cognate pairs of input RPA and reporter constructs ( Figure 1D) . We next interrogated the inherent limit of detection of our system through titration of input IVT products ( Figure 1E ). This demonstrated our ability to detect the presence of target nucleic acid sequences down to the picomolar range.

However, when determining population diversity structure, many studies still use cloning for isolate sequencing, and examining chromatograms to describe nucleotide polymorphism (74) (75) (76) . Increasingly, studies have exclusively used deep-sequencing for population SNP detection (77, 78) . In this study, both clonal sequencing and population deep sequencing had merits and shortcomings. Clonal mapping of mutational neighborhoods with 50 clones involved relatively small sample sizes but allowed unambiguous identification of single, double, and triple mutant combinations. Illumina sequencing of populations provided a more reassuringly complete picture of the mutational neighborhood -highly consistent with that of the clonal sequencing -but it might recover hitchhiking mutations that might not be responsible for the phenotype of interest, and cannot assign combinations of mutations to a single genome. For instance, more sophisticated approaches would be required to determine that the phi6 strains with Small segment mutations did not also have one or more of the prevalent p3 mutations, since these unconnected chromosomes could not become linked with longer sequencing reads. An additional durable problem is in haplotype determination. Population genetic analyses require a firm assessment of haplotypes in the population, and although many software programs are available for haplotype prediction, these programs were validated on shorter genomic regions and performed poorly on the tripartite 13kb phi6 genome, and accuracy depends heavily on read length, which we were unable to provide with 150bp Illumina single-end reads (79) .",15.711142503650361,7.313125856917084

Interestingly, although we obtained a higher number of sequencing reads for P. falciparum, the mapping of the reads was suboptimal compared to that of T. gondii. Repetitive DNA sequence motifs are characteristic of many large eukaryotic genomes and this has been known to complicate the mapping of reads that cannot be confidently assigned to these particular regions [63] . In theory, long read sequencing mitigates this problem because long enough reads should unambiguously match a unique site on the genome, irrespective of low complexity or repeat sequences. However, the genome of P. falciparum is particularly AT-rich (~82%) with numerous regions of extreme low complexity [64] . Thus, we may expect some reads, particularly the shorter ones, to fail the mapping parameters. Indeed, as indicated above, reads that fail to map to the genome tended to be shorter than reads that do. This is further exacerbated by the high error rate produced from ONT sequencing. Based on previous experiments, the per base error rate of direct RNA sequencing using ONT is 10-20% [51, 61] . In our dataset, we estimated the error rate to be around 20%. This may have further contributed to the poorer mapping, though we do not expect the high error rate to significantly impact our study because the main analysis is focused on splice connectivity, rather than base sequences. As has happened for ONT DNA sequencing, we are likely to see significant improvements in read and mapping accuracy of RNA sequences as improvements are made to the flow cell and base caller. A study carried out by Runtuwe and colleagues is an elegant example, where ONT DNA sequencing on targeted P. falciparum genes yielded a mapping percentage that improved from 57.86% to 92.46% with improved chemistry of the flow cell, and upgrades to the base-calling algorithms [65] .",15.394056788762342,6.884676879731789

Once the long viral RNA is fragmented, the number of available target sequences increases dramatically. Since our detection signal is proportional to the number of looped nanoswitches, a nanoswitch mixture for different target sequences within the viral genome is expected to provide an increased signal. To test this, we developed an algorithm for choosing multiple sequence regions in the viral genome that can be targeted by the nanoswitches (Note S1). First, we chose the default target length as 30 nucleotides based on results from screening nanoswitches with different detection arm lengths (Fig.  S3) . Then, the algorithm selectively excluded target sequences that could form stable secondary structures (Fig. S4 ) and cross-binding with nanoswitch backbone oligos (Fig. S5) , and enforced GC content and uniqueness of sequences.

If a virus has R < 0.3, FastViromeExplorer discards the virus. This criterion is motivated by the observation that some annotated viruses only have reads mapped to the repeat regions of their genomes. For example, while analyzing the fecal samples from Lee et al. [14] , we found that for the BeAn 58058 virus (NC 032111.1), all the reads were mapped to one particular region of its genome, from 8,200 bp to 8,700 bp (see supplementary figure 1 ). Analyzing this region using RepeatMasker [27] revealed that it is a simple repeat region and falls into the class of Alu elements. If the virus is truly present in the sample, we expect reads to be mapped to not only the repeat region but also other regions of the genome. Therefore, finding this virus is likely an artifact caused by the prevalence of repeat regions instead of real biological signals. By imposing this criterion, we filter out any virus for which all the reads are mapped to a repeat region of the virus genome. If a virus is truly present in the sample, the mapped reads to the virus should come from random locations of the genome, assuming that the mapped reads follow a Poisson distribution along the genome, the expected coverage of the virus genome C e can be computed by Equation (3). If the reads are all mapped to a repeat region, the observed coverage of the virus genome C o is expected to be much lower than C e , as a result, R is low and by imposing a cutoff of 0.3 (determined based on our empirical analyses), viruses that have reads mapped to only repeat regions get filtered out.",18.721859089159736,9.356807175346532

Also, quantifying the sensitivity and specificity of capture with comprehensive probe sets is challenging -as it is for metagenomic sequencing more broadly -because doing so would necessitate obtaining viral genomes for the hundreds of targeted species, and false positives are likely to be due to components of sequencing and classification that are unrelated to capture (e.g., contamination in sample processing or read misclassifications). For sequencing some ultra low input samples, targeted amplicon approaches may be faster and more sensitive 38 , but genome size, sequence heterogeneity, and the need for prior knowledge of the target species can limit the feasibility and sensitivity of these approaches 1, 56, 57 . Similarly, for molecular diagnostics of particular pathogens, many commonly used assays such as qRT-PCR and rapid antigen tests are likely to be faster and less expensive than metagenomic sequencing.

The size increase of the ORF1b-like region was an extraordinary 9-fold higher than would be expected from the extremely low variation in the size of this region among other nidoviruses normalized to genome size variation. This observation implies that PSCNV broke the tightly constrained ORF1b size barrier (23), but expanded modestly in the ORF1a-like and 3'ORFs-like regions. This pattern fits the wavelike dynamic model of genome expansion in nidoviruses (23) . Accordingly, extant nidovirus genomes of different sizes reached particular points on a common trajectory of genome expansion dominated by consecutive increases of ORF1b, ORF1a, and 3'ORFs. A complete cycle of genome expansion was reported to encompass the 12.7-31.7 kb range, with the expansion of ORF1b expected to lead a second cycle beyond that size range. The sizes of PSCNV's three main regions support this model, and show that nidoviruses were able to start a second cycle of genome expansion, whose feasibility has remained uncertain so far.

For the amplicon-based system, a series of primers were designed such that the SARS-CoV-2 genome could be amplified in appropriately 1000 base paired sequential fragments, with an approximately 200 base pair overlap to allow sequence assembly from the amplicon data (Fig. 1A) . The primers were selected on the basis of conserved regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome based upon an initial deposition of 17 genomes. The rationale to generate short amplicons was also to allow the selection of primer pairs that could amplify longer segments should one set of primers fail on a particular sample. To test whether the primers could generate amplicons, RNA was purified from Vero cells that had been infected with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (MT007544.1 GenBank). This RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis followed by PCR using the conserved primers. This generated 30 amplicons covering the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and these were sequenced using MinION (Fig. 1B) . The amplicon-based approach was then evaluated on nasopharyngeal swabs collected from two patients with COVID-19.",13.823601841798997,6.100740035578659

The methods described here provide a rapid workflow for evaluating and prioritizing safe and immunogenic regions of a viral genome for use in vaccination. With the third epidemic in the past two decades underway, and all originating from a coronavirus family virus, these viruses will continue to threaten the human population, and necessitate the need for prophylactic measures against future outbreaks. A subset of the epitopes selected here are derived from viral regions sharing a high degree of homology with other viruses in the family, and thus we expect these evolutionarily conserved regions to be essential in the infectivity and replicative lifecycle across the coronavirus family, suggesting that an immune response against the epitopes listed herein may provide more broadly protective immunity against other coronaviruses.",13.59299242445478,9.737161713660033
