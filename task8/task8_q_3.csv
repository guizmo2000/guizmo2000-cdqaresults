For the purposes of this debate, we propose an expanded definition of syndromic surveillance to include the use of data on pre-diagnostic clinical syndromes rather than confirmed cases of specific diseases. The use of pre-diagnostic data and statistical algorithms aims to detect epidemics earlier than traditional surveillance based on reporting from laboratories and healthcare facilities, including atypical presentations of severe disease [1] .

The university-based model of postgraduate training in public health draws upon the model disseminated by the Rockefeller Foundation of dedicated, prestigious training institutes, distinct from clinical training institutes [26] . There is a dearth of public health training programs in universities in LMIC. Australia, for example, has 18 Public Health Education and Research Program (PHERP) funded public health training programs through universities and institutions [27]; South Asia -with a population eighty times that of the Australia -has only 12 schools of public health [28] . In the African continent, covering a population fifty times that of Australia, there are only 50 schools of public health [28] . This model of education has been critiqued for providing classroombased training of dubious relevance to 'real world' problems in LMIC [24, 28] . The most devastating argument against this model of training, however, is the fact that there are too few institutions to produce sufficient public health personnel in LMIC. The continued dominance of this model as the most prestigious form of public health training in LMIC represents a diversion of resources from more effective forms of public health training. The streamed training model has been used by UNICEF, WHO and other international aid agencies [24, 29] . This model aims to train workers in specified areas of public health practice, such as tuberculosis or diarrhoeal and vaccine-preventable diseases. This model is usually taken up by junior health workers who are provided with a limited set of public health competencies. While it is cost effective in meeting its educational goals, the streamed training model creates a cadre of public health workers who are generally positioned too low in the health bureaucracy to improve health policy or essential research. However, this model can quickly, efficiently and cost effectively meet emergent issues at the grass roots -until higher level pub-lic health specialists come on site.

The World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the value of national surveillance systems in the International Health Regulations (2005) , an agreement among all member states to develop and maintain sufficient capacity for the detection, reporting, and control of public health threats of international concern [2] . Infectious disease surveillance should enable (i) the timely detection of outbreaks, (ii) the quantification of health problems, (iii) the identification of subpopulations at risk, and (iv) the assessment of temporal trends including the impact of control strategies [3, 4] . National surveillance systems typically collect data from patients seeking care at sentinel hospitals or other healthcare facilities and can provide useful information for public health purposes. However, hospital-based surveillance generally underestimates disease burden since only a proportion of cases visit a hospital for care [5] . Low case detection may also undermine the value of hospital-based surveillance for outbreak detection. Moreover, if patients captured by the surveillance system are not representative of all cases in the community, surveillance statistics could lead to erroneous interpretations of disease patterns and misallocation of prevention resources. In particular, sex, socioeconomic status, or distance can affect healthcare seeking at hospitals, especially where access to care is limited [6] [7] [8] [9] . Surveillance evaluation guidelines, such as those established by the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, list sensitivity and representativeness among the attributes that a public health surveillance system should possess and that require assessment [10, 11] .

Routine surveillance has continuously evolved since 2010, expanding in scale and scope with more sites reporting on more conditions every year since. The ability to add diseases and conditions to the system before and during outbreaks, and if necessary set up enhanced complementary components such as cholera surveillance exemplifies the system's adaptability, scalability, and flexibility. The planned integration of community-based surveillance will improve detection of health threats in rural communities where health-care utilization is very low. 20 In line with CDC and WHO guidelines on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response, the system should be integrated to coordinate and streamline the portfolio of existing surveillance activities and to maximize efficiency and resources, rather than trying to maintain separate vertical activities. 21 The experience of establishing a surveillance system of national scope in Haiti utilizing existing surveillance infrastructure highlights the fact that it is more efficient to integrate existing disease surveillance data flows into a matrix-like structure where vertical (or in-depth) surveillance systems capture the information necessary to meet the surveillance data needs of a horizontal (or broad) system. Cholera surveillance provides a working example of a vertically designed module capable of being integrated into the horizontal routine system. Such an integrated and centralized platform of surveillance is a step in helping Haiti to conform to the 2005 IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. 22, 23 Through a resolution in 2008, WHO emphasized the role of public health laboratories by calling for the organization of a national public health laboratory that would link national, regional, subregional, and international laboratories. 24 Internationally, the national laboratory has already developed partnerships with the relevant regional laboratory (Caribbean Public Health Agency) and reference laboratories (e.g., CDC-Atlanta). Within the country, the national laboratory is working on implementing in-country regional laboratories that will greatly improve the laboratory component of the surveillance system and ensure that laboratory results are linked in surveillance system with cases. Integrating laboratory confirmation into routine surveillance and its complementary systems is essential to minimize delays in taking public health action. 20 The laboratory-enhanced surveillance system represents a significant step in the long-term transition toward laboratory-based surveillance and a model for how the laboratory testing can be best integrated into routine surveillance STRENGTHENING NATIONAL DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE activities as capacity in this field continues to grow. However, much work remains to be done along this axis. As one example of an area for future improvement, the ongoing implementation of electronic laboratory information management systems will allow testing results to be linked with case data in real time. Furthermore, laboratory diagnostic capacity at the level of health facilities across the country needs to continue to be improved in parallel to the strengthening of regional reference laboratories. To achieve this, in parallel to building diagnostic capacity at this level, sites should be encouraged to routinely send samples to the national laboratory as a part of their quality assurance program.",39.319350540747635,15.073743158617255

Thematic discussions on actions or policies related to the development of guidelines and indicators appeared with regard to infectious disease surveillance and management of rare diseases but were not a major theme across interviews. The EU-level task to promote best practice exchange among member states was regarded as influential, which is represented by a top position in one of the rankings presented in this paper. With regard to the task of establishing monitoring and evaluation structures, some respondents perceived the status of the EU health information system rather as a failure.

Respondents agreed that cooperation in the area of public health between member state representatives and experts as well as with other stakeholder groups has increased and has been facilitated by the EU through various projects, networks, forums, and platforms. This trend was mainly positively perceived since it supported EU-level public health policy by accumulating and exchanging knowledge, generating public support and a legitimacy to act on certain fields [3] . This finding is corroborated by the literature on the potential of new governance instruments for health-and social policy-making at EU-level [11, [52] [53] [54] . However, these new governance instruments can also be regarded as a rather strategic investment of the EC to keep topics on the agenda until a political window of opportunity opens but as an ineffective policy tool to enforce and implement action in due course [6] . The collaboration of a diverse set of stakeholders as it is the case for example in the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health can lead to actions that constitute rather a compromise of various interests. Consequently, the results might be disappointing from the viewpoint of public health experts [6, 55] . A final judgment on the impact of facilitating collaboration is to be awaited and may only be made in the long term future. It will require different ways of measuring 'impact' compared to the analysis of domestic adaptations when implementing EU hard law [56] .",40.3092475440512,13.767030713992165

In recent years, the EC has summarized in annual reports a diverse nature of key public health achievements such as communications and recommendations, health policies, EC co-financed actions and established networks (e.g. high level groups, scientific committees, platforms) [22] [23] [24] . However, stakeholders in the field provide examples indicating that public health relevant EU policies such as single EU policy assessments on the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) [25, 26] , pharmaceuticals [27] , or the Health in All Policy (HiAP) approach [28] do not always meet the expectations of the public health community. In these papers the authors express concerns about potentially detrimental health effects [25, 26] or disappointment about the support of the policies and approaches aimed at improving health in Europe [27, 28] . Also, EU agencies such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) are described as agencies with a limited legal mandate, competences and resources for EU public health but, at the same time, with promising prospects to develop as a renowned international player in the field [29] .",35.71804463780508,12.333034501307258

The original EU health mandate focused primarily on stimulating cooperation between member states and supporting national actions (Art. 129 (1), Treaty of the European Union (TEU)) [2] . It embodied the Union with only limited legislative powers on health matters. Although this initial mandate was enhanced through subsequent Treaties, today Article 168, still gives the EU relatively circumscribed power in areas of public health (Art. 168 (4), TFEU). Healthcare continues to remain a national competence and in this regard, the EU ""shall respect the responsibilities of the member states for the definition of their health policy and for the organization and delivery of their health services"" (Art. 168 (7), TFEU). Despite the restricted Treaty-based mandate for health, the EU has a relevant role to play in national public health and health systems policies and has expanded its remit in areas beyond the Treaty [3] . Areas affected by EU provisions are extensively described in the literature [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . To illustrate the main developments in the area of what can be called ""EU health policy"" a timeline is illustrated in Table 1 .

Media may be a tool for public health officials to communicate preventive measures to the public during disease outbreaks. Therefore, the effect of significantly increasing the volume of media coverage was explored.

A policy analysis,"With solid evidence and a comprehensive understanding of inequities, there are many ways that public health can begin to address the social determinants of health in programming. One possibility is using public health planning models that integrate the social determinants of health into the planning process. The Region of Waterloo Public Health in ON developed a planning model that does this, based on the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS) [69] . The model is called Evidence and Practice-based Planning Framework: with a focus on health inequities. In the first two steps of program planning (1. Define Issue, 2. Situational Assessment), planners are encouraged to consider the following: community health needs, the OPHS mandate on the social determinants of health, and the association between health status and the determinants of health. Further, they are asked to engage stakeholder perspectives [69] . Another model developed by the National Public Health Partnership in Australia makes the determinants of health even more central to the planning process [70] . This framework bases the intervention on the determinant that is causing the health problem, rather than the health problem itself. Public health teams are to identify the determinants of the health problem and their context, assess how determinants may be detrimental or protective, appraise different intervention options, decide on an option -taking into consideration its impact on health equity, then implement and review it [70] . When consistently implemented province-wide these types of planning models will help public health teams incorporate the equity and the social determinants of health into practice in a systematic manner.",32.30574293915505,10.851438426791889

To our understanding, global health can be considered as an application of medical and public health sciences together with other disciplines (1) in tackling those issues with global impact and (2) in the effort to seek global solutions. Thus, global health treats public health sciences and medicine as their foundations, and will selectively use theories, knowledge, techniques, therapeutics and prevention measures from public health, medicine, and other disciplines to understand and solve global health problems. There are also clear boundaries between global health, public health and medicine with regard to the target population. Medicine targets patient populations, public health targets health populations in general, while global health targets the global population. We have to admit that there are obvious overlaps between global health, public health and medicine, particularly between global health and international health. It is worth noting that global health can be considered as an extension of international health with regard to the scope and purposes. International health focuses on the health of participating countries with intention to affect non-participating countries, while global health directly states that its goal is to promote health and prevent and treat diseases for all people in all countries across the globe.

Taiwanese interviewees familiar with the DoH recalled that this was one of the main conduits for information exchange between the Taiwanese authorities and their Beijing counterparts. Interactions with the WHO bureaucracy were, however, severely restricted. DoH and CDC officials with international expertise in specific public health issue areas had, up to 2005, been able to interact on a piecemeal basis as advisors to WHO, attending various technical meetings.

The timely launch of our multi-channel risk communication program to all Taipei citizens on Friday, October 12, allowed us to provide clear instructions to families on how to prevent the infection at home over the course of weekend, when infection rates would normally increase. These direct communication methods successfully convinced parents to keep their symptomatic children at home (from 10% to 60% in Table 3 ). With contagious students confined to their homes, school transmissions decreased dramatically and public health officials were able to contain the Taipei outbreak quickly. The effectiveness of these innovative methods in the heavily populated metropolitan area of Taipei City was evidenced by how quickly the epidemic, which had infected 5414 students, subsided after 2 weeks. This can be compared with the two months that were needed to control Taipei's previous CV-24 epidemic in 1987 [28] . The importance of appropriate risk communication in response to disasters has often been overlooked by public health officials in Taiwan. Traditionally, the mass media has helped disseminate epidemic information and increase awareness on how health risks may be reduced. However, the modern mass media has, at times, had a negative impact on public health efforts by encouraging public indifference or sensationalizing incomplete and inaccurate information.

This division often results in DVOs being one step removed from livestock keepers and reliant on PAHSPs for information on any disease outbreak events. There can be significant barriers to this information flow, particularly when relationships between DVOs and PAHSPs are strained by service provision disputes (often relating to poorly applied legislative frameworks), the lack of sanitary mandates and limited recognition and support for frontline personnel by the higher public sector authorities. These problems are not unique to developing country settings.

The public health system is the lead in responding to outbreaks and in minimizing the impact of diverse emergencies on health [2, 3] . Public health sector activities in infectious disease emergencies include leading other emergency management organizations during outbreaks, conducting surveillance and investigation, implementing control measures, developing guidance for health-care practitioners, and communicating risks [3] . In addition, public health is the lead sector in preparing for the population health effects of non-infectious events incited by natural or anthropogenic hazards. Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada's response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3] . Recognizing complex and system-level challenges that affect emergency preparedness efforts globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for all countries to create resilient integrated systems that can be responsive and proactive to any future threat, although this remains a knowledge gap [4, 5] . While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states [4, 6] . Local and regional public health agencies aim to mitigate risks and protect population health; however, they face challenges to ensure readiness for potential emergencies ranging widely in likelihood and impact.

These results again confirmed our hypothesis that the Chinese online community reacted more strongly to an outbreak that happened in China than one outside China. Drawing on the social amplification of risk model [31] , public risk perception is shaped by a process of interplays between psychological, cultural, social, and institutional factors that may result in amplifying or attenuating the public attention to risk. Mass communication is among the list of factors. Public health officials have long recognised the role of the mass media in disseminating risk and emergency information before, during, and after a catastrophe [32] . The World Health Organization establishes guidelines for ""effective media communication"", through which the authorities are able to disseminate information to the public [33] . Communication during crisis was traditionally understood to be a one-way and top-down process, in which the public are assumed to be ""deficient"" in knowledge, while the scientists, public health experts, and emergency managers, are ""sufficient"" [34] . But this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media. For instance, Leung and Nicoll argued that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media ""challenged conventional public health communication"" [35] . In China, online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake [36] . Social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks [34] . Our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities, whether in Beijing or Geneva, received strong reactions in the Chinese online community. With such knowledge, social media should be incorporated in the best practices for risk and crisis communication [37] . Social media data can also provide health authorities, researchers and the media a quantifiable measure of public attention towards a particular disease outbreak [11] .",48.736973767446386,18.230616225539066

Instead, precise public health surveillance identified two at-risk areas situated at Miami-Dade County. Mosquito control measures focused on those areas. After six weeks, when the health officials were convinced by ongoing surveillance, restrictions in one area was lifted and resources were mobilized to the other area [9] . So precision public health is a concept that guides precise interventional strategies to address public health problems among precisely defined population using precise surveillance data [13] . Instead of issuing high alert for impending outbreak for entire country at a single point of time, it can be done more precisely at different place at different point of time based on geospatial modelling, simulated using precise surveillance data.

The one health approach to zoonoses however remains an average priority for health care professionals. The impact of zoonoses on animal health has been largely neglected but the effects on public health usually drive control initiatives on zoonoses and are much better defined by the use of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) [30] . The first zoonoses prioritization exercise involving health professionals in North America who had a limited knowledge of infectious diseases identified zoonoses as an area of priority [31] . Another study reported that local public health agencies in North America were not prepared and potentially unaware of their responsibility to be the initiator of the work on zoonotic disease information intelligence [32] . The advancement of the one health approach has increased the discussion and reporting on the topic. There remains a lack of knowledge and application of the integrated approach to health care by the health care professionals.

Standardized interlaboratory test validation, intersectoral collaboration and establishment of an international one health diagnostic platform are considered to be important strategies [33] . The sharing of best practices on diagnosis of zoonoses and the further refinement of new, cheaper, multispecies tests which can be interpreted by minimally trained individuals could contribute to a greater level of intersectoral integration, control, and elimination of zoonoses. The projection from one health may eventually lead to a one system approach based on the inherent challenges to intersect disciplines that belong to different systems.

Lack of public health legal expertise across Europe compounds this inaccessibility.

In order to maintain a sustained economic growth, the central government has increased its public health funding significantly since the SARS outbreak.

Unlike SARS and swine influenza, HeV is a low-incidence high-consequence pathogen [54] . This type of slow emerging zoonosis, which only affects human health occasionally, comes with its own set of unique challenges. Because they recur infrequently, remain geographically localised or have a limited effect on public health, the health risk they pose to humans may be difficult to assess. However, there is a need to recognise the potential significance of this type of zoonosis earlier and implement risk mitigation measures accordingly. Failing to do so, may put people at risk, in particular professionals such as farmers, zoo and wildlife carers, and veterinarians who may come in contact with an infected animal. However, it would be unrealistic to mobilise the same level of resources used for the management of zoonoses such as SARS or swine influenza. Nevertheless, it may be possible to develop a template framework for the management of slowly emerging zoonoses, which could include: improving veterinary IC and emerging zoonoses management preparedness through education; better communication between government authorities, veterinarians and the public; better recognition of the biosecurity and public health role and services provided by private veterinarians; consultation with private veterinarians when developing zoonoses management plans compatible with running private practices; a clearer definition of the respective roles of government, professional agencies and private veterinarians using officially ratified agreements; and better and equitable government support for the management of emerging zoonoses to all private veterinarians across all affected geographic areas.

Turnock (36) describes two major aims of public health laws: to protect and foster public health and to safeguard the rights of the individual. In emergency situations, imposing limitations on individual rights is unavoidable (34) . In the United States, in the 1905 Supreme Court case Jacobson v. Massachusetts the court sustained the right of the authorities to use penalties to pressure people to be vaccinated during a smallpox epidemic. This ruling interpreted the use of the public health authority and the way the court balanced two strong competing values: the public good and individual liberties (37) .

However, early legislation enables legal definition of individual rights, thereby facilitating optimal actions during the emergency itself (35) . According to Gerwin (34) , during pandemics, governance that assures a legal balance between the needs of the public and those of the individual enhances public trust in the authorities' ability to manage the situation. By contrast, in the wake of the 2001 terror attack in the United States, the rights of the individual were significantly curtailed by a powerful government supported by legal measures (8) .",36.156149074199,12.61609231448846

The federal government established the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) in 2004. Although created as a government department separate from Health Canada, PHAC reports directly to the federal Minister of Health and is headed up by a Chief Public Health Officer. Although cities, provincial governments, and RHAs have long had chief public health officers, this was the first national officer for the country as a whole.",37.85581746660033,12.167975337672488

These efforts are based on well-developed theories and their application after events such as exposure to industrial hazards and contaminated drinking supplies (Commission on Risk Perception and Communication 1989; Fischhoff 1995; Johnson and Slovic 1995; Rowan 1994; Sandman 1991 Sandman , 1993 . The applicability of such events to bioterrorism, however, may be limited because of bioterrorism's intentional nature and the relative unfamiliarity of both the public and medical community with the likely agents. It is important to understand how risk communication strategies can best address sociocultural differences. As was apparent in the aftermath of both the anthrax attacks and the smallpox inoculation efforts, different groups in our society have very different life experiences and beliefs through which they view official communications regarding bioterrorism and related health behaviors. The collaborative and multigroup approach that the Institute of Medicine recommends is essential to a public health approach to these issues (Institute of Medicine 2003). Better understanding these issues must be a priority, especially considering the importance of risk communication to mediating, mitigating, or promulgating emotional and behavioral responses in the event of a bioterrorist attack, and given the reality that an effective public health response will likely require communitywide action.",38.42797439286912,11.95098491555881

Surprisingly, an example from Washington D.C. suggests that at least for some types of hazards and in at least one region, welldefined roles were not clear (Schulman, 2015) . The DHHS in collaboration with the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) sought to determine how local health departments (LHDs) could best contribute to a large-scale chemical event response. A focus group of 33 local, state, federal, and nonprofit agency representatives in the National Capital Region met to discuss possible roles. The result of the focus group was that the participants had very different perspectives on the role of LHDs in a chemical response. Though LHDs have responsibility for protecting human health in all hazards, the role of LHDs was perceived to be limited to disease prevention and control and not really in responding to a hazardous material incident. As noted by Schulman (2015) , ""the perception of chemical incidents as hazardous material (hazmat) events, and not public health events, may result in LHDs being left out of the loop, even after the incident transitions to a mass casualty or mass fatality event."" She also identified the following roles for LHDs. l ""Public health surveillance activities are crucial to determining that an event has happened, as well as the nature of the event. Routine passive surveillance results can be monitored for unusual symptoms associated with chemical exposures. l LHDs' preexisting community relationships position them to be a trusted source of risk communications. While other responders handle the hazardous materials, LHDs have the ability to calm and inform the populace. l LHDs provide subject matter expertise to healthcare partners on matters such as the toxicity of chemical agents and sampling and screening approaches. If the agent is unknown, LHDs could use epidemiologic investigation methods to help identify it. l Other potential roles based on LHD expertise include: (a) coordinating the provision of mental and behavioral health services to affected communities; and (b) providing guidance to ensure the safety and health of on-theground responders.",41.09550972092067,15.425566412585676

It is estimated that less than 100 consortia are in the United States, of which about 20% to 30% are involved in global health. Several of them are well established and linked to prestigious universities with 5 to 10 institutional members. APACPH and the Global Health Education Consortium (GHEC) are the more established consortia, which have been functioning for nearly 25 and 20 years, respectively. Consortia are dynamic, even unstable at stages in their development, and are constantly challenged for resources. Leadership issues are not uncommon and are more linked to resources than policy, country, or affiliations. Economics of scale and complementarities of skills in organizations tend to form partnerships or mergers, providing resources and stability. The recently founded Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH, 2008) is one of the larger university alliances in the United States. Besides the traditional fields of medicine, nursing, and public health, CUGH has the potential of accelerating advocacy for global health and involving several other disciplines such as engineering, law, agriculture, veterinary medicine, and social sciences. Responding to the increase in DAH funding in the United States, there has been a striking increase in the overall number of universities and their top leadership promoting university-wide involvement in global health (CUGH, 2009). 34 Global health training in universities across the United States has accelerated, and this trend is a giant step in bringing contentious professions to serve synergistically together in DAH.

Another potential benefit of routine near real-time surveillance is the early detection of serious respiratory illnesses other than influenza, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Apparent clusters could be evaluated for their potential public health importance, considering data quality, magnitude of effect, and distribution of cases by person, place, and time [3] . Officials might decide to consult with health care providers in affected areas, initiate a traditional public health investigation, reallocate healthcare resources, or target interventions (e.g., vaccination) to reduce disease spread.",38.74418392293633,16.63256503025237

The selection of a credible spokesperson facilitates effective information dissemination as the public receive information from diverse sources during the uncertain and chaotic situation of a health crisis. A study of public perceptions of information sources concerning bioterrorism, before and after anthrax attacks, indicated the importance of national and regional health officials as spokespersons in this event. 17 In response to the anthrax attacks of 2001, selecting credible spokespersons was found to be one of the challenges for the CDC, 18 and the use of multiple spokespersons and poor message control were found to result in the loss of CDC credibility. 19 A recent study regarding public health officials as potential spokespeople revealed that news stories containing interviews with public health officials were 15.2 times more likely to report quality information, after controlling for station affiliate or geographic location. 20 The characteristics and performance of official spokespersons would influence the public's actions and their perception and trust during crisis communication. 7, 13 In 2003, the first serious newly emerging infectious disease of the 21st century, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), struck Taiwan and spread through the health care system. 21, 22 Taiwan was added to the travel alert list by the World Health Organization from May 21 to July 5 of that year. Taiwan's number of SARS cases was the third highest in the world, after China and Hong Kong. 23 An increase of international media coverage due to the uncertain nature and rapid spread of the SARS pandemic was observed. 24 The SARS pandemic had a major impact on Taiwan, with the Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital shutting down due to the occurrence of a mass infection, and largescale community quarantine. 21, 25, 26 The demand for news from the government was huge and the media scrutiny was strict. Influenced by media reporting, there was widespread fear and panic among the public. 26 The spokespersons' performance in front of a television camera and with reporters would have great impacts on delivering needed and correct information for disease prevention and control. 15 It is noted that, as a newly emerging infectious disease, the public understanding of the SARS pandemic was shaped in large part by the performance of public health officials as spokespersons for the national and local health departments as well as by the medical institutions through the daily press conference during the crisis period.",39.927419297146386,15.143102172301864

Such measures always require that we address questions of whether the health threats, their severity and transmissibility all justify depriving individuals of their liberty. these questions cannot be answered without confronting the tension between the interests of the individual and those of the collective. if SarS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) taught us anything, it was how difficult it is to make such decisions in the face of uncertainty. it might turn out in retrospect that the quarantines we impose when faced with a potential epidemic are more extensive than necessary. But in the face of an evolving threat, public health officials have no choice but to weigh personal liberty against potential grave threats (gostin et al, 2003). t o this point i have focused on infectious diseases, which compel us to address the powers of public health when there is a direct risk or a potential risk to third parties. But the scope of public health in industrial and post-industrial societies extends to chronic diseases (Knowles, 1977) . Many such conditions involve lifestyle choices; patterns of behaviour which, in the first instance, harm oneself. What is the legitimate role of the state in modifying, discouraging, burdening or even prohibiting behaviours that increase both morbidity and mortality? at stake here is the question of paternalism. is it appropriate for the State to impose restrictions on competent adults in order to protect them from harming themselves? those who are inspired by the tradition of John Stuart Mill answer with a resounding 'no'. they claim that public health officials can educate and warn, but not compel. as these ideas have gained wide influence, advocates of public health often need to assert that they intervene because the social consequences or negative externalities of certain behaviours warrant intervention; thus, self-regarding harms are transformed into other-regarding harms. in any event, the state seeks to use its authority to change individual behaviour. two examples will illustrate this point. it has long been known that wearing helmets Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; www.cdc.gov).",37.834308790251775,15.062890998999086

Biggs, when reflecting on the controversies that had greeted his efforts to mandate the reporting of tuberculosis cases-as he moved forward to begin the surveillance of sexually transmitted diseases in the early twentieth century-remarked that, ""[t]he ten year long opposition to the reporting of tuberculosis will doubtless appear a mild breeze compared with the stormy protest against the sanitary surveillance of the venereal diseases"" (Biggs, 1913) . Despite the existence of much opposition, the reporting of cases by name to local and state health departments and to special confidential registries ultimately became part of the tradition and practice of public health. u S courts almost always deferred to public health authorities that have deprived individuals of their liberty in the name of public health. one uS state high court declared at the beginning of the twentieth century that, ""[i]t is unquestionable that the legislature can confer police powers upon public officers for the protection of the public health. the maxim Salus populi suprema lex is the law of all courts in all countries. the individual right sinks in the necessity to provide for the public good"" (parmet, 1985) . Even more remarkably, a plenary grant of authority was still found to be constitutional in the 1960s. in upholding the detention of a person with tuberculosis pursuant to a statute that provided virtually no procedural protections, a california appellate court declared in 1966 that, ""[h]ealth regulations enacted by the state under its police power and providing even drastic measures for the elimination of disease…in a general way are not affected by constitutional provisions, either of the state or national government."" t he breadth of powers that public health authorities had enjoyed remained virtually unchallenged through most of the twentieth century, but finally came under increasing scrutiny during the last decades of that era. the development of a robust jurisprudence of privacy, and the ""due process revolution"", which extended rights to prisoners, mental patients and others under the authority of the state, ultimately questioned the long-held assumptions that had protected public health from constitutional scrutiny. the groundwork for this profound change was laid in the transformations that occurred in american politics, law and culture during the 1960s and 1970s.

Efforts to control smallpox, which involved compulsory vaccination, acted as a rallying point for groups and individuals motivated both by anti-government ideology and concrete fears of the physical harm that sometimes resulted from the procedure. anti-vaccine organizations throughout the uSa were driven, among other things, by opponents of germ theory and groups generally opposed to government interference in their claims to privacy. in Milwaukee (Wi, uSa), for example, forceful application of the State's mandatory vaccination law sparked riots among the city's large german immigrant population in the 1890s.

During the Ebola outbreak considerable work was undertaken on development of possible Ebola vaccines, with WHO coordinating international efforts for development of new interventions. 54 The potential for crises to harness efforts and innovations for public health is significant as is demonstrated by the announcement in late 2016 of the trial results of a potential vaccine for Ebola. 55 In 2016, the WHO developed a blueprint for research and development to prevent epidemics, 56 an approach that is in line with the recommendations of the various expert reviews of the Ebola response for accelerated R&D for global public health emergencies. 57 The R&D Blueprint focuses on three approaches: (i) 'improving coordination and fostering an enabling environment', (ii) 'accelerating Research and Development processes', and (iii) 'Developing new norms and standards tailored to of Health Preparedness and Response at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the one health approach to risk involves, 'not just to focus on humans but also the implicated animals and the environment to identify potentially novel prevention strategies', Ali Khan with William Patrick, The Next Pandemic: On the front Line against Humankind's Gravest Dangers the epidemic context'. 58 The publication in 2016 by WHO of Guidance for Managing Ethical Issues in Infectious Disease Outbreaks will assist these efforts by providing guidance on a range of important issues including research during emergencies, datasharing, biobanking of samples, and emergency use of unproven interventions, 59 issues which all came to the fore during the Ebola outbreak. 60 While pandemic response capacity in terms of R&D is being addressed globally, IHR core capacities are specified at the national level. The building of such capacity at the national level is multi-layered and resource demanding, so countries vary greatly in their ability (or willingness) to build capacities such as having enough or sufficiently proximate access to testing laboratories. 61 This is especially the case for developing countries in regions such as South-East Asia, where implementation of the IHRs is patchy due to resource and logistical challenges. 62 To assist the region to meet the IHR's mid-2014 deadline for development of core capacities, the Asia-Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) was developed, originally in 2005 and updated in 2010. 63 APSED has provided a valuable framework to support development of IHR core capacities in the region with 19 out of 27 States Parties reporting that they have met the IHR core capacity requirements, 64 and a 2015 evaluation showing establishment of event-based surveillance by 85% of Member States; with 92% having 'a rapid response team and risk communication plans for emergencies; and 95% of national reference laboratories have participated in external quality assessment'. 65 The challenges associated with building capacity are significant. Although the IHR require countries to build certain core capacities within their health systems, the achievement of IHR core capacities remains uneven 66 sparking debate over the best means of ensuring compliance with IHR requirements, including consideration of the best means of assessing the national capacities required by the IHR. Commenting that 'When the health of all is at stake, information must be validated through some form of peer review or other external assessment', 67 the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel considered the system of voluntary self-assessment of IHR core capacities to be 'unacceptable' and recommended costed and independently assessed plans for development of IHR core capacities, an approach that has also been recommended by other international expert panels. 68 Importantly, there has been a shift away from viewing IHR compliance as a point-in-time assessment of compliance to one of on-going capacity building and continual improvement. Noting with concern the fact that 'only approximately one-third of States Parties have indicated that they have met the minimum [IHR] core capacity requirements', the Report of the Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on IHR Implementation concluded that 'work to develop, strengthen and maintain the core capacities under the IHR should be viewed as a continuing process for all countries'. 69 The Review Committee also recommended external evaluations rather than self-assessment. 70 Following from these recommendations the WHO has developed a Joint External Evaluation Tool to assess the capacity of countries to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats. 71 Under the Joint External Evaluation the process of evaluation begins with completion of a survey by countries using their own self-reported data, which is provided to the joint external evaluation (JEE) team of national and international experts. Following a visit by the JEE team to the host country the JEE team draft a report on the country's capabilities and challenges. 72 National capacity to meet IHR core capacities is assessed on a 5-point scale: (i) no capacity, (ii) limited capacity, (iii) developed capacity, (iv) demonstrated capacity, and (v) sustainable capacity. 73 The resulting report is shared with the host country, and with the country's permission, stakeholders, in order to facilitate international support for implementation, circulate best practices, and promote accountability. 74 The development of the JEE tool is an important step towards greater transparency and accountability of the assessment of IHR core capacities. However, without substantial funding to support the realisation of core capacities, it is likely that many countries will continue to struggle to strengthen their national capacities.",35.667674844316906,12.78532695901721

Those forces are still at work. Table 1 is a summary of some of the economic forces, including the rise of managed care organizations and their attendant accumulation of bargaining power with reference laboratories. In the face of ever-rising health care costs, hospitals are enduring unrelenting pressure to reduce laboratory costs, resulting in the formation of consortium laboratories among hospital groups, referrals of specimens to private reference laboratories, closings of smaller hospital laboratories, and reductions in laboratory staff. Table 2 shows the forces at work for clinical laboratories, which are fighting battles on two fronts to maintain staff levels against further erosion. Management is asking for workforce reductions, while fewer qualified applicants are available for open positions. With the closing of many medical technology schools over the past two decades, graduating medical technologists, clinical laboratory scientists, and technicians number less than half of projected workforce needs. At the same time, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has placed new demands for secure patient information handling, adding another burden on laboratory staff (1, 2) . Table 3 lists the forces at work with public health laboratories. While engaged in traditional public health activities, these laboratories are experiencing multiple new pressures, including HIPAA and CLIA regulatory compliance issues, the need to be prepared for analytic response to bioterrorism acts, loss of state funding with a parallel need to bill Medicaid for patient testing and provide testing on a fee-for-service basis.

Outbreaks caused by Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., E. coli O157, and Camplylobacter and Listeria spp. are detected, and the numbers of cases are limited when the incriminated food product is determined and recalled. Clinical laboratories are being encouraged to refer such pathogens quickly, rather than letting a group of isolates accumulate for convenient transport to a state laboratory, where outbreaks of foodborne illness can be identified rapidly, resulting in limitations on the extent of outbreaks (7) . PFGE patterns uploaded by public health laboratories to the CDC PulseNet database are examined by epidemiologists looking for the appearance of clusters that cross state borders. Numerous multi-state and national foodborne-illness outbreaks have been uncovered that could not have been detected by other means. PulseNet works because clinical laboratories are effective in culturing agents of foodborne illness and referring these isolates quickly to public health laboratories that perform PFGE typing, conduct a statewide analysis, and then upload this information to the CDC database for nationwide analysis. This partnership has raised the level of detection of foodborne illness to unprecedented levels, virtually ensuring that no multistate outbreak of foodborne illness of any significant magnitude will go undetected. When three state laboratories determine a strain to be the same by PFGE typing, the recovery of a single isolate by each of three clinical microbiologists in three different states might be enough to detect a nationwide food problem.",36.41793331029016,13.748509620703253

PROHIBIT aims to analyse existing guidelines and practices to prevent healthcare associated infections (HAI) in Europe, to identify factors that influence compliance with best practices and to test the effectiveness of interventions of known efficacy. WP 2 provides a review of current national and subnational (regional) European guidelines for the prevention of C. difficile infections (CDI) as well as an overview on surveillance systems and public reporting of CDI. Methods: HAI surveillance National Contact Points (NCP) of the ECDC and other HAI experts in 34 countries (27 EU member states -whereby UK counts as 4 countries, Croatia, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) were asked to provide their national/subnational guidelines for CDI prevention. A review of the guidelines as well as a comparison with existing ECDC guidance was conducted. In addition a questionnaire was developed to gather information about national surveillance systems and practices of public reporting. Results: Eighteen of 34 European countries have a national/subnational guideline for CDI prevention. England, Northern Ireland and Wales follow the same guideline. The oldest guideline dates back to 1995, all others were published within the past 4 years. Seven of the 16 guidelines rate the scientific level of supporting evidence and strength of recommendation. All but one guideline explicitly recommend placing symptomatic patients in a single room whenever possible. Cleaning or disinfection of frequently touched surfaces is recommended in all guidelines. However, only 13 include specific recommendation about disinfectants; out of these 11 prefer chlorine based solutions as specified in the ECDC guidance of 2008. There is variation in hand hygiene recommendations. Most guidelines favour hand washing with soap and water. Alcoholic hand rub is mostly mentioned as an additional task to eradicate other pathogens. Thirteen countries providing a CDI guideline also run a national surveillance system for the disease. In Belgium, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Ireland participation is compulsory for hospitals. In the UK and Ireland public reporting of CDI rates of individual hospitals has been established since 2007 and 2008, respectively. Conclusions: Although CDI is recognized as a major challenge in infection control only half of the European countries presently provide a guideline for CDI prevention. Furthermore, there is important variation in scope and detailing of the recommendations. The majority of guidelines do not rate the scientific level or strength of recommendation. Countries with mandatory participation in a national surveillance system have introduced public reporting of CDI rates for hospitals.",44.56986656830899,16.279747453492554

A third perspective is that when infectious disease outbreaks occur in developing countries, these countries are unlikely to have adequately resourced and staffed health care facilities capable of addressing the spread of the disease and managing those who are already infected.

This new era started in 1975 when a small group of scientists, recognizing the potential for recombinant DNA technology to work for and against humankind, met at Asilomar to discuss a way forward [1] . A self-imposed moratorium on recombinant DNA research gave way to experimentation following the principles of the Asilomar Conference, and codes of practice formulated by national bodies in various countries with significant input from scientists [2] . This resulted in the development of a transparent, best-practices system of science that assured the potential of recombinant DNA research could be achieved in a safe manner, and remains a model for regulation of science by scientists [3] . In the United States, the first iteration of the Recombinant DNA Research Guidelines (National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines) were drafted with public input in 1976 by a National Institutes of Health federal advisory committee that eventually became known as the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) (see also Chapter 12) [4] . Initially the RAC reviewed all Principal Investigator (PI)-initiated proposals (referred to as registration documents) that involved recombinant DNA, but since 1978 the review and approval of most registration documents has been conditionally delegated to the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at research establishments (see also Chapters 2 and 12) . The drafted NIH Guidelines were not static and were modified as new technologies were developed, and as our understanding of risk evolved from intuitive to empirical based on new knowledge. Led by CDC and NIH initiatives, the NIH Guidelines were the starting point in a partnership with the life sciences community to develop a code of practices for biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories. In 1984 this collaboration resulted in the publication of Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) [5] .",42.15725506985284,13.391650232428649

The rise of nonstate-sponsored terrorism in the latter part of the last century, the recognition that biotechnology was pervasive, and that life sciences research had a dual-use nature, required new approaches to identify and evaluate the research risk. In response to this and other threats, the government enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (see also Chapters 1 and 2) . Together this legislation made it illegal to possess biological agents or toxins for nonpeaceful purposes.

Because implementation of this legislation could have the unintended consequence of making the United States more vulnerable to bioterrorism by slowing or blocking the development of the very diagnostics, prophylactics and therapeutics that are needed to protect the country from bioterrorism, the National Research Council of the National Academies of Sciences formed the Committee on Research Standards and Practices to Prevent the Destructive Applications of Biotechnology.

With SARS, external efforts to elicit cooperation in targeted countries had to operate without a powerful international institution. The WHO is no IMF. It does not have the Fund's demanding agenda for reform, high level of support from key states, or leverage as gatekeeper of resources. The WHO lacked the authority to require member countries to take steps to contain SARS. Member states' diseasereporting obligations extended only to a few listed illnesses. WHO provisions on international travel were inadequate, weakly balancing limits on states' latitude to impede commerce and mobility with their need for authority to take the drastic exclusionary measures that SARS seemed to require. 8 Initially unable to move Beijing to grant its teams access to affected areas, the WHO precious weeks in its mission to understand SARS' origin and spread. PRC opposition confined the WHO to dealing with Taipei indirectly, through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, until Beijing finally acquiesced to the WHO's sending a mission to Taiwan. Amid what some saw as implausible reported patterns of infection in China, worries arose that the WHO was being fatally restricted by PRC authorities. 9 The WHO has, however, escaped the resentment, charges of disregarding national sovereignty, condemnation for pursuing an inappropriate agenda with little regard for its consequences, and accusations of serving as the agent of Western domination that dogged the post-Asian financial crisis IMF. WHO assistance has been welcome or at least tolerated in several SARS-affected places, and its advice continues to have widespread credibility. But the lack of ire at the WHO also reflects the organization's inability to impose its will on states. SARS focused attention on international public health threats that can be as dangerous as the illiberal trade policies and irresponsible monetary policies that the WTO and IMF police. It prompted modest steps to create a more institutionally robust international public health structure and accelerated a long-term project to strengthen the WHO. WHO has acquired new powers to report promptly on disease outbreaks based on unofficial information and is also gaining clearer authority to issue global health alerts (as it did for SARS) and send teams to assess member states' measures to contain international health threats. 10 Such changes do not, however, portend an international public health regime resembling the international trade and monetary regimes. As the IMF's and WTO's histories make clear, states do not easily achieve the levels of cooperation, willingly provide the resources, or lightly undertake the cessions of sovereignty necessary to create such strong institutions. Any international response to a recrudescence of SARS or new public health threats will have to rely, for the foreseeable future, on a weak WHO and ad hoc multilateral cooperation.",41.4265780169732,16.948700906995764

The Public Health Emergency Response Regulations defined four categories of such events: (1) serious epidemics, (2) mass diseases with unknown causes, (3) large scope food or profession poisoning, and (4) other events that can severely affect public health, for example, leaking of infectious bacteria from laboratories. The public health alert system in China has three levels: yellow alert, orange alert, and red alert. Fig. 1 depicts the structure of this alert system. Two levels of public health emergency response plans are triggered by emergency alerts: the provincial and the national. If the public health emergency is confined within a certain region of a province, the provincial plan will be appropriate. If the public health emergency is diffused across provinces and endangers the national public health, the national plan will be needed. Specifically, in the event of a yellow alert, the provincial public health emergency response will become ready; in the event of an orange alert, a provincial public health emergency response will be started or the national emergency response will be ready; in the event of a red alert, the national emergency response plan will be activated. The national public health emergency response plan signifies the highest level of public health threat, and China responds to this type of crisis by gathering relevant departments in the State Council and military to form a national emergency command center. One of the leaders of the State Council, that is, the premier or a vice premier, will be appointed as the commander to direct actions resolving the emergency. The command center co-ordinates and allocates national resources, makes major deci-sions, determines outward statements in press conferences, and possibly resorts to police and military forces. On the other hand, the provincial public health emergency plan is determined by the provincial government. A command center with the provincial government leader as the commander will be organized to direct emergency response activities. The difference between the national plan and the provincial plan is mainly the scope of the response activities. In addition, it should be noted that when a public health emergency response plan becomes ready, it does not necessarily have to be activated. In this scenario, the major task would be to continue carrying out disease surveillance and epidemiological investigation to examine how the emergency develops. Related stakeholders are informed to make preparations and some resources might be allocated. But if the emergency shows no sign of escalation or is controlled before it escalates, the alert would be cancelled. The major responsibilities of the MOH are supervising and co-ordinating a wide range of activities relating to the emergency, such as organizing public health surveillance and reporting, applying for approval to start the national public health emergency response plan from the State Council, organizing and co-ordinating professional organizations to conduct field investigations, treating infected patients, tracing, sterilizing, or quarantining people who were in contact with infected patients, developing technological standards, declaring new infectious disease as legal infectious disease according to pertinent laws (only legal infectious diseases can trigger public health emergency alerts), and ",37.0853189211122,14.564852946337176

After all, the internet was born on public infrastructure with military funding. The United States could have built a focal point for cyber intelligence inside the government, like the CDC.

To address this concern, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct an analysis of the potential reuse of disposable N95FFR and N95 respirator/surgical masks. During this analysis, the IOM found that the demand for N95 respirators by the health care sector alone could be over 90 million for a 42-day influenza pandemic outbreak. 1 This analysis was consistent with the observation at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Canada, where 18,000 N95FFRs were used daily during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. 2 Current respirator manufacturing techniques and practices make it difficult to increase production to meet unexpected demand.

Despite extensive planning, the use of evidence to develop policies was complicated by several factors. Public health officials had to make decisions quickly, often when information was still being gathered. Coordination was necessary across multiple levels of public health (international, federal, provincial, local) and sectors (hospitals, schools, workplaces) .

Active surveillance involves a regular, systematic effort to contact reporting sources or to review records within an institution to ascertain information on the occurrence of newly diagnosed diseases or infections. An example of an active surveillance system for foodborne illnesses is FoodNet, which operates as part of CDC's Emerging Infections Program. 56 Active laboratory-based surveillance for confirmed cases of Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio increased from five sites, covering 5% of the U.S. population in 1996 to 10 sites covering approximately 15% of the population in 2007. Each clinical laboratory in the surveillance catchment areas is contacted weekly or monthly to ensure that all confirmed infections under surveillance have been reported. These data have been extremely useful in establishing national estimates for the burden of foodborne illness in the United States and for monitoring trends in the incidence of specific foodborne agents. Passive surveillance relies on the individual clinician or laboratory to initiate the report. For many diseases of public health importance, passive surveillance can be almost as comprehensive as active surveillance. Although surveillance systems are labeled as active or passive based on how cases are reported, all surveillance systems require an active review and analysis of reported cases, with dissemination of results to key stakeholders. 44 Two key qualities of community-based surveillance for infectious diseases that must be considered when interpreting surveillance data are representativeness and timeliness. These qualities vary by disease and depend on multiple factors. The first factor of importance is that the patient must seek medical attention. It is not common for persons with mild or limited illnesses to seek medical attention. Second, the physician must seek laboratory testing of appropriate clinical specimens to confirm the diagnosis. Third, the laboratory must have the capability to identify the agent. Fourth, the physician and laboratory must report the clinical and laboratory findings to public health officials in a timely manner. Fifth, the availability of molecular subtyping techniques such as PFGE and the ability to compare PFGE patterns electronically through the national computer network PulseNet can greatly increase both the sensitivity and the specificity of pathogenspecific surveillance. Even in states where laboratory-based infectious disease reporting is required, there may be confusion among physicians and laboratory officials regarding who has the responsibility for reporting. Finally, public health agencies must have the resources to conduct timely and routine follow-up of such reports, to ascertain basic case demographic and other relevant data. Failure at any step of this process results in loss of information to the community-based surveillance system.",36.77882710237232,14.48536552090073

However, officials responsible for developing such plans must often rely on information and trends provided via very complex modeling (requiring supercomputers so that only a few cases can be considered due to resource constraints) or, at the opposite extreme, modeling that has incorporated very drastic simplifying assumptions so as to be computationally practical. Moreover, such plans are developed with only a few specific scenarios or preevent concepts in mind and often ignore the fact that the solutions dealing with a pandemic are very dependent on its underlying traits and actual characteristics, which cannot be known with any certainty a priori. Thus, there is a critical need to better equip public health officials responsible for pandemic influenza planning, or planning for other mass casualty events, with sophisticated yet easy to use tools that capture the complex elements, especially individual social behaviors, of traumatic events and that can also adjust as additional information is obtained and conditions evolve over time.",39.128949251935296,14.466585094241195

However, these models are typically self-contained, unavailable to health care officials, or unlinked to any interactive visual interfaces. What is needed now are tools to help health officials prepare for an outbreak and disseminate information to the public in the event of a possible pandemic situation. Various modeling tools do exist which are meant to aid in pandemic preparation. FluAid is provided by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in order to assist state and local level planners in preparing for the next influenza pandemic [1] . This software provides a range of estimates of impact in terms of deaths, hospitalizations, and outpatients visits. FluSurge is a spreadsheet-based model which provides hospital administrators and public health officials estimates of the surge in demand for hospital-based services during the next influenza pandemic [12] . While these simulation tools provide excellent statistical support to planners, they are fairly restrictive in their scope, and do not provide any spatiotemporal support. Work done by Germann et al. [19] begins addressing this shortcoming. They developed a simulation which allows various intervention strategies to be set and simulations to be run. Results are displayed via a heat map displaying illness attack rates over the entire nation, and charts of incidence rates. However, this is a complex, large scale simulation which requires a supercomputing platform in order to run. User interaction is largely absent, and investigating the effect of decision changes requires a re-running of the entire simulation. In response, our application provides a desktop pandemic modeling tool with interactive, spatiotemporal support. This allows users to observe conditions evolving over time and space.

Understanding this process to identify barriers and modifiable influences is important to improve the response to future emergencies. The purpose of this study is to examine the H1N1 pandemic decision-making process in Canada with an emphasis on the use of evidence for public health decisions. Using semi-structured key informant interviews conducted after the pandemic (JulyeNovember 2010) and a document analysis, we examined four highly debated pandemic policies: use of adjuvanted vaccine by pregnant women, vaccine priority groups and sequencing, school closures and personal protective equipment. Data were analysed for thematic content guided by Lomas' policy decision-making framework as well as indicative coding using iterative methods. We interviewed 40 public health officials and scientific advisors across Canada and reviewed 76 pandemic policy documents. Our analysis revealed that pandemic pre-planning resulted in strong beliefs, which defined the decision-making process. Existing ideological perspectives of evidence strongly influenced how information was used such that the same evidentiary sources were interpreted differently according to the ideological perspective. Participants recognized that current models for public health decision-making failed to make explicit the roles of scientific evidence in relation to contextual factors. Conflict avoidance theory explained policy decisions that went against the prevailing evidence. Clarification of roles and responsibilities within the public health system would reduce duplication and maintain credibility.

The IHR are framed around the assumption that disease is a security issue. 34 However, the danger of subsuming disease control within foreign and national security is that the focus is on security rather than on health. Wider national and international interests may not always coincide with public health. Global public health may not always coincide with the security concerns of individual states, particularly more powerful states. McInnes and Lee note that policy responses to the SARS epidemic elicited a 'garrison mentality' whereby strict border controls and control of movement of persons became central to disease containment, with consequences for the movement of persons, goods and services. 35 It has been widely argued that the promotion and protection of human rights is inextricably linked to the promotion and protection of public health, and that lack of respect for the rights and dignity of persons or groups of persons can increase their vulnerability to disease contagion. 36, 37 The importance of human rights to health has been acknowledged in the revised IHR Article 3, which requires that the IHR be implemented with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons. As Mann argues, '.the human rights framework is indispensable both for analyzing the central societal issues which must be confronted and for guiding the direction of societal transformation needed to promote and protect health.' 38 States have a significant number of non-medical tools at their disposal in a disease pandemic, and public health law reform has been undertaken with pandemic influenza in mind. Public health legislation around the world now authorizes a wide range of social distancing powers and compulsory screening, examination and treatment measures. In addition, much public health legislation provides for the possibility of some limited emergency measures. Nevertheless, some European states have proposed the use of emergency powers legislation to provide exceptional powers in the case of a pandemic; powers which will inevitably constrain the rights of individuals. The evidence base for the need for such exceptional powers has yet to be established, and in the absence of such evidence, there is concern that too heavy a hand will result in long-term harm to public trust in the exercise of population-based disease prevention strategies.",44.411684793354844,16.08548788104715

Of course, such issues are not unique to Europe, but the nature of Europe as a continent and as a legal entity creates particular complications for the ways in which law might best be used to create a coordinated European pandemic disease strategy. One unexpected benefit of the pandemic threat has been the renewed interest in exploring the role of law as a communicable disease tool, and in the examination of the range of public health legal approaches across Europe.

One issue that arises from the lack of border controls within Europe is the disparity in levels of disease preparedness across Europe. In 2004, 10 new member states joined the EU, eight of which are former communist countries in central and eastern Europe (Slovenia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia). These states are characterized by a history of underfunding of health and surveillance systems, unreliability of access to drugs, continuing increase in diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and inadequate public health responses to disease. 46 Since these states have entered into the EU, citizens can cross borders into other, better-resourced states. In the context of a pandemic, this could mean an influx of persons who are possible disease carriers from poor states with a frail public health system and with insufficient medicines, to other EU states, putting citizens at risk and draining health resources in those states. This creates difficult choices for host countries in terms of the assistance they offer.

In the context of pandemic influenza, it is considered that social measures authorized by law will be at least as important as medical interventions. 3 Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic suggests that compulsory home isolation and quarantine were not particularly effective disease control measures because of the difficulty in diagnosing mild cases. Nor were such measures likely to be feasible beyond the initial cases. 4 However, compulsory interventions such as school closures, closure of public places and restriction of mass gatherings, along with disease surveillance and hygiene improvement, have proved effective both in influenza outbreaks and in the SARS epidemic. 5 International and EU instruments require states to undertake such measures, many of which will require a legal underpinning. The requirement of compliance with the revised IHR and the globalization of disease information and exchange have prompted many states to revise their public health laws. Other states, which had no public health legislation, have now enshrined public health laws in legislative form. These initiatives were long overdue. Across Europe, as elsewhere, national public health laws tended to be old, based on flawed science, and to predate contemporary understandings and protection of human rights. 6, 7 The allocation of responsibility for public health practice and the role of the state in regulating private behaviours have very different histories across Europe. 8 Not surprisingly, states have adopted very different positions on the issue of the extent to which constraints can be placed upon individuals for the public benefit. Earlier research on European national public health laws in relation to tuberculosis 9 enabled the identification of four different 'families' of public health legislative models in Europe. These were: authoritarian (the enforcement of a high number of compulsory control measures); moderate (the enforcement of predominantly compulsory control measures without recourse to prevention powers such as compulsory vaccination or population screening); preventive (where compulsory provisions were oriented towards preventive measures, including screening, medical examination and/or vaccination, rather than compulsory treatment or detention); and the laissez faire model, where few or no compulsory measures existed.",48.24200517085844,15.14883424393017

In a large-scale epidemic or attack, public health officials may set up temporary stations for mass vaccination and prophylaxis. However, many patients may still appear at clinics requesting prophylaxis; 3. triage who gets treated in a large outbreak/attack. Internists will have to prioritize who should receive treatment, especially when necessary resources and skilled manpower are limited. Knowing when and how to ration treatments can be challenging, particularly in chaotic conditions. Although Internists may feel compelled to acquiesce to every patient's needs, their primary responsibility in public health emergencies is the public. 24 While clear guidelines have not been established and rationing decisions are rather controversial, certain groups such as essential personnel (e.g., health care workers, police, fire fighters, and other individuals integral in responding to a public health disaster) should receive priority. Essential personnel are needed to prevent more casualties and fatalities and could spread contagious diseases to many other people; 4. treat mental health consequences. Public health disasters can result in significantly increased mental health problems including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorders.

These agreements are designed to balance the competing demands for domestic regulatory autonomy and the global harmonization of product standards as well as prevent imposition of protectionist policies. Some critics contend that the harmonization provisions of these global agreements interfere with the sovereign authority of states to implement domestic public health standards and stop nations from taking preventive measures against health risks in the absence of scientific certainty. Others favor the harmonization provisions arguing that higher and more costly safety standards in high-income states can be protectionist measures that act as barrier to access to the markets of high-income states. This issue has been hotly contested, particularly in the realms of environmental health and of product standards for food safety.",37.439478226627884,15.01278286560783

As we note, one solution was to pass some of the responsibility for implementing public health measures on to the airlines and their passengers. After all, it was the commercial airlines that were required to carry out disinsection, and it was the passengers who were responsible for ensuring that they carried valid documentation detailing the inoculations they had received prior to travel.

Active monitoring consists of direct public health contact (telephone or in person), for example, once a day for exposed persons to assess for symptoms and address any needs. Passive monitoring relies on the affected person's contacting the health authorities if symptoms develop. Methods of monitoring depend on the exposure risk and capacity of the public health infrastructure. Regardless of the type of monitoring recommended, all individuals in contact with a potentially infectious person need to be advised of symptoms and what to do if symptoms develop.

This can be achieved by: telling people what is happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling. Health officials charged with implementing quarantine, who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security, should also remember that not everyone is in the same situation. If the quarantine experience is negative, the results of this Review suggest there can be longterm consequences that affect not just the people quarantined but also the healthcare system that administered the quarantine and the politicians and public health officials who mandated it. and Newcastle University.

Covert events may occur insidiously and with nonspecific clinical syndromes; thus, they may go unnoticed for several days or weeks. Whereas overt outbreaks would warrant immediate notification of public health officials and LRN reference laboratories, potential covert events might be initially evaluated internally by clinicians, infection control personnel, and the sentinel laboratory. Although hospital and public health authorities should be notified as soon as a select agent is considered, an LRN-confirmed result would be needed to initiate a formal public health response. Key epidemiological clues to suspicious emergency events include sharp rises in the frequency or severity of communicable diseases (including those in animals), an unusual cluster or age distribution, occurrence of novel or rare diseases, presence or lack of an appropriate exposure history, travel to a location that has high-consequence disease transmission, unexplained deaths, or pathogens with unusual antimicrobial resistance.",36.2197919120732,13.85839418079655

Once local and international responders identified the virus, they took a year to interrupt its widespread transmission. By April 2016, Ebola had accounted for more than 28,000 cases and over 11,000 deaths. People around the world watched with increasing alarm, as this tragic course of events played out, and with concern that air travel could enable the virus to spread across continents. This epidemic highlighted not only the inadequacy of local health systems to recognise and respond but also that international organisations were not ready to provide timely expertise and resources to control the situation and ameliorate the virus's spread through the region. Had health officials identified Ebola in West Africa promptly, they could have minimised its impact on the lives and livelihoods of the populations of West Africa by implementing appropriate control procedures. Public health officials coined the term surveillance to describe systems they set up to watch out for and control occurrence of health threats. Just as police, for example, set up closed-circuit television devices and community watch programmes to detect and prevent crime, public health surveillance systems engage all possible means to detect unwanted health events and prevent them from escalating and damaging population health. While public health surveillance originated to control spread of infectious diseases such as plague and cholera, it has evolved to include some non-communicable diseases, occupational health and injuries as well as surveillance of biological, behavioural and social determinants of these conditions. We start by reviewing the public health need for surveillance and the development by the international community of regulations to control infectious diseases and other Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC).

When it receives an unofficial report, the WHO seeks verification from the States Parties in whose territory the event occurs. The director-general (D-G) has sole power to declare a PHEIC. In determining whether to declare a PHEIC, the D-G shall consider: (a) information provided by the State Party; (b) the decision instrument; (c) the advice of the Emergency Committee, which the D-G also has sole discretion to convene; (d) scientific principles and evidence; and (e) a risk assessment regarding human health, international spread, and interference with international traffic. If the D-G declares a PHEIC, she must issue temporary, nonbinding recommendations describing health measures States Parties should take. She is also empowered to terminate a PHEIC, which automatically expires after 3 months unless extended, modified, or terminated earlier.",32.4418626649047,13.683189593553818

In fi nancial terms, funding from diff erent partners is harmonised under one fi nancing plan with clear funding needs and gaps-another model for other programmes. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past-when tuberculosis services were not free-and the success in tuberculosis control over the past few yearswhen tuberculosis services have been free-have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS-eg, directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs-are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programmes. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them.

The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications. The access to such timely, crowd-sourced information on infected cases greatly facilitated the understanding of the epidemiology of an unknown disease, which is key in developing effective prevention and control measures. public health practitioners, social media surveillance could provide early warning for unusual public health events in a foreign country and serve as an additional source of epidemiological intelligence to complement conventional surveillance tools.

Through Global Alert and Response (GAR) Disease Outbreak News (DON) releases, the WHO kept the world updated with detailed, deidentified case information provided soon after they had been forwarded on to them from each country's Ministry of Health or equivalent, as per the transparency required by the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005. However there were often delays in the posting of such information, most notably during the Jeddah-2014 outbreak when no new case details were confirmed by the WHO as originating from KSA for more than six weeks. Cases announced via the KSA Ministry of Health website have often had data inconsistencies including errors, format variations, have often lacked key information including dates, have presented deaths with insufficient information to permit linkage with the announced case and over one hundred cases remain devoid of all key data, excluding them from most epidemiological analyses. This was a particular problem during periods when rapid case accumulation became a concern for the global community. When available, WHO DONs fill in vital missing detail, with additional important demographic data like age, sex or essential dates permitting improved understanding of when illness onset occurred, when cases were hospitalised, whether they were asymptomatic and if the newly announced case was a contact of another case, an animal or an animal product. However DONs are only effective when the underlying data is forwarded to the WHO. Such comprehensive data permits other calculations, for instance the likely laboratory turnaround time, the possibility for nosocomial spread occurring and the location of cases as a determining factor in whether a cluster has become an outbreak or a local epidemic. WHO data can be viewed by the public but are also relied upon by WHO Member States' epidemiology analysts. Such experts report to many levels of Health management and government who seek to understand threats to their own population so as to make the most informed judgements. The decisions which follow may include the need to raise alert levels, prepare laboratory capacity, create educational materials, free specific response funds, ramp up messaging, manage and alter border controls or issue travel alerts. The activities of the WHO have been essential for global preparedness against MERS. The WHO rapidly and comprehensively adopted, updated and publicly promoted diagnostic tools and testing algorithms, case definitions and guidelines for investigations, research study protocols, IPC guidance, travel advice, risk assessments and summary updates via a purpose-built coronavirus-focussed website. Their social media unit strove to answer questions posed by everyone and anyone through Twitter, which in turn allowed users to take control of further disseminating the information they found most interesting, informative, relevant or concerning to others in their social networks; a process that can also be informative to public health bodies who seek to provide their clients the detail they desire. The role of WHO as a nexus for collaboration laid the groundwork for the accumulation and advancement of knowledge about MERS and the MERS-CoV through the formation of, and reporting by, the IHR (2005) Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV. Their role is to advise the WHO Director-General on the need for action and, as yet, no Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been declared. The IHR Emergency Committee has met eight times to date. Upon request, the WHO has also sent risk assessment teams to the region to gauge the MERS situation. Gregory Härtl, Coordinator of the Department of Communications for the WHO, noted that ""the more answers public health experts can provide now, the greater the public's trust in these institutions will be if and when the virus should become easily transmissible between humans and cause more widespread morbidity and mortality"" (Hartl, 2013) . This is a comment that applies equally well to the emergence of any infectious disease. By comparison, officials within the KSA were widely and regularly criticised for moving slowly, shunning collaborations and failing to show proactive action in commencing local research into MERS and MERS-CoV (2014c; Editorial, 2014; Holmes, 2014; Kupferschmidt, 2014; Reuters, 2014; World Health Organization, 2014f) .",27.6235340956692,10.111859383176558

Past studies indicate the Australian media have a tendency to use alarmist headlines in matters relating to infectious disease (Holland, Blood, Imison, Chapman, & Fogarty, 2012) . Nonetheless our impression is that the Australian news media did not 'over-hype' the risks posed by Hendra virus; a finding that echoes UK media coverage of the recent Swine Flu event (Hilton & Hunt, 2011) . What is noteworthy however was the way politicians, interest groups and other 'policy entrepreneurs' used the media to challenge the established policy community surrounding public health, animal disease control and wildlife management to put controlling flying fox populations higher on the public agenda (Kingdon, 2011) . As the number of Hendra outbreaks increased in 2011, the values and expertise of public health officials, epidemiologists, wildlife ecologists and environmentalists were questioned, as was their current choice of actions. Several features of how Hendra outbreaks and debates about flying fox population control were reported in the media permitted opponents of the current policies and practices to reframe the issues, recast debate about what types of actions needed to be taken, and then prime the public as to how these actions could and should be justified in the face of imperfect scientific knowledge.

The precursor to this historic meeting was a keynote lecture in 1993 delivered by then AMA vice president M. Roy Schwartz, MD, entitled ""Medicine and Public Health: A Costly Estrangement."" 6 The meeting proved catalytic, and a second meeting on the importance of the new medicine and public health partnership followed in Washington DC. A broad group of medicine and public health organizations was represented, including the Association of Academic Health Centers, the Association of Schools of Public Health, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, and the National Association of County and City Health Officials. 7 A task force emerged, which met from 1994 to 1996 to define the scope of MPHI. It recommended seven critical shared agendas: (1) engaging the community, (2) changing the education process, (3) creating joint research efforts, (4) devising a shared view of health and illness, (5) working together in healthcare provision, (6) jointly developing healthcare assessment measures, and (7) translating initiative ideas into action. 8, 9 In a follow-up to the task force's work, a national congress was convened in Chicago during March 1996, with Ͼ400 delegates from across the nation in attendance. They represented a broad mix of interests from medicine and public health practice, academic leaders from both disciplines, and the insurance industry. The focus of the national Congress was small group work designed to build action steps for future MPHI activity upon the participants' return home. Ultimately, 19 states were funded via a competitive process under the rubric of the Cooperative Actions for Health Program provided through the Robert Wood Johnson (RWJ) Foundation and the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. 10 The University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center received funding to serve as the national MPHI program office. A profile of each state's project, as well as lessons learned through a formal evaluation, are documented in an MPHI monograph. 10 There were some impressive accomplishments from these early grants, including some that have stood the test of time. For example, in New York improvements in the reporting of infectious diseases to public health authorities led to the early identification of the first outbreak of West Nile virus in the Western Hemi-sphere. Additionally, a bicycle helmet campaign in Washington State increased helmet usage rates over 300%.

In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the spread of a novel H1N1 variety of influenza had reached Phase 6 pandemic levels [4] . These new and emerging diseases pose widespread public health risks and highlight the need for closer communications between health care providers and public health officials responsible for monitoring health risks.

The report 22 sets out basic competencies and curricula. This trend to a broader liberal education is being followed in Hong Kong, where the university curriculum is being extended to 4 years along the lines of the US and mainland Chinese model. Not only has a new BSc now been introduced at university level, 23 but public health has been added into the curriculum for high school students as part of liberal studies for all students, and a further module on health and social care management is also being taught in years 4-6 in middle school. 24 In the USA, there is a growing demand for public health undergraduate courses, and the Association of Schools of Public Health is in the process of devising undergraduate public health competencies. The Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium of Public Health is working to improve public health through the delivery of education, research and public health programmes by member institutions, and actively supports increasing undergraduate public health opportunities, stressing that public health education is more urgent for its region than the rest of the world and that a better system needs to be built, based on developments and experiments already occurring in other universities and other countries and regions. 25 ",38.25114715114145,15.210313457302432

The recent changes in viral pneumonia emergence and detection, particularly the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, highlighted the need for close contact between these worlds. The initial cases of H1N1 were detected through routine surveillance by sentinel providers. These providers sent reports back to local and state public health officials regarding the caseload of influenzalike illness, along with diagnostic samples for subtyping. Thus, when a sample returned as an unidentified subtype of influenza A, we were able to determine the first cases of this new virus. In addition, other unusual respiratory viruses can present initially as a severe febrile respiratory illness, often with respiratory failure in the ICU. And that close contact between critical care providers and public health officers is essential. Finally, studies illustrate the close association between seasonality and viral pneumonia. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for example, rarely present outside of the winter season. Public health providers can provide this information to critical care physicians, allowing for early treatment when the virus is circulating and additionally allowing conservative measures when it is not circulating. And finally, the relationship between advanced viral testing of respiratory secretions (for virus agents outside of the standard multiplex technology) often goes through public health.

Although PGFE is considered a reliable, discriminatory, and reproducible method, it is expensive and time consuming, making this technique difficult for hospitals to use as a routine form of support for infection-control practitioners in outbreak investigations (Weller, 2000a; Shopsin and Kreiswirth, 2001; Stranden et al., 2003) . Due to testing conditions, there is inherent gel-to-gel variability with PGFE, which makes it difficult to compare inter-institutional electrophoresis results. Public health laboratories have standardized PFGE for use in outbreak investigations, and digital imaging has provided some standardization and cross-gel comparative properties; still, the technique is relatively cumbersome and not practical in most hospital laboratories. With recent CDC and JCAHO recommendations to use molecular testing as the gold standard in investigation of hospital-acquired infections, hospitals are faced with difficult choices, referring specimens to reference laboratories or state public health laboratories for testing or investment in hospital-based infrastructure to support genotyping.

Early detection of public health risks is one of the core functions. In order to improve surveillance and detection, a better understanding of the health system conditions and their influencing factors are needed. The Israeli Ministry of Health/IHR National Focal Point held a workshop to elucidate health system conditions and their influencing factors that enable earlier detection. The workshop methodology employed a stepwise, small working group analysis approach to elucidate the conditions and their influencing factors affecting each stage of recognition, assessment, and reporting of infectious disease outbreaks, at the local, regional and national levels. In order to detect public health risks earlier, the detection process needs to be moved closer to the local communities and start with building capacity within communities. Building capacity and engaging with local and diverse communities requires significant changes in the governance approach and include information sharing, multi-sectoral communication and coordination across various levels before, during and after public health emergencies. Across the regions, low-, mid-and high-income countries seem to struggle more with governance and information sharing rather than with technical capacities and capabilities.",34.51905895072118,12.544988816584283

However, the field of health sector disaster response modeling lacks a coherent thematological or methodological organization. Such organization could assist modelers in understanding and addressing the requirements of end users, facilitate consistent and systematic reporting of model inputs and results, and promote the development of standardized methodological approaches --just as the Report from the Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine provides guidance for the field of costeffectiveness analysis. 6 This paper describes the range of models that have been developed for public health and medical responses to disasters and proposes a set of recommendations for developing and reporting the results of these models-something that has been lacking in the literature.

We describe exemplary and representative articles from the literature on applied decision support modeling for health sector disaster response, paying particular attention to the ways in which these articles differ from classic cost-effectiveness studies. 2) What methodologies have been and might be used for such models? We discuss the use of a range of modeling techniques for a variety of decision problems. 3) What are best practices * Decision making can be considered strategic, tactical, or operational based on the spatial and temporal range of the decisions.

On the one hand, the politics of public health influenced states' external relations deeply. To combat the epidemics of the 1660s, England interfered with the Dutch trading empire by imposing quarantines against vessels sailing from Amsterdam; about a 100 years later, Austria had completed a sanitary cordon over 1,600 kilometres along the lines of a former military cordon at its Eastern border (Rothenberg 1973: 16) ; and in the nineteenth century, the European powers established consular commissions in Alexandria or Constantinople for 'defending Europe from Asiatic infections' (Harrison 2013: 70) . On the other hand, public health had a tremendous impact on the internal politics of evolving nation states. A wide array of administrative practices, such as isolation, segregation, or urban planning, were led by the concern for health as a 'common good'an understanding that triggered regulatory reforms to set up systems of 'medical police' by the end of the eighteenth century in most European states (Carroll 2002) .

A 2010 case involving a tobacco dispute between Indonesia and the United States is illustrative. To comply with domestic legislation to prevent adolescent smoking, the United States banned imports of flavored cigarettes. Indonesia argued that the domestic legislation, by exempting 'menthol' from the list of flavors, discriminated against its clove cigarettes in favor of US-manufactured menthol cigarettes, which are the favored choice of American teens. This constituted a violation of WTO rules on national treatment (there should be no discrimination against 'like' imported goods). Indonesia further argued that there were 'less-trade-restrictive' ways (another WTO requirement) to meet the public health goal of reducing adolescent smoking than a ban on clove cigarette imports. The WTO dispute panel ruled with Indonesia on the first argument (nondiscrimination) but with the United States on the second (agreeing that a ban was a necessary public health policy). Provided there is no obvious discrimination, public health regulations appear to have growing latitude within (at least some) WTO (McGrady, 2012) . There is also greater public health attention being given to proposed trade and investment treaties, with efforts to ensure that before such treaties are finalized, public health concerns are given due consideration, and that 'policy space' for future public health regulation is assured, e.g., regarding trade or investment in food, alcohol, or other health-damaging commodities. The potential for a healthier governance of trade and investment treaties, however, remains constrained by the secrecy in which the treaties are negotiated, the privileging of business interests over public interests in informing government positions during negotiations, and the stilldominant assumption that liberalization is an inherently positive development for all countries involved.

Knowledgeable public health practitioners might have cautioned against overestimating the potential impact of managing contacts of SARS patients, and interpreted observations suggesting that infected people were not particularly infectious until acutely ill as an indication for managing cases instead.

Absent such observations, conveying complex and occasionally nonintuitive results supporting policy decisions to public health and medical professionals is challenging.

These activities require effective systems to identify salient information gaps (or potentially hazardous rumours and misinformation), craft and adapt messaging and rapidly disseminate it to the population.18 The dissemination of information is only a first step; risk communications must also be accepted and adopted by the public. Several factors influence public acceptance of official communications, including the population’s level of trust in authorities,19 as well as overall level of public education. Educated and literate populations are more likely to be aware of basic public health practices and risks, and to understand and respond to expert guidance for behavioural changes to limit disease risks.20

The modern era of “public health preparedness” had begun as did a “new normal” in public health that required active involvement in homeland security efforts on a basis of 24 hours, 7 days a week. Discussions around how federal dollars for preparedness should be allocated at the state and local levels led to the development of the ASTHO-NACCHO (National Association of County & City Health Officials) Joint Council. Convening health officers to discuss coordinated emergency response efforts to Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the H1N1 outbreak, and severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak laid the groundwork for ASTHO's role in supporting state and territorial health agencies and federal partners during public health disasters.

A clarification in 2003 specified when countries can import drugs produced elsewhere under a mechanism known as “compulsory licensing” (57). Despite the World Trade Organization's claim that the Doha Declaration removed the “final patent obstacle to cheap drug imports” (58, p. 1), the limited capacity of developing states to actually implement the available flexibilities, especially given the stricter protections found in many bilateral and regional trade agreements (known as “TRIPS+” measures), demonstrates the power of economic interests over public health considerations (59).

RISK, RIGHTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES","The levels of public trust in a particular national culture will also influence rights as risk perspectives.89 Lesley Jacobs, in a study of the divergent uses of quarantine in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Toronto during the SARS crisis, attributes the more extensive use of quarantine in Toronto to the particular legal consciousness of senior public health officials: ‘health security was weighed much more heavily than rights concerns … whereas in Hong Kong and Shanghai there was much more of an even balance’.90 But, even though there was dissent in Toronto, courts and human rights bodies were not used to raise concerns about rights violations. One federal public health official has speculated that:
The belief that the decisions about SARS by senior public officials, provided that they had a legal basis, would be made fairly was so deeply ingrained among the public that there was little need to question or scrutinize those decisions.91
Jacobs's explanation for the non-use of courts is that legal avenues of redress might not be seen as appropriate ‘where the health security of the community is at stake’.92 From an organisational risk perspective, this phenomenon could be used as a reason to dismiss rights as a risk and, more specifically, to downgrade the need for rights protection in preparedness planning and implementation. This, however, would be counter-productive. As James Childress and Ruth Gaare Bernheim have argued, ‘public justification, deliberation, and other relationship-building activities may be more important for biopreparedness than state power because they maintain and nurture civic ideals, cooperation, and trust’.93 Moreover, Childress and Gaare Bernheim's argument can be extended to encompass the role of the private sector in sustaining public trust during an emergency. To give just one example: an employer's policy on matters such as job security has a very real capacity either to aid or to hinder the extent of voluntary compliance with quarantine requirements.",42.20430241853936,14.745651022005381

As we see it, its defining stance will range from anxiety to outright opposition, and it absolutely will not share the optimism of the first response. For instance, faced with the latter's claims on ‘win-win’, its position is likely to be that preparedness distorts public health priorities, with negative consequences everywhere, but especially in developing states. Securitisation, it will argue, compromises the public's health as it clambers after public health as security. Moreover, even if one accepts the skewing of attention towards preparedness, isn't it the case—it will argue—that the preparedness project is out of balance?

Indeed, in evidence to a UK Parliamentary committee, David Fidler stated that:
Increasingly, the Gates Foundation is the first place people will pick up the phone to call; not the WHO. In fact, someone told me – and I do not know if this is true – that Bill Gates is now going to fly to Indonesia to help intervene in that controversy over virus sharing. Something has changed here.87
In federal states, the legal relationship between federal and local government may constitute rights as a risk in the public health emergency field. On the one hand, a strong states' rights tradition can hamper, or be used as an excuse by, federal government in developing particular national preparedness measures. On the other hand, however, where federal government seeks aggressively to assert its power and interfere with protected human rights, a tradition of strong states' rights could be a bulwark against such abuse.88",35.12355188519055,13.530757914946506

But before explaining why, we need to define ‘public health emergency preparedness’, in particular its impressive–sounding correlate, ‘global public health security’, and its less readily comprehensible subset, ‘public health emergency legal preparedness’. In the World Health Report 2007, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), described ‘global public health security’ as ‘the reduced vulnerability of populations to acute threats to health’.2 Later in the same report, more detailed definitions were provided:
Public health security is … the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimize vulnerability to acute public health events that endanger the collective health of national populations. Global public health security widens this definition to include acute public health events that endanger the collective health of populations living across geographical regions and international boundaries … .[G]lobal health security, or lack of it, may also have an impact on economic or political stability, trade, tourism, access to goods and services and, if they occur repeatedly, on demographic stability.3
The other term that requires some explanation is ‘public health emergency legal preparedness’. Stated shortly, this is all about having the right laws in place and then using them in the right way in a time of public health emergency.4 In other words, it is about both legal preparedness for, and response to, public health emergencies – it is both proactive and reactive. More generally, it can be said to be an essential part of both public and global public health security, and a subset of public health emergency preparedness.",34.166630942459925,12.881445302657891

Since 2014, the United States (US) has led an international effort to integrate its biodefense strategy for preempting an outbreak, and has committed to partner with other countries in order to achieve the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) goal for preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious disease threats [4].",25.77483909965286,9.491768738868386

Public health and life sciences on the one hand and security on the other hand were until a few years ago almost completely separated worlds. “Biologists and other life scientists were—unlike the physicists—not involved in security politics, except for a relatively limited group of biologists and other life scientists who were working in Defence laboratories in order to develop biological weapons or to contribute to biodefense research” (van der Bruggen 2009, p. 69).

This is confirmed by the American biologist Drew Endy. He estimates the risks for the short and medium term very low. “From a security perspective, many people are concerned that it is now possible to directly construct harmful pathogens from DNA sequence information. This seems to me a real but remote possibility, and is likely best addressed by improvements in our capacity to respond to emerging infectious diseases, natural or otherwise, and to our public health systems.

Rothstein & Talbott (2007) found that to make quarantine to be the most effective measure for limiting the spread of infection, compliance with quarantine regulations should be encouraged, that is, providing job security and income replacement. Wang et al. (2012) found that In the case of short reaction time, intra-population, such as patient isolation, are more effective than inter-population such as travel restrictions. Jefferson (2008) pandemic influenza (H1N1) and found those were effective to some extent. Rashid (2015) researched the public health policy of the 2009 pandemic influenza and concluded that the school closure, whether positive or passive, seemed to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the spread of influenza and delaying the peak of the epidemic, but it is related to high expenses of secondary school. Voluntary isolation and quarantine at home are also effective and acceptable measures, but it takes the risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Workplace-related interventions, such as work closure and work at home, are also moderately effective and acceptable, but it may have negatively impact on economy. Internal mobility restriction is only effective when extremely high restrictions (50% of travel) are imposed and mass gatherings which happened within 10 days before the epidemic peak is likely to increase the risk of transmission of influenzas. Rothstein (2015) compared the effectiveness of public health policies to intervene with infectious diseases, among which quarantine is one of the most aggressive and controversial measures that public health officials can take when trying to control an outbreak. Serious legal and ethical concerns have been raised because of restrictions on the movement of potentially large numbers of people (Fidler et al., 2007) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, quarantine was widely used in several Asian countries and Canada, and it played a role in ending the epidemic. Similarly, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, social distancing measures, including quarantine, had become a major containment strategy. The paradox of quarantine and other social distancing measures is that they may effectively resist the outbreak of disease, but the scope of application is too wide, leading to various social hazards, including economic disruption, physical isolation and even violence. Quarantine is the first public health tool to control infectious diseases and remains a legitimate and valuable public health strategy because it has a significant impact on civil liberties, economic activity and social cohesion, so officials must be extra careful about the possibility of abusing quarantine authority (Rothstein, 2015) .",26.570988082442234,10.676534768187743

While it is impractical to test every US resident for SARS-CoV-2, the virus has been found in the stool of confirmed COVID-19 patients (1), making it a promising candidate for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). WBE can help detect the presence of pathogens across municipalities and estimate population prevalence without individual testing, and inform public health officials of the efficacy of interventions.
