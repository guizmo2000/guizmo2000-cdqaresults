DSLP supports several ongoing surveillance platforms for enteric and respiratory disease, acute febrile illness (AFI) and jaundice. Disease burden and intervention effectiveness cannot be easily translated from one setting to another, especially when the epidemiology, circulating strains or co-morbidities and other ecologic considerations are dissimilar. To introduce and sustain prevention programs such as vaccination, policy-makers need evidence of disease burden and impact of the intervention among other factors. DLSP has contributed to national and global burden estimates for a range of pathogens, most notably enteric and respiratory pathogens [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] These estimates have led to the introduction of vaccines against rotavirus (in 2014) and pneumococcus (in 2011) in Kenya. Diagnostic testing is key in these studies-an example is rotavirus vaccine efficacy which varies significantly between high and low income settings [11] may be due to the different genotypes circulating than those targeted in the vaccines, poor nutrition or environmental enteropathy or other factors such as competition with co-existing enteric pathogens [12] .",34.22261601204941,15.867698140247109

(Fig. 2) . DLSP has been a leader in the development, validation and field evaluation of TAC technology capable of detecting > 25 pathogens from a single specimen from cases of common syndromes AFI, respiratory disease, enteric disease, encephalitis). TAC is a microfluidic PCR array platform that allows the customization of pathogen targets according to the needs of each study. Four main TACs were developed, evaluated and/or validated by DLSP (AFI, Enteric, Encephalitic and Respiratory). The AFI TAC has been validated in Kenya and other GDD centers and used throughout the GDD network of laboratories [30] . This TAC targets 25 pathogens (14 viral, 8 bacterial and 3 protozoa) with an overall sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 99% compared to conventional RT-PCR [30] . The Enteric TAC was similarly validated for 15 of the most common enteropathogens detected in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) using 1500 clinical specimens [31, 32] . The Encephalitis TAC was developed to detect 21 pathogens (2 parasites, 6 bacteria, 13 viruses) known to cause encephalitis, with an overall sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 97% across tested comparative assays [33] . Because TAC is an effective screening tool for multiple pathogens in a single sample, it can detect co-infections or discover emerging pathogens not routinely tested through national surveillance platforms that frequently have a narrow focus. As part of the DLSP collaboration, DGHP has recently acquired next generation sequencing (NGS) technology in KEMRI laboratories. NGS technology has expanded beyond the 1970s Sanger technology and 1988 capillary electrophoresis based sequencing instruments allowing for high throughput to produce 1.8 terabases in a single run which is approximately 1000-fold increase from the first generation sequencing technology. NGS is also capable of identifying new and multiple pathogens from single specimens [34] as well as further characterizing existing pathogens for phylogenetic analysis using metagenomics to detect microbiomes from different specimens (e.g., stool, blood, skin) [35] . The main advantage of whole genome (WG)-NGS is that there is no need to design primers by pathogen target and the laborious process of testing primers for specificity and assessment of their interference with other targets and will likely replace PCR technology as routine diagnostic test. WG-NGS has successfully identified a new rickettsial species, Candidatus Rickettsia asembonensis strain NMRCiiT [36] . Sequencing studies for use in characterizing the spread of influenza viruses, cholera, and vector-borne pathogens such as chikungunya, dengue and Zika viruses are in progress.

Routine surveillance has continuously evolved since 2010, expanding in scale and scope with more sites reporting on more conditions every year since. The ability to add diseases and conditions to the system before and during outbreaks, and if necessary set up enhanced complementary components such as cholera surveillance exemplifies the system's adaptability, scalability, and flexibility. The planned integration of community-based surveillance will improve detection of health threats in rural communities where health-care utilization is very low. 20 In line with CDC and WHO guidelines on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response, the system should be integrated to coordinate and streamline the portfolio of existing surveillance activities and to maximize efficiency and resources, rather than trying to maintain separate vertical activities. 21 The experience of establishing a surveillance system of national scope in Haiti utilizing existing surveillance infrastructure highlights the fact that it is more efficient to integrate existing disease surveillance data flows into a matrix-like structure where vertical (or in-depth) surveillance systems capture the information necessary to meet the surveillance data needs of a horizontal (or broad) system. Cholera surveillance provides a working example of a vertically designed module capable of being integrated into the horizontal routine system. Such an integrated and centralized platform of surveillance is a step in helping Haiti to conform to the 2005 IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. 22, 23 Through a resolution in 2008, WHO emphasized the role of public health laboratories by calling for the organization of a national public health laboratory that would link national, regional, subregional, and international laboratories. 24 Internationally, the national laboratory has already developed partnerships with the relevant regional laboratory (Caribbean Public Health Agency) and reference laboratories (e.g., CDC-Atlanta). Within the country, the national laboratory is working on implementing in-country regional laboratories that will greatly improve the laboratory component of the surveillance system and ensure that laboratory results are linked in surveillance system with cases. Integrating laboratory confirmation into routine surveillance and its complementary systems is essential to minimize delays in taking public health action. 20 The laboratory-enhanced surveillance system represents a significant step in the long-term transition toward laboratory-based surveillance and a model for how the laboratory testing can be best integrated into routine surveillance STRENGTHENING NATIONAL DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE activities as capacity in this field continues to grow. However, much work remains to be done along this axis. As one example of an area for future improvement, the ongoing implementation of electronic laboratory information management systems will allow testing results to be linked with case data in real time. Furthermore, laboratory diagnostic capacity at the level of health facilities across the country needs to continue to be improved in parallel to the strengthening of regional reference laboratories. To achieve this, in parallel to building diagnostic capacity at this level, sites should be encouraged to routinely send samples to the national laboratory as a part of their quality assurance program.",34.48825449260757,14.27340770244042

Federal agencies should digitally connect and automate the comparisons of data from the food, animal, and human health surveillance programs that are operated by CDC, FDA, and USDA, which may provide an earlier indication of a link between human and animal infections. At the very least, there should be a way to directly compare isolated patterns that are in animal and human health surveillance programs.

Phage-based vaccines not only serve as preventative platforms for battle with microbial and parasitic infections, but also can find utility as therapeutic platforms for combat against non-infectious diseases. The therapeutic application of phage-based vaccines is achieved through immunotherapy that is based on harnessing the innate power of body's natural defense to fight the disease. In this manner, phage-inspired vaccines can be directed towards treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, drug addiction, etc. A body of convincing evidence reinforces the notion that phages are able to interact with and release their cargo inside mammalian cells, thus being suggested as a novel gene/drug delivery vehicle. However, as phages are specific antagonists to prokaryotic hosts, their natural capacity for eukaryotic cargo delivery remains largely limited. The surface engineering of phages through phage display can dramatically improve the efficacy of these viral particles for the delivery of prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic cargoes into eukaryotic hosts.

Enhanced surveillance measures with an emphasis on innovation, transparency and incorporation of the One Health model are critical to epidemic preparedness measures in the future. It is also crucial to encourage research during outbreaks through rapid data sharing to facilitate rapid response efforts, as is promoted through organisations such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) [9] . Vaccination, if it can be implemented in time, can also bend the epidemic curve. Promoting platforms for rapid vaccine development and deployment could provide a significant boost to outbreak control. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a public-private coalition that has been working to halt epidemics through the development of appropriate vaccines, is promoting both pathogenspecific and agnostic platform approaches [10] . These efforts deserve wide support and encouragement. In order for vaccines to be effectively employed, the growing threat of vaccine hesitancy worldwide must also be countered using methods grounded in the social sciences. Governments, through their public health agencies and in coordination with efforts like the Global Health Security Agenda, must adopt preparedness plans and exercise them before outbreaks become major threats [11] .

Several commercial reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and serological diagnostic assays for CCHFV are already available, including febrile agent panels to distinguish CCHFV from other viral haemorrhagic fever agents; however, the majority of international laboratories use inhouse assays. As CCHFV has numerous amplifying animal hosts, a crosssectoral 'One Health' approach to outbreak prevention is recommended to enhance notifications and enable early warning for genetic and epidemiological shifts in the human, animal and tick populations. However, a lack of guidance for surveillance in animals, harmonisation of case identification and validated serodiagnostic kits for animal testing hinders efforts to strengthen surveillance systems. Additionally, as RT-PCR tests tend to be lineagespecific for regional circulating strains, there is a need for pan-lineage sensitive diagnostics. Adaptation of existing tests to point-of-care molecular diagnostic platforms that can be implemented in clinic or field-based settings would be of value given the potential for CCHFV outbreaks in remote or low-resource areas.

Seroconversion in animals is a good indicator of CCHFV prevalence; when domestic animals in Turkey and Bulgaria were tested for CCHFV-specific IgG antibodies, the mean seroprevalence was 26% for Bulgaria and 57% for Turkey, with some provinces reporting seroprevalence of almost 90%. 94 In both rural and urban settings, similar 'random sampling' surveillance programmes have been employed for ticks 85 95-97 and other ruminants. 98 99 However, routine reservoir/host monitoring is not broadly implemented, and surveillance is challenged by a lack of serodiagnostic tests suitable for large-scale animal testing, 100 no clear guidance for standardised surveillance of CCHFV in the animal health sector, and the cost of routine implementation. 6 For human surveillance, high prevalence endemic countries (Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Turkey) report human cases annually through health surveillance systems, although not uniformly effective. 101 Other countries (Afghanistan, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) have occasional human cases reported; these and surrounding non-endemic countries would benefit from active surveillance systems for early identification of hot spots. 102 Harmonisation of case definition For CCHF surveillance, harmonisation of case identification is necessary to enhance notifications and estimate disease burden, as well as to enable early warning for genetic and epidemiological shifts in the human, animal and tick populations. 6 59 95 103 National CCHF prevention and control programmes should be strengthened and supported by the respective Ministries of Health and international agencies. 6 63 102 To assist these goals, a guideline development group for CCHF has been established by WHO to formulate recommendations, evaluate optimal implementation and develop guidelines on clinical management, 104 as well as ongoing efforts towards the WHO Roadmap to prioritise research and product development for CCHF. 105 Clinical validation During the early stage of an outbreak, diagnostic tests are often evaluated using the strains most relevant to that region. Diagnostic test development could be accelerated through validation and external quality control (EQA) using up-to-date clinical specimen panels and reference standards, particularly since prior EQA performance indicated a wide range in laboratory test sensitivity. While the majority of laboratories received high marks, the observed sensitivities ranged from 75% to 100% for serological assays and from 43% to 100% for molecular assays (with outliers as low as 25% for older test methods). 53 65 Specifically, routine EQA studies should include a range of CCHFV genotypes and concentrations to accurately evaluate and compare diagnostic performance. To the extent possible, patient specimens could be characterised and maintained for diagnostic test evaluation and quality assurance. In the absence of clinical specimens, a recombinant approach may be needed to generate sufficient quantities of quality control material. 106 107 For CCHF diagnostic test developers, sourcing clinical specimens has been a major roadblock to both molecular and serological assay validation. 8 The manufacturing process requires a substantial amount of reference material, and often companies develop inhouse calibration standards to control supply and lot-to-lot variability. There is little incentive to seek international regulatory approval; even for commercial suppliers, the investment for regulatory approval is often subject to market demand. Some international reference institutes, including the WHO International Biological Reference custodian laboratories, provide reference materials or specimen panels for validation or EQA/proficiency (online supplementary list S1). A specimen bank would be beneficial to CCHFV diagnostic development; however, this effort faces significant challenges given the sporadic nature of human cases which typically occur in remote agricultural BMJ Global Health regions across 30 countries, with only several hundred cases confirmed each year. 6 Turnaround time and PoC testing As RT-PCR testing requires a high infrastructure laboratory and a turnaround time of 2-5 days, a more flexible approach is needed for an outbreak, with options that serve both animal and human populations. POC and 'near-POC' molecular diagnostic platforms have significantly lower infrastructure requirements and have been implemented in decentralised laboratories. [108] [109] [110] These POC instruments are compact and self-contained, with automated sample preparation, and most healthcare workers can be trained for operation in clinic or fieldbased settings. Given the range of assays already developed for these commercial platforms, it is likely that current CCHFV RT-PCR assays could be readily adapted to the POC cartridge-based format.",22.424046355820373,12.124117663917776

By tiering, preferential discounts or even royalty-free access to research inputs is provided, often bounded by field of use or geography.

It is true in retrospect that existing digital systems and their associated early warnings could have been faster if their first signals had been correctly named or interpreted at an early stage. At the same time, however, it is mostly ignored that even official state authorities often have knowledge about specific events at relatively early stagesonly that they either initially withhold such information or distribute it in other ways according to the official information/notification systems, e.g. the example of Stephen, the authorities of Guinea were aware that there was something going on, but they waited with the reporting. So have I experienced it at the WHO: few countries directly provided all available information to the organization. It can also be observed again and again that official information either minimizes or plays to the media or other entities in a targeted way. In this context, non-state surveillance platforms such as ProMED or HealthMap, for example, should be commended especially for their dimension of political transparency, as they put pressure on governments not to keep information from the public as much as possible. At the same time, however, the increasingly digitized identification, analysis and distribution of epidemiological indications of infectious disease these platforms enable not only leads to increasing likelihood of false positives, but also to specific problems of an immediate, uncontrollable communication of risk.

We found few gaps in implementation in direct relation to the IHR (2005) core capacities. Nonetheless, additional research could be useful in evaluating countries' core capacity performance against actual disease epidemics. Specifically, we did not identify any documentation evaluating IHR (2005) core capacity development with national performance in preventing, detecting and responding to disease epidemics. This type of evaluation could provide useful data for future revisions of the IHR. Moreover, defining fundamental data needs for new treatments and vaccines could help develop national research Countries had different national health plans outlining how to organize their systems and strategies for managing threats and hazards. 78 National plans typically outlined how health priorities will be managed and linked to programmespecific strategic plans, such as those for primary health care, maternal and child health, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).

The success of private veterinarians is dependent upon their relationship with producers: it is imperative that surveillance initiatives reliant on the participation of private veterinarians respect this relationship and not serve to undermine it. For example, pre-diagnostic surveillance initiatives may need to include mechanisms that ensure specific farm locations are excluded from case submissions in order to protect the privacy of producers and gain support from veterinarians, as was done with the AVSN-VPS (John Berezowski, personal communication). In addition, the goals of surveillance initiatives need to be communicated to producers so that when changes are made that are deemed necessary producers understand the reasons behind them.

Besides solely increasing immunogenicity, adjuvants can play an important role in facilitating increased speed of vaccine availability, because less viral antigen is required per dose (dose-sparing) meaning that more doses can become available in short period of time. In addition, adjuvants may help achieve the other aim of universal influenza vaccines; increasing the breadth of the immune response. It has been noted that oil-in-water adjuvants raise the quantity of cross-reactive antibodies [148] , however this may merely be a reflection of the overall increase in the humoral response that also increases previously unnoticed broadly reactive antibodies to a level above their detection thresholds.",21.918591508439206,12.770960679858781

Many countries however detect RSV infections within existing surveillance systems for influenza [12] [13] . Moreover, one of the challenges to implement a global RSV surveillance system is the lack of a uniform case definition.

There are several advantages of using (attenuated or replication deficient) viral vectors as vaccine platforms for universal vaccines. As previously mentioned, cellular immune responses appear to play a pivotal role in protection from influenza infection, especially when a broad (heterosubtypic) immunity is desired. Subunit proteins, and whole or split inactivated viruses, often induce antibody and CD4 + T-cell responses due to exclusive antigen presentation by MHC class II. The advantage of using viral vectors is that they drive de novo synthesis of proteins in infected cells and facilitate endogenous antigen processing and presentation by both MHC class I and II molecules, thus inducing the complete spectrum of cellular and humoral immune responses. Additionally, they may stimulate mucosal immunity (depending on the route of administration) and thus function much like the existing LAIV vaccines, but without many of the safety or production issues. Viral vectors may actually be able to act as their own adjuvants as the immune system can mount a response to both the protein of interest and the vector. Consequently, these vaccines even have the potential to be used as bivalent vaccines, inducing immunity against the vector itself or its origin and the transgenic influenza virus protein(s). Conversely, this may require that the host is immunologically naive for the vector, as pre-existing immunity to the vector could potentially interfere with induction of immunity against the foreign protein of interest. Other concerns with some of the vectors, for example the use Newcastle disease virus, include the possibility of recombination and reversion to virulence in chickens [107] .",18.899533917441712,10.20505001493013

Starting condition factors reported to enable collaboration at the network level included network structures, existing relationships, available resources in the face of a health event, and the political environment in place to support these efforts. Pre-existing network structures were reported to provide a foundation for effective collaborative efforts to occur across participating organizations. Established Multisectoral Coordinating Mechanisms (MCMs), also referred to as One Health platforms or joint task forces, were often reported as key to assisting with collaboration across a network [34, 41, 42, 45, 48, 52, 60, 72] . Organizational and network structures provided operational standards that crossed relational and organizational boundaries at all levels of the system-individual, organizational and network-which supported the development of formal relationships at each level. Analysis suggested that these systems and relationships need to be in place before the health event. MCMs provide a formalized operating foundation in which organizations and individuals could contribute, and formalized roles and responsibilities supported effective human resource mobilization in both organizations and networks [34, 42, 45, 72] . These structures were often supported by formal policies or agreements such as bilateral agreements or Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) [41, 45, 72] . In addition, operating procedures such as the Incident Command System (ICS) also supported effective mobilization of multiple organizations within the MCM [60] . Finally, the importance of formal structures were repeatedly emphasized as a response to ""lessons learned"" during challenging responses. On the contrary, lack of existing structures was reported to prevent efficient multisectoral engagement in the preparedness and response to health events [37, 42, 71] . Several sources indicated that reporting structures and policies at local, regional, national and international levels support continuity of response and effective implementation in response to health events [45, 48, 49, 58, 60, 62, 65, 72, 73] . These reporting structures and policies allowed for information flow between stakeholders, and the coordination of response efforts across a diversity of individuals and organizations participating in preparedness or response efforts [31, 49, 58, 65, 74] .",25.027544193996363,12.044971931712508

Poor reporting is a major constraint to the surveillance of both emerging and endemic zoonoses, and several important barriers to reporting can be identified: (i) a lack of tangible benefits when reports are made; (ii) a lack of capacity to enforce regulations; (iii) poor communication among communities, institutions and sectors; and (iv) complexities of the international regulatory environment. Redirecting surveillance efforts to focus on endemic zoonoses in developing countries offers a pragmatic approach that overcomes some of these barriers and provides support in regions where surveillance capacity is currently weakest.

An efficient and scalable emergency response system that can respond to surge capacity-Pandemic preparedness relies on a system that can surge in times of crisis. Surge capacity has four key components: equipment, physical space, human resources, and system [24] . In pandemics, the duration, scope, and magnitude of the response required are uncertain. In most countries, health care systems operate at or above maximally designed capacity. Many hospitals just do not have sufficient pre-existing resources to respond to surge capacity in an outbreak [25] . Unlike with natural disasters, where the greatest need for resources often occurs early in the time course, pandemic resource requirements will build over months. Outbreaks that become pandemics generally do not take hold in multiple locations at exactly the same time-they are geographically and temporally patchy. Still enough must be immediately available to allow time for other regions and/or manufacturers to meet the increased demand.",22.621113741087154,10.057457094679805

More generally, the challenge of properly differentiating primary from secondary infections is of fundamental importance for analysis of stuttering zoonoses. Even when well-trained surveillance teams are on site to assess transmission pathways, it may be impossible for them to decide between two equally likely infection sources. For instance, it can be difficult to decide if a mother contracted monkeypox because she cared for an infected child or because she contacted infected meat (in the same contact event as the child, or a later one). The theory presented here forms a foundation for further research on infection source assignment and its relationship to underlying transmission mechanisms. Future investigations can leverage existing methods of source assignment developed for supercritical diseases, which utilize various epidemiological data such as symptom onset time, risk factor identification and pathogen genetic sequence data [32] [33] [34] . These types of theoretical developments, combined with strong collaborative ties between field epidemiologists and modelers, would likely expand the use of existing epidemiological data and improve resource allocation for future surveillance efforts.",21.493679167629697,11.002728456885116

Our results indicate that both asthmatic and non-asthmatic RV-C-infected children displayed an increase in Th2-and pro-inflammation-associated cytokines. IL-4 and IL-9 were Th2 cytokines that were elevated in both groups of RV-C-infected children. However, the levels of these cytokines were higher in children with pre-existing asthma than in non-asthmatic children. Therefore, these Th2 cytokines can be considered as signature responses to RV-C infection in children presenting to hospital with wheeze. Both IL-4 and IL-9 are known to shape the immune response in allergic asthma. Previous studies have demonstrated that Th2 cytokine IL-4 mediates recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung, IgE isotype class switching, upregulation of high affinity IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils, and IgE-dependent mast cell activation, which together result in the development of immediate allergic reactions and mucus hypersecretion [22, 23] . IL-9 can elicit detrimental effects on epithelial integrity and ciliated cell differentiation leading to mucus hypersecretion as well as impaired mucus clearance [24] . It is also likely that the intrinsic immunologic predisposition of children with asthma amplifies an existing Th2 pulmonary environment [25] , which may explain why the levels of Th2 cytokines were higher and broader ( Figure 2) in RV-C-infected children with pre-existing asthma.

Baseline shifts like these might prevent the detection of increased illness caused by the epidemic or the bioterrorist attack. Localized population surges associated with major public events (for example, the Olympics) are also likely to reduce the ability of existing surveillance systems to detect infectious disease outbreaks. In this study, the researchers developed a new class of surveillance systems called ''epidemiological network models.''

Reported cases based on positive test results are often only the top of the surveillance pyramid ( Figure 1 ). The degradation of information through the surveillance hierarchy remains a challenge, with detailed records that are somewhat unstructured at the individual physician level and highly structured surveillance records with limited data fields, less detail and, for some countries with a poor ability to examine the original records at national and, thus, at EU level. Surveillance data need to be timely and distributed to those who need it for the early detection and control of outbreaks, for measuring the impact of interventions, or for undertaking research. Surveillance may be compulsory or voluntary, active or passive, case-based or aggregated (although aggregated data is usually less useful).

In the current commentary, we have elaborated on the argument made by Karamouzian et al that a key measure for preventing a concentrated epidemic from becoming a disseminated one is to intensively and consistently collect population-based data. 2 Although recognition and characterization of a problem is the first step toward its resolution, it is meaningless if that knowledge does not translate into action. Action starts with active surveillance efforts and meaningful investments into regional networks and national programs, such as those that have been outlined in the course of this commentary.

Lastly, the SAGES tools are built in a modular nature, which allows for the user to select one or more tools to enhance an existing surveillance system or use the tools en masse for an end-to-end electronic disease surveillance capability. Thus, each locality can select tools from SAGES based upon their needs, capabilities, and existing systems to create a customized electronic disease surveillance system.",35.17576283660515,15.920110289816503

One respondent reflected, 'We did something, but of course not very well, because most of the activities we had embarked on were affected by the lack of critical infrastructure' (P8). Another respondent, a lay person who was involved in implementation, argued that preparedness required the use of the available infrastructure, such as existing surveillance systems and laboratories. However, in Malawi, key infrastructure was severely limited, hence the use of diagnostic laboratories in Kenya. Establishing new infrastructure such as laboratories during emergency situations is practically impossible, given that this would take several years. For most respondents, the only way to achieve responses that mirrored preparedness plans was to improve health services generally, but essential services to facilitate rapid diagnostic, care and monitoring of disease spread all needed strengthening. A few respondents identified existing infrastructures, such as the Health Management Information System (HMIS), an information technology system that could have been deployed and adapted to provide timely information on influenza outbreaks. Respondents across the interviews were aware that having a functional information technology system would ensure the easy flow of information about the pandemic outbreaks, specifically to inform public health policy about, for example, whether additional staff were needed.

The WHO recommends reinforcement of routine surveillance capacity both from an epidemiological and virological standpoint to monitor influenza. This requires collection of sickness reports combined with laboratory and clinical investigations as valuable indicators of the occurrence of influenza. It is essential to monitor for influenza-like illnesses (ILI), including severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) during influenza season and non-season periods. Unless these ILI and SARI are characterised and monitored, policymakers will not be well informed on the burden of respiratory diseases in order to prioritise resources and plan public health interventions to mitigate influenza infections.

Because of these challenges, the overarching goal is to optimize control interventions for the least amount of effort and expense. It is therefore important to gain as much quantitative information about disease transmission as possible from existing surveillance data.

The ratio of IAR to pre-existing seroprevalence (the signal-tobackground ratio), which decreased with age for pdmH1N1 in 2009, was a major determinant of the timeliness of reliable estimates. The 2009 pandemic provided a particular challenge from the point of view of serologic interpretation because it was caused by a virus subtype that was previously endemic in humans. This led to the presence of serologic cross-reactivity and therefore significant pre-existing seroprevalence at MN titer $1:40, especially in the older age groups, hence the lack of timeliness of reliable IHP estimates in our retrospective analysis. This would have been much less of a problem with the pandemics of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) or a future pandemic of H5N1. With H9N2 viruses, the challenge posed by serologic cross-reactions may be comparable to that with pdmH1N1 because a proportion of individuals born before 1968 appear to have cross-reactive antibodies [22] . Our results suggest that for serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance to yield timely and accurate estimates of IAR and severity, pre-existing seroprevalence needs be adjusted to near zero by choosing a sufficiently high titer cutoff for seropositivity. Given our limited serologic testing capacity, we only screened our specimens at MN titers of $ the exact antibody titer for each specimen. The performance of serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance might be enhanced if exact titers were available and incorporated into the real-time estimation of IHP. If hemagglutination inhibition rather than the more labor intensive MN tests were used (which may be feasible with some pandemic viruses), the logistical feasibility and performance of sero-surveillance may be further enhanced, although for pdmH1N1 the MN test was more sensitive and specific to confirmed infection [23] . Automation of serologic assays may increase feasibility of large-scale serology in the future. The 2009 influenza pandemic highlighted the need for improved methods of rapid, reliable assessment of transmissibility and severity for an unfolding infectious disease outbreak. The Fineberg et al. [24] report on the performance of WHO during the pandemic highlighted the lack of ''a consistent, measurable and understandable depiction of severity'' as one of the shortcomings of the response in 2009, and called for proper timely assessment of severity to guide public health response. Real-time transmission modeling methods have previously been devised to estimate IAR and severity based on clinical surveillance data without the use of serologic data [25, 26] . Their performance depends on the reliability of the underlying transmission model, e.g., assumptions and data regarding contact patterns between age groups, medical consultation rates, and pre-existing immunity. In this study, we showed that serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance could complement these methods to allow timely and accurate real-time estimates of IAR and severity.",18.72761286767956,8.948634164685236

Important factors include the size of the genome being considered, its complexity including G+C content, as well as the depth of coverage and accuracy required. It is therefore most important to take advice from local service providers. That said, some general principles based on current technology performance may help to guide the decision-making process. For those looking to assemble complex genomes de novo, longer read lengths may be appropriate. For those seeking faster turnaround times, then the smaller platforms may offer greater flexibility, depending on the size of the laboratory (Loman et al., 2012) . 454 sequencing (Roche), whilst currently relatively expensive, still has a niche in amplicon sequencing because of its longer reads. Other platforms may be more appropriate for direct RNA sequencing (Helicos) and very long reads (PacBio). However, as both are single-molecule sequencers, accuracy may become an important issue depending on the experiment.

Roche 454 Life Sciences (Branford, CT, USA) developed NGS platforms based on pyrosequencing, a high-throughput sequencing-by-synthesis bioluminescence method that monitors real-time release of pyrophosphate following incorporation of dNTPs into a growing strand of nascent DNA. This sequencing platform has been evaluated as a diagnostic tool in influenza research by several groups, primarily for identification of molecular markers of drug resistance among circulating influenza A viruses. Bright and colleagues were the first to use this platform to study the incidence of adamantine resistance among seasonal influenza A viruses from subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2, isolated worldwide from 1994-2005 [64] . During a decade of surveillance, a significant increase in drug resistance, from 0.4% in 1994-1995 to 12.3% was observed in 2003-2004. This study highlighted the clinical importance of rapid surveillance for antiviral resistance among circulating seasonal influenza virus strains. Since then, several groups have successfully used the pyrosequencing platform to identify mutations in genes coding for M2 and NA responsible for resistance to adamantanes, amantadine and rimantadine and oseltamavir, respectively, among seasonal and highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses. Pyrosequencing has also been used by a few groups to identify SNPs in the gene coding for hemagglutinin. Levine et al. used a customized pyrosequencing protocol for the detection of pH1N1 virus variants at amino acid position 222 of hemagglutinin, known to be associated with enhanced virulence in humans [65] . More recently, Lee et al. used pyrosequencing to identify G186D and R292K mutations in genes coding for HA and NA in an immunocompromised child infected with influenza A/H3N2 virus being treated with oseltamivir [66] . [70] . They showed that use of ViroChip microarray allowed the correct detection of influenza pH1N1 without a priori information, while the NGS deep sequencing technique provided in-depth knowledge into the upper respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to virus infection. Whitehead et al. utilized Illumina NGS platform to obtain comprehensive sequence-function map through deep sequencing, and optimized influenza-binding proteins based on the NGS data [71] .

New platforms, such as viral vector and nucleic acid based vaccines meet the prerequisites to provide solutions for some of these challenges by representing highly versatile technologies that allow fast vaccine manufacturing. Each vaccine technology has its own advantages and disadvantages related to its ability to induce certain immune responses, manufacturing capacity and safety for human use ( Table 4 ). Viral vector based vaccines are able to induce potent immune responses against the encoded target antigen. Indeed, a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that viral vector based vaccines such as VSV-ZEBOV show great promise for inducing protective responses in humans. However, antigen delivery in the context of an unrelated virus renders this technology relatively complex in terms of manufacturing. Furthermore, the presence of immune targets other than the target antigen can lead to unfavorable effects such as pre-existing immunity hampering immune responses, as seen for Ad5 vectors, or the inability to use the same technology for repeated vaccinations. In addition, delivery of Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org attenuated viral vectors raises safety concerns due to the risk of adverse events and residual viral replication upon delivery, as detected in a small number of subjects in a clinical trial testing VSV-ZEBOV.

Although metrics such as cost per run, cost per base, error rate and throughput are important when evaluating performance, the read length and number of reads per run are perhaps most useful when judging sequencing capacity (Levy and Myers 2016) . Since 2012, an annual comparison of available sequencing platforms (based on these two factors) has been presented by Lex Nederbragt at the University of Oslo, with data from July 2016 illustrated in Fig. 2b (Nederbragt 2016) . Currently, Illumina's Hiseq platforms lead the field in terms of throughput and unsurprisingly dominate the sequencer market share. That said, most mainstream NGS systems make use of short-read lengths, which yields limitations in the resolution of structural mutations and ability to perform de novo sequencing (Treangen and Salzberg 2012) . Accordingly, NGS technologies capable of long reads (such as those provided by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore) are becomingly increasingly important, although still in the early stages of development. Finally, it should be noted that extended read lengths can be accessed indirectly via synthetic long-read (SLR) sequencing methods, which leverage short-read sequencing data to generate synthetic long reads via partitioning, label indexing and remapping techniques (Kuleshov et al. 2014) .

Vital to reducing the spread and impact of zoonotic pathogens to humans and among animal populations is early detection and isolation, which first requires observations of the affected animal hosts either when they are sick or dead. Because the transmission route for zoonotic pathogens from animal host to humans is inherently complex, evidence can be presented to advocate for both active and passive animal surveillance (Olson et al. 2012) . We suggest that, in part because of this complexity, both should co-occur in comprehensive surveillance programs for disease prevention in humans and wildlife. We have shown that 75 zoonotic pathogens are known to cause extended morbidity or mortality in their animal hosts, and we argue that the quick reporting of these sick or dead animals could have prevented the subsequent or concurrent emergence in humans. Active animal surveillance programs, although essential, are often costly and must be operated by extensively trained personnel thus limiting the scope of surveillance efforts. Passive animal reporting monitoring, on the other hand is a monitoring system that can employ low-cost technology available to civil servants (e.g., park rangers) and the public (e.g., hunters, farmers, citizens) of all income levels, greatly expanding the geographic range of surveillance efforts. If zoonotic disease surveillance and monitoring were limited to the sampling of live animals, it would greatly limit the scope of the search to a small proportion of the public trained for such sampling. We therefore propose that integrating an animal morbidity and mortality surveillance program is fundamental for the success of public health surveillance systems. Pilot tests can easily be included in public health platforms initially in one to two zoonotic disease hotspots by merging public health surveillance systems with wildlife management efforts. Peri-urban regions near wildlife conservation areas would be ideal interfaces for such pilot tests and disease hotspots would provide a more opportunistic environment to evaluate the effectiveness of reporting sick or dead animals for pathogen detections. Recent use of mobile phone technology has proven highly successful in the public health sector (e.g., 'Outbreaks Near Me' application, [29] [30] [31] FrontlineSMS, 32; EpiSurveyor, 33) . It also offers a similar utility for animal morbidity and mortality monitoring because it can easily be integrated in citizen science approaches that encourage people to report animal mortality events as well as prioritization of reporting in high-risk pathogen transmission zones, such as conservation areas and regions where agriculture and wildlife overlap. We propose that mobile-based data collection could facilitate and rapidly mobilize surveillance teams for pathogen sampling by linking reporting by the public and civil servants to alerting mechanisms with local authorities. Once local authorities are alerted, dead animals can be sampled for the presence of pathogens and surveillance efforts can be initiated if animals have tested positively for zoonotic pathogens, thus focusing surveillance on target animals, pathogens, or areas. The challenges inherent in any system requiring large-scale surveillance of potentially small targets are both in the survey and reporting. For animal morbidity or mortality surveillance, reports may be biased toward larger animals-not only because they are more visible but because carcasses may persist for a longer period of time (Santos et al. 2011 )-, animals that are found near or in human habitations, or domestic animals (Table 1 ) because of their proximity to humans and financial value.",23.134538791447632,12.80178635284743

Also, the technical complexity and required throughput are important variables that may influence the approach chosen for this application. Current stool test algorithms using conventional methods typically require clinicians to consider which pathogens might be associated with the disease and choose among a variety of tests to ensure that all pathogens are covered. It is not surprising that this piecemeal approach often fails to yield positive results. The use of comprehensive pathogen panels dramatically increases diagnostic yield, but with this comes the unique challenge of interpreting the results from patients with multiple pathogens detected. In the FDA clinical trial of the FilmArray GI Panel, at least one potential pathogen was detected in 53.5% of specimens, and among these, multiple potential pathogens were detected in 32.9%. 244 Asymptomatic infections with C. difficile, Cryptosporidium spp., and G. lamblia are not uncommon, and some of the other IGE pathogens such as Salmonella spp. and norovirus can be shed for weeks after resolution of symptoms.

LABVs possess the capacity to induce humoral as well as cell-mediated immune response. While the humoral immune response includes serum IgG and mucosal IgG and IgA, the cell-mediated immunity is characterized by Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-type CD4+ T cells and CD8+ CTLs. IgA and IL17 have been specifically implicated in mucosal protection against various mucosal pathogens. The cell-mediated immunity is required for intracellular pathogens. It should be noted that subunit vaccines have a poor capacity to evoke mucosal as well as cell-mediated immunity. LABVs have also shown the capacity to overcome immunosuppressive nature of various forms of tumors. These characteristic of LABVs, together with their tumor-tropic capacity, makes them a highly suitable vector for cancer immunotherapeutic vaccines. In the past two decades, tremendous progress has been made regarding LABV-mediated delivery of vaccine antigens for prevention of a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases. Recent advances have further improved the safety and immunogenicity profile of several LABV platforms. The new-generation LABVs can withstand harsh physicochemical conditions of gastrointestinal tract, exhibit regulated attenuation, regulated antigen expression, and targeted antigen delivery. LABVs have exhibited effectiveness in various preclinical and preliminary clinical trials (Table 2 .1). However, a limited number of clinical trials have been conducted to date using LABVs, due to potential safety concerns. Further optimization would result in a versatile, safe, and highly immunogenic vaccine delivery platforms. Ding et al. (2013) ",19.658421241254945,11.022725664629508

Although there are many dimensions to improvement of health statistics, I concentrate on three issues that are central to fostering good practice in the use of health statistics: focusing on priority indicators; correct use of crude, corrected, or predicted statistics; and the need for explicit data audit trails. Taken together, addressing these issues would catalyse better worldwide health statistics practice and stimulate increased national interest in strengthening fundamental data platforms. I believe that increased focus on the production, analysis, and dissemination of priority health indicators will create demand for valid, reliable, and comparable health information, which will stimulate national eff orts to strengthen platforms for primary data collection.

Several experimental vaccine platforms, most of which express the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) as the viral antigen of choice for immunizations, have demonstrated protection in nonhuman primates (NHPs) against lethal EBOV challenge. These vaccine platforms include a DNA prime with a human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) boost [3] , Ad5 alone [4] , virus-like particles [5] , human parainfluenza virus type 3 [6] , rabies virus [7] as well as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [8] . http From the candidates listed above, the live-attenuated VSVbased vaccine (VSV G/EBOVGP) is unique in that it has demonstrated both prophylactic and post-exposure efficacy [8, 9] , suggesting that the vaccine is able to rapidly establish protective immunity in the recipient after immunization. Mucosal vaccination with VSV G/EBOVGP via the intranasal (IN) or oral (OR) routes still protects NHPs [10] , easing the difficulty of administration by eliminating the use of needles. VSV-based vaccines expressing GP from either Marburg virus (MARV) or Sudan virus (SUDV) (known as VSV G/MARVGP or VSV /SUDVGP, respectively) are able to protect against a homologous virus challenge [11, 12] . A blended vaccine consisting of equal parts VSV G/EBOVGP, VSV G/MARVGP and VSV G/SUDVGP conferred complete protection against EBOV, MARV or SUDV challenge [13] . Complete protection was also achieved in these NHPs after challenge with Tai Forest virus (TAFV), suggesting evidence of cross-protection [13] . VSV G/EBOVGP has been previously administered as an emergency treatment to a researcher on compassionate grounds after a suspected EBOV exposure in the laboratory. Aside from a fever detected 12 h after vaccination, the recipient remained healthy [14] . While clinical trials will be needed, this is a positive sign for the safety of VSV-based vaccines. Pre-existing immunity to VSV is not prevalent in humans [15] [16] [17] , and therefore it is not expected to be a significant factor in a potential vaccination campaign with VSV-based vaccines.",18.42754968047,9.238604335128764

As more clinical trials take place, we will gain a better understanding of these vectors and their performance in humans. The second consideration is pre-existing vector immunity, which varies in significance depending on the vector of choice. For Ad or vaccinia vectors, this may have a serious impact on vaccine vector efficacy in humans; for the zoonotic virus vectors, such as avipox viruses or NDV, pre-existing immunity is not likely to play as significant a role in developmental and clinical applications. Finally, the third consideration for vaccine vector development is the vector's genomic capacity for a transgene insert. Depending on the vector, these exogenous DNA sequences can range in length from less than 1 kb to 35 kb. However, with increased transgene size often comes genetic instability and decreased virus yield in production.

However, as the costs drop for MassTag PCR, microarrays and high throughput sequencing, multiplex assays are increasingly used as primary tools for syndromic surveillance, studies of microbial diversity and discovery. Sensitivity can be a challenge with multiplex platforms. In multiplex PCR reactions sensitivity decreases with increasing primer complexity. Microarrays and deep sequencing typically employ unbiased amplification methods wherein host and microbial sequences can compete for polymerase and nucleotides. Improvements in sensitivity can be achieved by using methods that deplete host DNA, ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences through enzymatic digestion or subtractive hybridization prior to unbiased amplification. One can also pursue positive selection using oligonucleotides representing microbes of interest. With high throughput sequencing bioinformatics is frequently the weakest link. The least expensive platforms (e.g. Illumina) typically produce shorter sequence reads that can be difficult to assemble. More expensive platforms (e.g. 454 Life Sciences) typically yield longer but fewer reads; hence, assembly is easier but at a cost of lower coverage.

Whether the virus has been isolated, and more importantly, whether a diagnostic test is available, have implications for surveillance. As a new virus becomes recognized (Fig. 1) , or 'emerges,' it is initially recognized through the clinical presentation of infected individuals. Cases of an apparently novel infectious illness in humans will prompt epidemiological investigations and initiate efforts to isolate the causative agent. Once the agent has been isolated, effort often turns to development of methods for diagnosis. At some point in this progression, the virus is seen as an established cause of endemic or epidemic disease, and is no longer thought of as 'newly emerging. ' The distinction between 'newly emerging' and 'emerging' viruses is therefore important from the perspective of surveillance, because it determines what data a surveillance system can draw upon. For 'newly emerging viruses,' any case definition must rely on clinical and possibly epidemiological data because there are no recognized laboratory tests. Routine surveillance of laboratory test results is likely to be of little use in sounding the initial alarm in an outbreak due to a newly emerging virus. An exception might be if the newly emerging virus is genetically similar to an existing virus, to the extent that it can cross-react in an existing diagnostic test. However, laboratory testing will be useful for ruling out known viruses as the cause of illness, and ultimately to identify the virus. The surveillance system must follow data other than positive laboratory test results, such as reports of abnormal cases, or the incidence of non-specific symptoms, or syndromes that might occur following infection with a newly emerging virus.",28.667133630160947,15.52186726063049

Depending on the combination of clinical presentation of those infected and the genotype of the virus (Fig. 2) , different methods will be more or less efficient for early outbreak detection. Outbreaks of newly emerging viruses characterized by symptoms common to other infections already under surveillance may be detected by an existing surveillance system if the number infected is sufficiently large. Alternatively, infections with a newly emerging virus causing symptoms similar to another, known pathogen may be incorrectly attributed to the known pathogen, thereby obscuring the emerging epidemic. Genetic similarity to a known virus may hasten the identification of a newly emerging virus and the development of a diagnostic test as well as contribute to our understanding of its host range, natural reservoir, and transmission route.

Because syndromic surveillance systems follow data from events that occur before diagnosis, it is assumed that they will detect outbreaks earlier because the incidence of pre-diagnostic events, such as purchase of over-the-counter medications, will increase before the incidence of diagnoses will increase. In general, these assumptions may hold true under some conditions, but not under other conditions. The limited research on these systems suggests that the results are affected by the clinical course of the disease, the number of individuals exposed, the type of data source monitored, whether an applicable routine test is positive in the disease, and the outbreak detection algorithm used (Buehler et al., 2003; Reis et al., 2003; Stoto et al., 2004; Buckeridge et al., 2005b) . Syndromic surveillance is likely to be more rapid than clinical detection in detecting an outbreak when the clinical symptoms mimic an existing disease with a low incidence, when a clinical data source is being monitored, and when there is no routine diagnostic test for the disease. This is a conceivable scenario for the initial presentation of a newly emerging virus, and so it is reasonable to expect that syndromic surveillance systems may be useful in the initial detection of an outbreak due to a newly emerging virus.",21.86688206173965,9.289570662898779

Initially, when the United Nations (UN) development goals were established in 1990, measles was endemic in many countries, and mortality reduction was the primary goal. Given this, aggregate data were the most feasible approach and were conducted in most countries. By 2016, all six WHO regions have measles elimination goals. As measles has moved away from control and toward elimination, case-based surveillance is needed to ensure every case is reported and investigated. When disease was endemic, case-based surveillance would quickly be overwhelmed given the time and resources, but as countries have fewer and fewer cases, it is relatively easier to conduct an investigation on every single case. WHO recommends the type of data to be collected in an investigation. One key advantage of case-based surveillance is that it allows one to analyze which age cohorts are being infected and their individual vaccination status to help to target vaccination efforts and close existing immunity gaps.",21.91827277818468,11.794612912016127

The Virochip was recently used for identifying pathogens in veterinary clinical samples [14, 21] . We had also tested in-house designed chip for testing veterinary clinical samples [35] . Massive multiplexing ability of microarray as compared to other diagnostic techniques is advantageous in identifying multiple infections which may otherwise go unreported. Disadvantage of microarray chip is its high cost which makes its applicability in routine diagnosis highly improbable. Many lowdensity FDA approved microarrays are now commercially available, e.g., xTag Respiratory Viral Panel (Luminex), Filmarray (Biofire), and TessArray RPM-Flu 3.1 Array (TessArae), ResPlex II v2.0 RVP (Qiagen), they are now used regularly in many clinical microbiology labs. The use of high-density microarrays is limited for want of FDA or other regulatory agencies' approval. Their approval by regulatory agencies required testing against all the pathogens; they are capable of identifying, which is technically not feasible. Current cost of using high-density array is high (200-300 USD). The cost is expected to go down substantially as the methodology gets widely adopted. High-cost microarray can still be used as an adjunct diagnostic method for screening of multiple infections, and in those cases where routine diagnostic methods fail to identify a pathogen from clinical sample.

Passive surveillance systems retrospectively gather information about cases from existing records. These systems are often less resource-intensive because of their reliance on pre-existing health infrastructure. However, the reliance on external health providers requires standardisation of methods for collecting data. Before selecting a passive surveillance approach, investigators must consider the quality of existing medical records (which might be scarce, incomplete, or easily lost due to disaster in resource-limited settings), as well as provider willingness to participate, their level of training, and availability to consistently participate in case reporting. 13 Conversely, in active surveillance systems, study personnel identify cases according to pre-set definitions by interacting with potential cases directly. 97 Although active surveillance is more resource-intensive and Review time-intensive, and can be more intrusive, it allows for more complete outcome ascertainment provided the study population is adequately captured. Unless extensive efforts are put in place to standardise passive surveillance, active surveillance also allows for more uniform data collection as study personnel are performing diagnoses. When conducting active surveillance, the frequency of assessment is important to consider. Infrequent followup can miss important events and might be affected by poor recall. For example, a community-based longitudinal study in Lima, Peru, found that visits done twice weekly resulted in lower documented prevalence of clinical symptoms than daily visits, demonstrating that symptom misplacement was more likely to occur as the recall period increased. 98 However, increased frequency of visits can also bias the result by capturing fewer severe cases. In clinical or field trials where surveillance might lead to referrals, early case detection can lead to earlier treatment, thereby reducing the number of severe cases that develop. In the example of the HAPIN trial, whereby severe pneumonia is a primary outcome, active surveillance would possibly reduce the primary outcome. Frequent visits can also be intrusive, leading to decreased compliance with study activities. One must balance these potential sources of bias when deciding frequency of follow-up.",22.427578571327405,12.104380018523095

Today, molecular diagnostic testing has moved toward a more broad syndromic screening approach. This trend is the result of sophisticated technologies that enable the detection of >1 analyte at a time. Tests/devices vary from low multiplex (2-5 analytes) to 25 or more different analytes, often now combining a mixture of pathogen types, (eg, bacteria, viruses, and parasites), and also antibiotic resistance markers. New highly multiplexed cartridge-based systems can detect the majority of bacterial pathogens that cause community, ventilator-associated, and hospital-acquired pneumonia within 1-2 hours. In addition, these systems can detect >20 antibiotic resistance genetic markers. The intent is not to replace culture, as additional characterization of isolates still needs to be performed on cultured samples, but to provide a POC early diagnosis that can lead to more focused appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Other multiplex panels focus on pathogens found in patients with a clinical picture of septic shock or diarrhea caused by a gastrointestinal pathogen. Multiplexed enteric disease panels target common bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Vibrio, and Campylobacter species, and in addition, bacterial toxins (eg, Shiga toxin), parasites (eg, Giardia), and viruses (eg, norovirus). The selection of assay analytes must be clinically relevant; more analytes is not always better and the testing expense may not be reimbursed. At least in the near term, multiplex amplification platforms will replace some activities (viral culture) but will supplement other testing (antibiotic in vitro susceptibility testing). Molecular platforms need to adapt quickly to changing clinical environments. New pathogens are identified (eg, MERS-CoV), variants of old pathogens emerge (eg, influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 and H7N9), and new antibiotic resistance mechanisms evolve (eg, K. pneumoniae carbapenemases and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1). Hence, there is a strong indication for flexibility in test or instrument design. For example, multiplex systems involve complex primer and probe interactions during the initial or subsequent amplification and detection steps. The addition of new primers and probes to detect an additional target will require validation of the newly added target and demonstration that the performance for existing targets is not affected. The revalidation of all existing targets does not need to be undertaken again, and the experimental evidence required demonstrating performance is limited to key points that can be addressed through in-house studies. Furthermore, FDA encourages assay developers to archive specimens used during the clinical evaluation for future use, especially in cases where the multiplex panel is being expanded. These ideas can and have been applied to existing cleared multiplex devices to address detection of emerging and evolving pathogens; however, it is important to note that these mechanisms should not be used to inflate the assay menu of a device to increase marketability, but rather should be used to address true public health needs.",22.37909849958735,12.117332452207716

Furthermore, a feasibility exercise regarding the development of a mobile laboratory suitable for the safe handling of highly infectious pathogens (i.e. covering technical requirements for establishment, biosafety, maintenance, deployment and operation mode in the field, and budget estimation) will represent the stepping stone towards the beginning of virological field activities. Recent publications have shown how the deployment of mobile laboratories in outbreak areas may serve the dual purpose of diagnosing infected individuals early, therefore facilitating the implementation of effective isolation of cases, and improving the available diagnostic tests through validation against human sera collected locally [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . The purpose of a European mobile BSL-4 laboratory (which, for all technical and biosafety aspects, is also suitable for BSL-3 agents) would be to perform diagnostics within Europe or in other countries where these agents are endemic or outbreaks occur. It would not only increase European preparedness by overcoming specific geographical weaknesses represented by countries for which BSL-4 laboratories are probably too costly to build, operate and maintain, but also, and above all, it would represent an invaluable support and back-up during scaling up of investigations in outbreak-prone countries, at the same time allowing the search for more accurate and faster diagnostic tools to proceed unhindered.",21.401773513716968,11.77001205432105

Regarding performance, some technologies may be fully automated and multiplexed, but they are prohibitively expensive; some are cost-effective, but compromise sensitivity or multiplexity. In contrast, some solutions offer multiplexity, yet they are benchtop, require laptop, electricity, and are barely portable (due to size and weight). Regarding technology, most of the described platforms implement nucleic acid amplification (PCR-or isothermal-based) and almost none of them includes a parallel immunoassay analysis to measure the host response to an infection. A few of the suggested approaches are equipment-free but therefore lack connectivity and interfacing ability. However, one can observe a common rationale in the structure of the described technologies. The vast majority are based on the combination of three components: the assay, the cartridge, and the readout device. Several variations may exist in the format of the assay, the cartridge, or the detection principle; however, this three-element model seems to be the backbone of all described diagnostic platforms. This modular nature should motivate the developers and manufacturers to consider more (semi)open and adaptable platforms to address end-users' needs in a dynamic way, being able to quickly modify their panels and adapt to endemic or epidemic needs.",26.43654169815626,11.567439355077806

Under GHSA, many countries are undertaking efforts to identify and prioritize zoonotic diseases of greatest national concern through a One Health approach (i.e., linking human, environmental, and animal health) (37) . This approach helps a country focus limited resources for surveillance, laboratory capacity building, outbreak response, and prevention and control efforts and helps to enhance communication, collaboration, and engagement across critical sectors of government. With technical assistance from experts on zoonotic and emerging infectious diseases, many countries have initiated surveillance to establish etiologies of acute febrile illness. These efforts have begun to increase countries' capacity to collect sterile specimens; prepare, store, and ship specimens; and collect and report data to clinicians and surveillance systems. Acute febrile illness surveillance has contributed to countries' understanding of etiologies and pathogen-specific disease burden and can inform clinical algorithms and care and treatment of patients with acute febrile illness. GHSA implementation has demonstrated that enhancing disease-specific capacity improves national public health capacity building overall. Coordinated efforts between cholera experts and emergency management to prevent, detect, and respond to cholera in Cameroon have led to increasing timeliness of EOC activation for other outbreaks. Preventing zoonotic or emerging infectious diseases is one of the critical tenets of GHSA. CDC infection, prevention, and control experts are supporting efforts to build infection control and antimicrobial drug resistance capacity in 10 GHSA Phase I countries. During the West Africa Ebola epidemic, widespread gaps in infection, prevention, and control systems and resources led to outbreak amplification (38) .

This should be a requirement for all new diagnostic tests, but it is even more important for point-of-care tests that are often used in nonselected patients (for example, any patient with fever attending any level of the health system) and by users with no technical background. Before large-scale implementation in resource-limited countries is decided, the test should also preferably be endorsed by WHO and by international donors and governments that provide funding. Unfortunately, many point-of-care tests have been launched in the market with only limited laboratory validation using convenient patient samples (for example that have a high pathogen load), or even cultured pathogens in relatively high concentration. Field evaluation of the performance of the test in real patients, who often harbor low pathogen loads, is indeed often undertaken only after registration of the product. This is due to the lack of national and international regulatory mechanisms applicable to diagnostic tests, which, in contrast, exist for medicines [189] . The net result is that health workers, especially those working in private clinics, and even patients going to pharmacies, have access to POC tests that have in fact very low sensitivity and/or specificity.

These measures allow comparisons on a per-target basis, providing a much more specific use of these technologies for surveillance and allow epidemiological strength of associations and direction to be determined. Additionally, these measures are not restrictive to multiplex respiratory platforms, but could also be critically used for other classes of multiplex assays and panels (e.g. enteric panels, blood culture, meningitis).

Coincidently, many of these viral proteins share two biological features: (i) interacting with certain critical signaling molecule(s) for which translocation to specific antiviral platforms is required for optimal antiviral signaling; and (ii) locating in specific subcellular sites (virus-induced or cellular structures) discrete from the proper antiviral platforms. For instance, NY-1 hantavirus Gn is associated with TRAF3 through its cytoplasmic tail (Alff et al., 2008) and locates in Golgi apparatus (Schmaljohn and Nichol, 2007) ; HCV NS2 that can interact with TBK1/IKK1 (Kaukinen et al., 2013) is resident in endoplasmic reticulum (Popescu et al., 2011) ; New World arenaviruse Z proteins binding RIG-I target to cellular membranes (Fan et al., 2010) ; and intriguingly similar to SFTSV NSs, Ebola virus VP35 that interacts with TBK1/IKK1 (Prins et al., 2009 ) is localized in viral IBs as well (Groseth et al., 2009) . Previously, the physical mechanisms for antiviral signaling impairment were often proposed to be the inhibition of certain interactions or antiviral complex assembly via steric hindrance, competitive binding, or unknown means. In this study, we also detected the suppression of the interaction between the kinase IKK1 and upstream MAVS, but more importantly, spatial isolation was shown to be the further mechanism. It hence presents the first clear instance of spatial isolation from antiviral platforms and prompts the possibility that this may be the direct reason for the interruption of antiviral signaling at least in some cases, in consideration that the spatial isolation of the essential component(s) likely hinders interactions and complex assembly on antiviral platforms. Thus, spatial isolation from antiviral platforms may be a common and radical strategy employed by many viruses to interrupt host antiviral IFN signaling ( Figure 8C ).",20.078728342870733,12.053010025309474

First, results should be interpreted in the context of the entire colony and the health monitoring program. Decisions about rodent health should rarely if ever be made on a single positive result and the latter should be assumed to be a false positive until verified (Laber-Laird and Proctor, 1993; Compton and Riley, 2001; Livingston and Riley, 2003) . Verification may include testing a sample (serum) using an alternative test platform, testing a second sample from the affected animals using an alternative test platform (for example, through PCR), or testing cohort animals (Weisbroth et al., 1998; Livingston and Riley, 2003) . As discussed earlier, there are two primary serologic testing platforms: ELISA and IFA. These platforms can also be used as adjuncts for each other. In most diagnostic laboratories, the ELISA serves as the primary test, and borderline or solitary positive results are confirmed by IFA. Confirmatory testing may also involve the use of different testing platforms. For example, if a rat is found to be seropositive for CAR bacillus, the lungs may be examined with a silver stain to detect the presence of GLEN OTTO AND CRAIG L. FRANKLIN the organism. Often, only serum is collected for health monitoring, so samples for confirmatory testing by other platforms may not be possible. In these cases, testing of cohort animals may be warranted and a diagnostic plan to test with different testing platforms should be designed. For example, if a rat is found to be seropositive for a rat parvovirus, additional animals from that colony may be tested by serology and their mesenteric lymph nodes may concurrently be tested by PCR for rat parvovirus. Testing of cohort animals is also warranted in the case where very few animals are seropositive. This scenario may indicate an early outbreak or a false positive result. If an early outbreak is occurring, cohort animals will have additional time to seroconvert and the percentage of positives should increase.",25.709282826530682,10.61361241877249

While the finding is consistent with health information sharing literature on Twitter (McLaughlin et al., 2016) , it contradicts sharing health news via email and Facebook (Kim, 2015) . Different media platforms can affect what people talk about and share (Berger & Iyengar, 2013) and thus may explain the discrepancies in those findings. Email and Facebook networks involve a great number of pre-existing social relations (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2011) , while Twitter network may involve a larger number of strangers or very weak ties as following a Twitter user typically does not require a mutual agreement from both relational parties (Hansen, Arvidsson, Nielsen, Colleoni, & Etter, 2011) . Social bonding is an important motivation when sharing information with pre-existing social relations (Berger, 2014) . Sharing positive emotions helps build a positive self-image and maintain positive interpersonal relationships. However, when communicating with very weak ties, it may be less important to be a positive or a nice person. Instead, sharing negative-tone messages may attract more attentions from others. Information that arouses negative emotion may signal danger and thus are more urgent and useful (McLaughlin et al., 2016) . In addition, passing along negative tweets may show a person's discriminating judgement and heightened cynical sophistication (Cappella et al., 2015) , just like we tend to perceive book review writers as more intelligent and competent when they provide negative as opposed to positive reviews (Amabile, 1983) .

In 1977, Sanger et al. developed a method that revealed the first complete genome sequence of a virus. 43 This 'first generation sequencing' used capillaryeelectrophoresis methods to sequence DNA fragments, a process that was expensive and slow. 44 The terms 'second generation' or 'next generation' sequencing (NGS) refer to methods that parallelize the sequencing process, thus dramatically lowering costs and increasing capacity. NGS first became available in 2004 and a number of different sequencing platforms are currently commercially available. 45 These include the Illumina Platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), 454 genome sequencer (Roche Applied Science, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), SOLiD platform (Life Technologies, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as well as the first bench-top machines such as the MiSeq (Illumina) and IonTorrent platforms (Life Technologies) which are anticipated to be among the first platforms to be routinely implemented for clinical applications. Late in 2012 it is anticipated that the GridION platform (Oxford Nanopore, Oxford, UK) will enter the marketplace. 46 Genome assembly Sequencing machines generate thousands of small DNA sequences, called reads, which can be between 40 and 1000 base pairs in length depending on the technique used. Each read represents the sequence of a small fraction of the genome. The reads overlap so that each position of the genome is included in several reads. This number is called 'the coverage'. To be useful, the reads need to be assembled into the whole genome sequence. This can be done in one of two ways; either by comparison with a previously sequenced 'reference' strain (mapping-based assembly), or by piecing the reads together on the basis of their overlaps (de novo assembly). 47, 48 Mapping-based assembly produces results that are easier to interpret, but are dependent upon the choice of reference genome, so that sequences not present in the reference genome remain unmapped. In principle, de novo assembly can recover the whole genome, but in practice it returns several assembled regions (called contigs) whose further assembly tends to remain unresolved. In either case, longer read lengths and higher coverage make assembly easier and more accurate. 49 Storing the reads for a single S. aureus genome requires about 1 GB of storage space; roughly equivalent to 10 music albums in MP3 format. The term highthroughput sequencing is used to refer to newer sequencing technologies that can generate sequence data faster and more economically than previous platforms. Consequently, sequencing platforms are rated according to their throughput speeds, set-up and processing costs and length of reads produced. 45 A medium-sized sequencing facility can process thousands of bacterial isolates in a year. New platforms (Oxford Nanopore and Ion Proton) offer the promise of projected cost reductions to the order of US $1,000 for a whole human genome, sequenced in 15 min to 2 h. Such performance would translate into sequencing costs for bacteria of about US $1 per whole genome.",20.98990796393491,9.457010954968313

Association and/or dissociation of bioagents/molecules onto metal nanoparticles lead to changes in the wavelength. Each modification on the metal nanoparticle surface causes a peak shift at the maximum extinction wavelength and enables a broad window for spectral measurements with a high signal-to-noise ratio. 17 Thus, these biosensing approaches have been used in various biochemical sensing platforms and spectroscopies allowing picomolar sensitivity to detect protein and nucleic acid interactions. [18] [19] [20] However, there are a number of engineering and sampling challenges in both production and clinical testing of metal nanoparticle-based detection methods. First, typical chemical and physical modifications of nanoparticles (e.g., plasma treatment and exposure to highly acidic conditions) can lead to irreversible aggregation, resulting in degradation of optical characteristics. 21 Also, existing nanoparticle-based pathogen detection methods have suffered from challenges associated with direct exposure to unprocessed whole blood, including non-specific binding and requirement for extensive sample preparation, thus reducing clinical relevance for POC applications. Currently, diagnostic tests (e.g., PCR and ELISA) require sample preprocessing including plasma separation to prevent inaccuracies in signal amplification and quantification steps.

These studies provide data on the risk for illnesses or death in a population but may also be implemented in preparation for intervention trials (see below). Prospective surveillance studies are expensive due to the large costs for case-capture, diagnostic verification, treatment and data management. Frequently, it is necessary to conduct a census to have an accurate and up-to-date denominator.

Collating and analysing existing information is relatively cheap and quick, may be useful to assess trends and may provide a nation-or region-wide picture but its limitations need to be kept in mind. The quality of the assessment depends on the data used to reach it. For example, reliance on public agencies' estimates of a disease, which may be inflated to increase public attention and consequently increase funding, will distort global calculations. The World Health Organization (WHO) compiles more comprehensive health data annually but the accuracy of reporting varies between diseases and across countries. 3 These estimates rely on routine notification, which may be weakened by over-and under-diagnosis, incomplete reporting and delays. Reporting of some diseases may be suppressed due to social taboos (e.g. HIV/AIDS) or the fear of trade sanctions (e.g. cholera).",22.77928758612783,11.63184718224435

However, the issue of mosquito control or combatting Zika, dengue, and chikungunya never arose spontaneously. Evidence from candidates' campaign platforms also shows that, while basic health is a highly salient issue in municipal politics, fighting mosquito-borne illnesses is not. Candidates for executive office are required to file their campaign platforms with Brazil's electoral agency; we downloaded these platforms for all mayoral candidates in Pernambuco's 2016 elections and converted them to searchable text.

When asked about the ''Aedes aegypti situation"" in the municipality, participants mentioned dengue or chikungunya but never Zika. 9 People were familiar with the ACE and the municipality's role in combatting disease, and they were generally satisfied with these efforts-a stark contrast to the frequent complaints about basic health.

Countries with limited financial and human resources must prioritize planning for the most immediate and dire threats, and preparedness planning can seem an unaffordable luxury of time and resources. CDC and other international partners have provided technical assistance and resources, but transitioning to managing public health emergencies through a PHEOC still requires major commitment and input from a ministry of health to progress from having functionality to being fully operational.

This user-friendly system can be modified to perform ELISA with fluorescent optical detection, bringing the cost per test down to a reasonable level. These diagnostic kits will be available in a ready-to-use format and not do it yourself. Palm-sized RT-PCR systems for RNA detention have already been developed (Ahrberg et al. 2016a (Ahrberg et al. , 2016b as well as complex stationary sample-answer systems based on RT-PCR (Nash et al., 2017) . We envision the miniaturization of sample preparation followed by RT-PCR for viral RNA diagnosis. However, the sample volume needed to be processed for diseases with a low viral load, such as HIV, prevents the sample from being directly processed by LOC. This problem can be solved by adding a sample pre-concentration step where the viruses or the RNA from a volume of tens or hundreds of μL will be concentrated to a few μL and then processed by the LOC system. This would be ideally performed in a touch-free manner to avoid possible contamination of the person handling the blood, which would be irrelevant if the infected person were handling his/her own sample. Nevertheless, minimal human intervention is essential, and thus the development should lead to a sample-to-answer system. Smartphone platforms will be heavily used as they have high resolution cameras and test results can be directly sent to the medical personnel or heath centers monitoring the infectious disease outbreak. Connecting all these diagnostic systems with centers and large dataprocessing facilities will form a true IoT (Zhu et al., 2020) for healthcare authorities. User-friendly software for data acquisition and analysis can be developed using Android or different operating systems to increase public safety.

Gaining rapidly in popularity, are ABI's Ion Torrent and Pacific Biosciences' PacBio. (For a recent review of the commercially available platforms; see [33] ). These technologies produce massive parallelization of clonal amplification of nucleotide sequences, greatly facilitating the identification of individual virus strains in genetically heterogeneous populations ( Figure 1B) . Because of the very high sequencing redundancy (i.e., depth of coverage) of these new platforms, and the relatively small size of virus genomes, the multiplexing of multiple virus isolates, barcoded so they can be sequenced simultaneously but with their respective sequences characterized individually, is now possible. This approach is also particularly appropriate for the characterization of drugresistance mutations in a viral population in order to determine the prevalence of the mutations before they become dominant and lead to the emergence of resistant strains. Direct PCR product sequencing (the classical approach) has its limitations, and is usually used to detect prevalence above 20% within an infected host [34] . Sequencing multiple clones is labor intensive and costly, although it has high sensitivity. The NextGen platforms enable the analysis of sequence reads generated from each of the amplified molecules, as well as the identification of very low frequencies of pre-existing mutations that could lead to the emergence of a new phenotype. Studies using GS-FLX or GAIIx to identify rare drugresistant variants in HIV, HCV and HBV [34] [35] [36] [37] demonstrate the strength of this approach to clarify the genetic complexity of these viral populations. In chronic infections such as HCV and HIV, the characterization of genetic diversity within each infected patient is limited by the very high heterogeneity of the population. In a recent study on HIV-I dynamics, deep molecular characterization was used to identify viral populations that persist in the patient under suppressive therapy [38] . Low-level viremia limits the characterization of virions that remain in HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy. But while plasma viral load may be undetectable at less than 50 RNA copies per ml, deepsequencing data of the selectively amplified reverse-transcriptase genes isolated from episomal and integrated HIV-1 DNA paint a much clearer picture of the existence of reservoirs within the host [39] .",21.86053997717751,10.845244149911984

Robust surveillance systems in wildlife and at the livestock-wildlife interface to provide early detection of newly emerging EIDs or spillover and spillback of pathogens between livestock and wildlife is essential. Developing a comprehensive national monitoring system for EIDs in wildlife that is logistically and fiscally sustainable could yield economic benefits for livestock health management as a whole by reducing indemnity costs associated with spillover of disease from wildlife to livestock or by helping prevent spillover from livestock to wildlife through early detection. The objectives of such a system could be enhanced by close integration with existing livestock and wildlife health programs to guide ""when"", ""where"", and ""how"" surveillance is conducted. In addition, existing programs would benefit from closer working relationships between wildlife biologists, ecologists, epidemiologists, and veterinarians to improve efforts focused on reducing pathogen transmission (Boadella et al., 2011) . One obstacle to developing long-term, comprehensive surveillance efforts at the livestock-wildlife interface is inconsistent funding for these activities (Leighton et al., 1997; Stitt et al., 2007) . Funding has typically been in response to emergency directives (e.g. HPAI H5N1 surveillance) and focused for a short period until the threat is perceived to no longer exist. This has, predictably, generated problems for developing a comprehensive national infrastructure that can be maintained over the long-term. In addition, there are disease systems that have plagued agriculture for decades, such as bovine tuberculosis, that do not obtain sufficient levels of funding to fully address risks for introduction into new wildlife hosts such as feral swine (Sweeney and Miller, 2010) . Another challenge faced by wildlife surveillance systems is that they often rely on hunter observations and reports, which are focused on game species. This increases the difficulty of identifying emergence of disease in non-game species. Finally, due to challenges associated with working across agency departmental boundaries, such as reduced communication, differing priorities, perceived competition in missions, and cultural differences wildlife surveillance efforts often remain less than fully coordinated which reduces their overall benefit.",21.644968587409792,13.343963650254377

The most detailed progress is currently available for the rVSV and rAd5 vaccine platforms. While the DNA vaccine alone has been tested in a Phase I clinical trial, its immunogenicity is less than desirable and it requires multiple immunizations over a long time period. The requirement for multiple immunizations makes this platform difficult to implement in filovirus-endemic regions, where vaccination of the entire population is probably logistically and financially impossible. However, it may be useful for vaccinating individuals with high potential exposure risks (e.g. biosafety level-4 workers, front-line hospital staff/first responders and members of agencies who work in endemic areas). While these groups are useful targets for vaccination, the most at-risk population would be unlikely to benefit from such a vaccine. The addition of rAd5 in a prime-boost regimen or rAd5 alone is probably of more utility; however, a method to overcome pre-existing Ad5 immunity has not been definitely proven in the nonhuman primate model. Multiple options to avoid or circumvent pre-existing immunity while still using an Ad vector have been presented, although none of these methods has been thoroughly tested in a nonhuman primate challenge model.

Systems in developing countries face many operational challenges, including a lack of accurate and timely information exchange between local, provincial, national and regional levels, and inadequate human resource and laboratory capacity for speedy diagnosis. The WHO's Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases 2010 highlights the need for community involvement in surveillance. 2 Zoonotic disease detection and control also depends on effective veterinary surveillance and the ability to contain outbreaks amongst animal populations, systems that are often poorly developed or nonexistent in developing countries. Jones et al. 5 suggest that local targeted surveillance of at-risk people may be the best way to prevent large-scale emergence. Brownstein et al. 6 in their discussion of web surveillance suggest that the use of news media and other non-traditional sources of surveillance data such as web-accessible discussion sites and disease reporting networks could facilitate early outbreak detection and increase public awareness of disease outbreaks prior to their formal recognition.

An alternative approach could be to deploy a viral microarray as an instrument of discovery rather than of routine detection, with the goal of identifying divergent or unexpected viruses that elude diagnosis using conventional methods. Once a new candidate pathogen was identified, a specific PCR-based or DFA-based assay could then be developed to detect the virus with a high degree of sensitivity in clinical samples.

Here, binding and fusion is studied by monitoring liposomes decorated with host cell receptors interacting with the planar virus-like bilayer containing embedded viral proteins [59] [60] [61] . Such an arrangement could be used for screening applications of antivirals that target entry processes, without the need for live virus or pseudotyped particles. In summary, biomimetic platforms enable a level of environmental control that cannot be attained in live cell particle tracking techniques. First, there is a degree of control over the host cell membrane mimic's composition that is difficult to alter in live cells. Second, in these platforms, the buffers in contact with the virus can have a defined composition and the experimenter controls the timing and order of exposure to proteases, pH, or any other component of interest to the virus. But perhaps the most salient feature of this experimental approach is that these platforms allow detailed examination of the binding and membrane fusion process and gathering of dynamic data from these processes. However, the two-dimensional, in vitro nature of these platforms make them unsuitable for measuring cytoskeletal involvement in entry. Thus, to obtain the most complete information about the infection process, combining data from complementary approaches using live cells and biomimetic platforms is an excellent strategy.",21.310035830575448,10.094777168873327

As long ago as 1983, experts from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and WHO described foodborne illness as the most widespread health problem in the modern world. While the impacts of foodborne illness may have been overshadowed by a host of other emerging infectious diseases in the past 3 decades, the impact of diarrheal disease occurring as a result of contaminated food remains profound. It is estimated that up to 70% of the 1.5 billion episodes of diarrhea occurring in children under 5 every year may be caused by foodborne contaminants. 27 FDA works to address food safety challenges in a number of ways. For example, through regulatory efforts such as FSMA, FDA is focusing on strengthening food safety systems through efforts to ensure product safety, modernize the oversight of imported foods, guard against intentional contamination, implement preventive controls in human and animal food/feed facilities, and ensure the safe transport of food and feed. Under FSMA, FDA has developed the International Capacity Building Plan, which charts a direction for how FDA prioritizes capacity building efforts based on risk and impact on public health, as well as FDA's partnerships with counterpart regulatory authorities, industry, and other organizations to achieve lasting food safety results. 28 Among its regulatory capacity efforts, FDA contributes to, and leverages, other global food safety efforts, including through supporting WHO's Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), which is working on a definitive report on the global burden of foodborne diseases; strengthening surveillance systems, alert networks, and information platforms, such as the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN); and working closely in the development and support of the Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP), a public-private partnership housed at the World Bank that is dedicated to strengthening food safety systems.",21.49178781107873,9.330097080255882

Hubs may perhaps offer the benefit of filtering signals from noise and collating them in a way that may facilitate the decision makers to make sense of them, however, this is done at the expense of a timely response and it may cause the loss of important signals in the process. Therefore, the emphasis should be put more in the availability of communication platforms for the detectors to transmit the captured signals to the decision makers rather than on complex, sophisticated (and expensive) 'fusion hubs' and filtering mechanisms. Ultimately, the successful signal detection depends more on the 'collective mind' and the shared sense of purpose within the organisation rather than on predetermined repertoires and databases. Consistent with the social exchange theory principles discussed earlier in the paper, the first and most basic stage of crisis signal detection may simply be the sharing of time sensitive information and existing knowledge in an opportune fashion (for example the DHS's ""See Something -Say Something"" campaign for terrorism). However, social exchange theory alone cannot capture the complexity of signal detection since, at more advanced levels of maturity, signal detection and the 'collective mind' move from the opportune transmission of 'what is' to identifying 'what could possibly be' and where the signals of known and unknown crises could be captured.",17.171743738355985,9.791697849527957

Such assays can be both sensitive and inexpensive. However, as the costs drop for MassTag PCR, microarrays and high throughput sequencing, multiplex assays are increasingly used as primary tools for syndromic surveillance, studies of microbial diversity and discovery. Sensitivity can be a challenge with multiplex platforms. In multiplex PCR reactions sensitivity decreases with increasing primer complexity. Microarrays and deep sequencing typically employ unbiased amplification methods wherein host and microbial sequences can compete for polymerase and nucleotides. Improvements in sensitivity can be achieved by using methods that deplete host DNA, ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences through enzymatic digestion or subtractive hybridization before unbiased amplification. One can also pursue positive selection using oligonucleotides representing microbes of interest. With high throughput sequencing bioinformatics is frequently the weakest link. The least expensive platforms (e.g. Illumina) typically produce shorter sequence reads that can be difficult to assemble. More expensive platforms (e.g. 454 Life Sciences) typically yield longer but fewer reads; hence, assembly is easier but at a cost of lower coverage. One solution is to join such platforms and use the longer reads to establish a scaffold that can be completed using the shorter reads.

It is unquestionable the advantage that the very high frequency of optical signals -compared, for instance, with electrical ones -may bring in terms of the enormous amount of information that can be carried by optical devices. Some well-succeeded commercial platforms include, for example, the GeneChip ® high-density (high spatial resolution of individual probes) microarray from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA), with fluorescence-based detection coupled to a confocal readout, which became the industry standard for molecular biology research. This microarray probably encloses the highest information capacity among similar chips, enabling a wholegenome approach in research studies. The GeneChip ® can sequence some many thousand bases in a few days with almost very high accuracy, a clear advantage for pathogen subtyping. In addition, Affymetrix has largely benefited from its world leadership position as the first microarray ever commercialized and from resulting economical patent benefits. Moreover, this technology has exhibited improved performance and capabilities over other existing methods. Perhaps the most serious competitor for the GeneChip ® is the fluorescence-detecting microbead-based BeadXpress ® array system from Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA), also an industry-leading in genotyping. The high sensitivity of the BeadXpress ® (owing to inherent stringency of code detection), wide multiplexing capability, assay versatility in a single platform (including a broad range of applications, e.g. nucleic acid and protein-based assays) and dual-color detection (through the industry-standard Infinium Whole-Genome Genotyping Assay) are claimed highlights [80]. BIAcore (real-time biospecific interaction analysis) SPR-based platforms have been also at the forefront of the commercial biosensor market; so far, they have been responsible for 90% of all published optical biosensor work. The BIAcore system of Pharmacia Biosensor AB (Uppsala, Sweden), is especially suitable for real-time monitoring of biological events under continuous flow [6] . A carboxymethyl dextran matrix-coated surface has been widely employed in these systems as a convenient way for applying numerous surface immobilization chemistries, for immobilized ligand stabilization and for reducing non-specific binding. It is envisaged that many of these systems may be applied to several biochemical assays, including DNA-and protein-arrays, and eventually replace the well-known enzyme immuno-assay (EIA). It seems clear that implementing sensor arrays with multiple-sample delivery, while being simple in concept, will require improved technological development fueled by strong commercial demands [81] .",20.719943179438506,10.356503950369852

[17] used a more extensive approach for infectious disease surveillance based entirely on web-search terms for predicting outbreaks. Specifically, they used Google as the web-search tool for querying the frequency of the terms. They observed that people tend to search on the Internet for treatments and symptoms of a particular disease once they get sick. Hence, high frequency of a term (e.g., ""dengue"") could be an indication of an epidemic. Back in 2005 and 2006, there were a high frequency of the search term ""bird flu"" due to the global spread of bird flu, especially in China and Turkey. Models for predicting influenza and dengue were created based on the frequency of terms. Such an idea has been incorporated into platforms such as (i) Google Flu Trends and (ii) Google Dengue Trends 4 , which are no longer publishing current estimates of flu or dengue fever based on search patterns. Despite the positive impacts of their approach, they also observed that external factors (e.g., media influence, language barriers, false positives) may affect the number of searches not correlating with actual cases of diseases. For example, media can drive such scenarios depending on what they publish. As another example, the same terms can be used to describe a variety of different situations with no correlation to diseases. Hence, as their models would need to be validated in each specific scenario before being used by health agencies, the models were not yet ready as replacement of existing methods used by health agencies.",18.515064441288153,11.222591196590288

Change in HDI rank from 1990 to 2013 captures a sustained movement toward improved (or stymied) development. Polity in the year of the outbreak, however, illustrates a time-constrained snapshot of government status. Although our analysis across levels of polity did not reveal noteworthy trends (Table 8) , we found that the direction of change in HDI over time had a strong relationship with surveillance system success. Median discovery delay increased with worsening HDI quartile. Outbreaks in countries with the most positive change in HDI rank had the shortest median time to detection but the least reduction in delay (consistent with having the least room for improvement). The middle quartiles improved significantly, whereas the countries with the greatest decrease in HDI, or the most political and social instability, showed less improvement. Meanwhile, median communication delay was uniform across the HDI variable, aside from the lowest quartile, which had a significantly longer delay. That quartile was also the only quartile to show no improvement over time, although this was not significant (Figure 3, Although these results suggest that long-term national systemic improvements might foster surveillance system progress, it might be practical to begin with increased availability of and education regarding moderated digital disease reporting platforms.

We can see that improvements in the lead up to adoption of the revised IHR have been maintained with some year-specific fluctuation, and extreme delays have been eliminated.

In the year of the announcement, 350 000 cases of paralysis from polio were reported across 125 countries. 1 Today, over 2.5 billion children have since been immunised and, at the time of writing, there were 5 cases of polio in two countries, with only 37 cases reported in all of 2016. 2 Much of the success of global polio eradication efforts has rested on meticulous surveillance in the hardest to reach areas of the globe, and the principle of immunisation of every last child. As a result, between 1988 and 2017, GPEI's polio immunisation and acute flaccid paralysis (ALP) surveillance programme among children under 15 years of age-the gold standard for detecting poliomyelitis-are estimated to have avoided paralysis for 16 million children. 3 Such success has come at a significant financial cost, with over US$9 billion invested in polio eradication efforts since 1988. However, the economic returns to date are estimated to be $27 billion, with a further US$20 billion anticipated by 2035, and $17 billion from vitamin A supplementation delivered in parallel. 4 Witnessing interruption in transmission of polio virus will be a critical turning point for infectious disease control and surveillance. Yet, how the global community reacts and transitions in the coming years presents a unique opportunity to shape the future of surveillance-with ramifications reaching far beyond the immunisation, detection and management of polio alone. The increasing frequency of outbreaks of novel and existing pathogens adds a further imperative. 5 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Ebola virus disease, Zika virus, yellow fever and the threat of avian influenza have all presented surveillance and infection control challenges over the past 5 years.",19.001454621274764,11.94497358640216

For example, diagnostic tests have improved dramatically, allowing us to detect previously unknown pathogens. While it took approximately 2 years to identify the virus that caused acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the virus responsible for SARS was identified in approximately 2 weeks. In addition, linking data from different laboratories over large geographic distances has dramatically changed the way potential food-related outbreaks are detected and traced. For example, PulseNet USA is a molecular surveillance network that has been of assistance in numerous food-borne outbreaks 91 and similar networks exist or are under development in countries around the world. New molecular diagnostic platforms, coupled with increased surveillance efforts to detect new pathogens in both animals and humans, will continue to improve the ability to identify new pathogens more quickly. 92 In addition, the promise of point-of-care testing may dramatically reduce the time it takes to rule in or rule out specific pathogens in the field, without sending specimens to reference laboratories. 93 In response to the threat of emerging infectious diseases, many international cooperative efforts were initiated to build networks to enhance surveillance activities. An example is the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which unites several distinct networks to gather information about diseases in realtime, in order to detect and verify outbreaks around the world. 94 Other transnational networks focus on specific disease threats.

Because CoVs have demonstrated an accelerating pattern of zoonotic emergence since the 1980s [25, 41] , our data indicate that an appropriate diagnostic platform should include a large panel of phylogenetically distinct CoV S and N structural proteins, which must be validated using larger panels of antisera against other HCoVs in the general population. While molecularbased platforms like polymerase chain reaction and deep sequencing offer clear advantages in early detection of active infections, public health response platforms would be strengthened by the availability of recombinant proteins and subgroup-and type-specific antisera that can track subclinical infections, determine the prevalence of infection in populations, and identify hospital-acquired infections. A recent report identified subclinical cases of MERS-CoV infection through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the screen using the panel of recombinant proteins described here would have provided more-specific information about the presence of other CoVs in these cases [42] . The VRP platform we describe not only yields high-level expression of key recombinant proteins across the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, it also provides the first candidate vaccine vectors with the potential to augment the T-helper type 1-based immune responses to MERS-CoV infection and to reduce associated immune pathology. The VRP 3526-associated approach is also applicable to improving the public health response to and the control of future outbreaks of other highly pathogenic emerging infectious diseases due to CoV in human populations.",18.47671955640481,9.432577421619277

Several probe technologies (Fig. 1 ) have also been designed for real-time assays like TaqMan ( Fig. 1A ) or molecular beacons (Fig. 1B) in which a quencher molecule is removed from the vicinity of the fluorescent marker upon binding to RNA or DNA generated during amplification cycles.

It is prudent to understand nurses' intent to respond, as the capacity of hospitals is directly related to the number of staff nurses available to care for the influx of patients during disasters. 5 Because nurses are invaluable to disaster response efforts, more research is necessary to validate findings of recent studies and clarify the needs of nurses who respond to disasters and other health emergencies. Existing literature does not adequately describe the needs of nurses while working during disaster situations, nor is it clear why nurses do or do not respond.

However, these frameworks have two limitations. First, while both focus on public health competencies in great depth, they do not fully address the broader range of non-health system factors, including institutional, financial and infrastructural capacities, which are also fundamental building blocks for effective response to infectious disease epidemics. For example, the JEE includes an indicator for ‘Linking Public Health and Security Authorities’, which is important for assessing the coordination between these institutions.

Actions taken by certain countries during the SARS epidemic, especially China's attempts to conceal disease information, precipitated these new WHO powers to overcome selfish state interests. Despite this apparent victory of global health over narrow state interests, a number of countries and commentators have argued that the IHRs actually undervalue “equity between developed and developing nations” (86, p. 482) and risk fragmentation of poor countries’ health systems and “national health priorities set up by developing countries” (87, p. 13). These objections center on the IHRs’ primary focus on disease surveillance, which some argue may be of greater importance to wealthy countries seeking protection from new epidemics than for poor countries with large existing disease burdens (87). Thus, “the WHO's authority in infectious disease control has been strengthened partly because it suited the interests of Western states to allow this to happen” (88, p. 308).

Diagnostic expertise was particularly important in this case, as the pandemic strain had to be detected against a background of other circulating influenza A strains and other respiratory viruses causing influenza-like illness.32 The influenza example demonstrates the positive impact that collaboration between global and national stakeholders and industry can have on the speed and effectiveness of response. Similar networks of diagnostic experts and laboratories for other relevant pathogens that can be activated in the event of an outbreak would greatly improve research and development times.

Reinforcement of surveillance capacity of weaker healthcare systems, including education of healthcare workers and implementation of surveillance laboratory networks, is critical to allow earlier identification of outbreaks and more effective isolation of cases. The influenza pandemic of 2009–2010 shows how effective a robust global surveillance network can be32; in particular, the mentoring system that was employed to provide support for countries with lower technical abilities from those with stronger diagnostic capacity was a successful measure that could be implemented for other pathogens. In contrast, the recent yellow fever and Zika outbreaks clearly demonstrate the negative impact of poor surveillance.7 8 The absence of a specific marker for Zika surveillance was largely responsible for the wide spread of the disease, as without surveillance information, effective control measures could not be put in place.8 The disconnect between surveillance findings and provision of vaccines negatively impacted the containment response to the yellow fever outbreak.7 Ensuring that national-level laboratories are equipped to test for a wide range of diseases and that they work in interconnected diagnostic networks would significantly improve epidemic containment times, and the ability to transform surveillance laboratories for routine testing in outbreak situations would also relieve pressure on testing centres. Linking diagnostics and vaccines in a common health programme would help to ensure that vaccines are delivered in a timely manner to the most at-risk populations. For pathogens with significant animal reservoirs, such as the Nipah and CCHF viruses, collection and integration of animal surveillance data may also be a necessary component of any outbreak preparedness strategy.15 17 A ‘One Health’ approach to surveillance that integrates human, animal and ecological health would provide earlier opportunities for outbreak detection and prevention; however, a number of challenges to implementing such an approach exist, including need for greater cross-sectoral communication, strengthening of laboratory networks, restructuring of existing systems, and development of shared databases, shortage of experienced personnel and limited availability of diagnostic tests suitable for animal use.37

One approach to building sustainable facilities at country level is the development of flexible diagnostic platforms that can rapidly adopt tests for different pathogens. Multipathogen panels are particularly valuable for initial detection and monitoring of outbreak-causing pathogens, allowing rapid response without undue taxing of human resources through diversion of attention from other tasks, additional training requirements or need for implementation of new supply chains.22 Additionally, diagnostics that require limited sample preparation would reduce training needs and minimise the risk to laboratory workers, and so would be particularly advantageous for pathogens that are easily transmittable and/or cause severe disease. Indeed, the delay between the index case and the identification of Ebola as the causative agent during the 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic was partially due to a lack of appropriate high-level containment facilities at the lower levels of healthcare, meaning that samples had to be sent to a central laboratory.2

Given the professional and scientific background of the Committee members it is fully understandable that they concentrated on the scientific and technical aspects of the problem and not on the political and security aspects. In fact, Miller and Selgelid’s approach also clearly emphasises both consequences and intentions. For example, they explicitly state: “For something to be an instance of a dual use dilemma both outcomes (the two horns of the dual use dilemma) need to be (actually or potentially) intended…” (Miller and Selgelid 2008, p. 12).

The first of these is that the capacity for detection of international imported cases is 100% sensitive and specific across locations. While we know of no reason to doubt specificity of detection, we tested the assumption of perfect sensitivity. Based on our previous estimates 5 we assumed Singapore has the highest capacity of surveillance with respect to COVID-19. We regressed the cumulative cases against Wuhan-to-location air travel volume considering Singapore to have the greatest detection capacity and estimating the relative underdetection compared to Singapore in the remaining 190 locations classified according to the GHS 2 index 9 . While it is unlikely that this index reflects the true ranking of countries for any specific epidemic, such as the current one of COVID-19, we assume that it captures different levels of surveillance capacity.
