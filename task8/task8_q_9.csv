By acting on some targets with different intensities, we believe that IFN-λ and IFN-α act in concert to better control tumor development in vivo. Therefore, to achieve better treatments for viral diseases or cancers, we believe that the development of a combination therapy rather than the use of each IFN alone will be more beneficial for the patients. The combination of IFNs with other cytokines, growth factors, or their antagonists could also be an important strategy for the improvement of the IFN therapy. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) which plays a dual role in cancer, mediating tumor-suppresive activities at early stages and prooncogenic activities at later stages of tumor progression [95, 96] , could represent one potentially important modulator or mediator of the IFN response.

Furthermore, we included thrombocytopenia of ,100610 9 /L as a criteria for severe CHIKF. Marked thrombocytopenia is a common feature of sepsis [25] and has been identified as a predictor of mortality [26, 27] . The degree of thrombocytopenia is a determinant of survival and once the platelet count decreases below 100610 9 /L, mortality continues to increase, even though the risk of bleeding does not [28] . A wide spectrum of disease has been reported in CHIKF ranging from asymptomatic infections, to self-limiting febrile illness [8] , to neurologic complications, and death [17] . The ''severe illness'' cohort in our study possibly represents a more severe form of selflimiting febrile illness, an intermediate group with higher levels of viremia (data not shown) and distinctly more severe clinical features (i.e. high temperature, tachycardia, and severe thrombocytopenia). Using this clinical phenotype, we have shown in this study that immune mediators are able to distinguish very mild disease from more severe forms of CHIKF disease at the acute stage. Follow-up studies will be required to determine if long-term sequelae are indeed different between non-severe and severe clinical presentations. Elucidating the association of disease severity with two cytokines and one chemokine can be useful in order to provide early identification and monitoring of patients with severe disease. Although this study is limited by the size of the outbreak, nevertheless, based on these observations, measurement of immune mediators could be helpful for the management of future outbreaks. This study strongly suggests these biomarkers be used for measuring disease severity and be tested in outbreaks in different populations and different strains. Once confirmed, they will be useful for follow-up studies, association studies, and prognosis for public health management. More importantly, these biomarkers can potentially lead to the development of modulators to reduce disease severity and to halt disease progression. ",30.981249043007658,12.916898304254797

These differences were due to nature of parasite, their mode of infection, antigenic variations and many other factors.

However, imagine if we could identify genetic variants that are associated with an increased likelihood of contracting Ebola, spreading it, having more severe disease or responding to treatment. An ethical tension would arise if we were to consider screening at-risk populations for such variants and using the genomic information to influence a range of clinical and public health decisions. For example, in the absence of effective interventions and sufficient facilities to treat everyone, genetic information might be used to triage patients at greatest risk of severe disease to receive care first.

As a multi-functional cytokine, IL-6 has been shown to be required for the virus clearance and mouse survival through modulating neutrophil release and recruitment, and pivotal for the antibody production by promoting the differentiation of B cells (6, 7) . Further, IL-6 prevents tissue destruction through elevating the secretion of cytoprotective cytokine IL-22 (9, 10) .

In addition the type of TB disease that children develop is age-dependent. The youngest children typically develop either intrathoracic lymph node disease (in which the mycobacteria are generally confined) or widely disseminated disease, including miliary TB and TB meningitis (reflecting poorly contained mycobacteria and unchecked proliferation). As children enter adolescence, the typical adult-type disease begins to manifest, with apical cavities and parenchymal breakdown, reflecting pathology largely caused by the host immune response. Although some societal and behavioral elements may influence these age-related changes in risk of disease progression and resulting disease phenotype, it is likely that to a large extent these result from age-related changes in the host immune system.

Detectable p24-specific T cell proliferation defines the immunocompetent recall response to viral antigen, and when spikes of viral replication were detected in these individuals, these cells likely provided T cell help for maintaining functional antiviral effector responses by other CD4 and CD8 T cells, including noncytolytic antiviral mechanisms [41] , and may also provide T cell help for efficient generation of NAb by HIV-specific B cells.

Furthermore, we anticipate the continual refinement and development of novel genome-based approaches as sequencing becomes faster and more affordable. Several challenges remain, however, in the identification of these targets and in the processes needed to bring a new vaccine or drug to the market. Understanding the molecular nature of epitopes, the mechanisms of action of adjuvants, and T cell and mucosal immunity are key priorities to be tackled in the coming years [3] . These issues can be addressed by improved structural studies of antigen epitopes and the compilation of databases containing information on structure, immunogenicity, and in silico B cell and T cell epitope predictions. Genome-based development of effective vaccines and therapeutics is still largely dependent on the availability of valid models to measure efficacy and protection against disease; however, the increased understanding of microbial pathogenesis that is emerging from genomics should greatly aid in this respect. Likewise, the continued development of animal models with knockout and allele-specific mutations in key components of the immune response will greatly increase understanding of the type of immune response needed to control disease and the ways in which the immune system can be programmed to protect the host against disease. Unfortunately, the stepwise series of prelicensure clinical trials (Phase I, II, and III) that are required to document the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a vaccine are still highly time-consuming and costly. We can only hope that the increasingly ''smart'' identification and design of targets, and the fresh impetuous given to the fields of vaccine and drug development by the arrival of genomics, will enable increased success of those vaccines and drugs that do make it into clinical development.",28.490874649687065,10.63721738848707

Among the available therapeutic options, dental extraction, antibiotics and corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually recommended [2, 9] . Due to the doubtful efficacy of NSAIDs over the medium term, long-acting corticosteroids are more frequently used in first-opinion clinical practice [2, 3, 9] . They are historically described as a good therapeutic approach to FCGS due to the fact that they reduce oral inflammation and control immune-mediated causes, leading to a rapid improvement, an increased appetite and a relief of oral pain [2, 3, 9] . In spite of their short-term efficacy at controlling the symptoms of the syndrome, long-acting corticosteroids are also a well-known cause of insulin-resistance [10, 11] , by inducing chronic hyperglycemia which can lead to a glucotoxic beta-cell insufficiency [10] . Therefore, being a potential cause of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) in cats, long-acting corticosteroid use is controversial in this species in general.",33.64902510389407,14.122047086066521

To determine whether the minimal models developed above for a primary and a secondary dengue infection are able to recover the well-established pattern of increased risk of severe disease in a heterologous secondary infection, we consider a disease severity formulation under two different parametrizations. The first parametrization assumes that T-cell-secreted cytokines do not impact the development of severe disease, whereas the second assumes that T cells may act to exacerbate disease severity (although they cannot alone precipitate severe disease).",36.4553765426394,13.818990577221992

Some critical issues have yet to be addressed regarding the role of autophagy in therapeutics and diagnostics. There are few efficient markers for studying autophagy modulation and those that exist have limitations. These markers are important for determining the effect of autophagy on disease initiation and progression. Furthermore, autophagy modulating drugs are imprecise and nonspecific; hence, more specific drugs are required. Similarly, autophagy upregulation appears to be beneficial for removing misfolded and aggregated proteins, intracellular pathogens, damaged mitochondria, and other organelles; however, it is not yet clear how selective autophagy could be upregulated in other situations. These are just some of the questions that need to be addressed in order to use autophagy as a therapeutic molecular process.

Specifically, a theory known as original antigenic sin (OAS) proposes that memory T-cell populations with low avidity for the infecting virus of a heterologous secondary infection cause a strong pro-inflammatory response, as would any memory T-cell population activated by a secondary infection. Yet, because of their low avidity, the ability of these T cells to lyse infected cells, and thereby to protect against viral infection, may be poor [7, 68] . In support of OAS, a study of dengue virus-specific T-cell responses in Thai children showed that the majority of dengue virus-specific T cells were of low affinity for the infecting serotype but had high affinity to one of the other three serotypes [68] . This study also showed that patients with DSS had stronger T-cell responses than individuals with less severe disease. In contrast to these pathologic effects of T cells, recent studies have suggested that T cells may instead play a protective role against severe disease [27, 28, 66] . Specifically, Weiskopf et al. showed that individuals with a strong T-cell response were associated with an HLA allele that appears to confer protection from severe disease [28] . They further showed that in transgenic mice, heterologous secondary infections responses directed to serotype-specific epitopes were impaired, but responses to conserved epitopes were not, suggesting that heterologous secondary infections are associated with a limited T-cell response [69] . Dung et al. [27] further documented a temporal mismatch between CD8 þ T-cell activation and vascular leakage, suggesting that T-cell-secreted cytokines do not contribute to the development of severe disease.",29.657874815109437,13.468046757931583

Using sequential plasma samples collected over three years post-infection in a cohort of MSM HIV-1 seroconvertors, we determined the early kinetics of cytokine levels during FiebigI-IV stages using Luminex-based multiplex assays. Cytokines were quantified and relationships between cytokines were assessed by Spearman correlation. Compared with HIV-negative MSM, HIV-infected individuals had significantly increased multiple plasma cytokines, including GM-CSF, IFN-α2, IL-12p70, IP-10 and VEGF, during both acute and chronic stages of infection. Furthermore, rapid disease progressors (RDPs) had earlier and more robust cytokine storms, compared with slow disease progressors (SDPs) (49.6 days vs. 74.9 days, respectively; 6.7-fold vs. 3.7-fold change of cytokines, respectively), suggesting the faster and stronger cytokine storm during AHI could promote disease progression. On the other hand, HIV-1 infection induced more interlocked cytokines network, establishing new strong correlations and imposing a higher rigidity. There were, respectively, 146 (44.9%) statistically significant correlations of cytokines in RDPs and 241 (74.2%) in SDPs (p < 0.001). This study suggests that immunomodulatory interventions aimed at controlling cytokine storm in AHI may be beneficial to slow eventual disease progression. When the immune system is fighting pathogens, cytokines activate immune cells such as T cells and macrophages, stimulating them to produce more cytokines resulting in so-called cytokine storms or cascades 1,2 . There is growing evidence that the immune responses initiated during acute HIV infection can play critical roles in modulating of disease progression. Several studies investigated the cascade of cytokine production in the periphery and show an initial rapid production of IFN-α , followed by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α , inducible protein (IP)-10, and interleukin (IL)-18, IL-10 and IFN-γ production, while others have not observed these changes or have reported opposing findings 3-8 . The discrepancies likely reflect the diversity and unity of dynamics during AHI but also could be due in part to the variation in the timing of sample collection among studies. Some studies were cross-sectional, while others focused on time points relatively late in AHI 9,10 . The cytokine storms during AHI can act as a double-edged sword, as they have the potential to cause significant damage to virus-specific immunity but also inhibit infection by reducing T cell recruitment and activation 11 . Some studies show that type I-IFN plays a role in slowing disease progression by inducing multiple antiviral genes and limiting initial viral replication, while others have reported that type I-IFN signaling is linked to immune activation and viral persistence and blocking of type I-IFN during LCMV infection enhances viral clearance 12-14 . These contradictory reports suggest that there is a need to investigate the dynamic of cytokines in natural HIV-1 infection.",30.05577633956031,13.436407690869117

Instead, our parametrization is based on well-established viral features. While statistical fits to data, as performed by Clapham et al. [25] , are extremely valuable, the lack of available viral and immunological data early in dengue infection is currently a limiting factor in robustly estimating model parameters. This underscores the importance of large longitudinal cohort studies in facilitating the collection of these types of data. The Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study in Nicaragua [72] , for example, routinely tests children for dengue, and detects inapparent as well as symptomatic infections. This type of study should be able to obtain detailed viral measurements early in infection, specifically before viraemia peaks. Along with viral kinetic data, more detailed kinetic data of NK-and T-cell activation markers in relation to the timing of vascular leakage, the hallmark of DHF, are needed to help elucidate the extent of the protective role of NK cells and the contribution of T cells to disease severity.

These data overwhelming suggested that increased cytokines in very early infection were related to immunopathogenesis and rapid disease progression, which is consistent with other reports and findings in HBV, HCV and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) infections 5, 6, [25] [26] [27] . Second, we found RDPs had a disparate cytokine profile compared with SDPs. Multiple cytokines in RDPs, including TNF-α , IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α , IL-1ra, IL-10, G-CSF, IFN-γ , IL-4 and IL-17, reached peak value in 4 to 5 weeks after infection, whereas only IP-10 and IL-13 in SPDs did so, and lack of TNF-α in SDPs. Consistent with our results, another report had also shown elevations in IL-10, TNF-α , and IFN-γ in acute HIV infection 3 . IFN-γ is secreted by NK cells, Th1 cells and CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes during active infection. IFN-γ has broad effects on immune activation, proinflammatory responses, and immune modulation 28 . Interesting, we found IL-13 in SDP reached peak value at much earlier time than RDPs. An in vitro study had shown that IL-13 decreased TNF-α secreting and modulated monocytes towards supporting Ag-specific cell medicated responses 29 . These data suggested that the rapid increased IL-13 in SDPs might play a role in augmenting Ag-specific cell medicated responses and be related to slow disease progression. Consistent with other reports on ""cytokine storms"" during AHI 2 , we found an ordered sequence of increased cytokines during the acute stage in RDP. The first rapid and transient elevations in TNF-α , IFN-γ , IL-4, IL-8, G-CSF, and IP-10 were at 2 weeks after detection of peak viral load and declined in parallel with the decrease of viral replication, which suggested that the virus directly or indirectly drives the production of cytokine. Rapid and more-sustained elevations in IL-1ra, MIP-1α , IL-5, IL-10 and IL-17 levels were followed by IL-1β , IL-2, IL-7, IL-9, IL-12, IL-15, IFN-α 2, MIP-1β , FGF-2 and GM-CSF at over 2 months post-infection, and accompanied by the recovery of CD4 + cells. A lately increased cytokine IL-6, VEGF and IL-13 were at around 3 months after infection. This complex change on the dynamic of cytokines in RDPs did not happen in SDPs, who had much delayed and milder changes in plasma cytokines. These data suggested that vigorous cytokines storm in RDPs very early after infection reflected the battle between virus replication and host immune response, and resulted in immunopathogenesis and rapid disease progression 30, 31 .",29.52266436786682,13.276887473363983

Experimental studies in mice have shown that the innate immune response is important for clearing a primary dengue infection, whereas the adaptive immune response contributes to the development of severe disease [3, 4] . Other studies have shown that human dengue antibodies can enhance viral growth in vitro and thereby increase the risk of developing severe disease in a secondary infection with a heterologous serotype [5, 6] . Further studies have shown that memory T-cells established during a primary infection may act to increase the risk of developing severe disease in a heterologous secondary infection through increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production [7, 8] . Complementing these experimental studies, epidemiological studies have successfully isolated host and viral risk factors associated with severe disease [9] [10] [11] [12] . Taken together, these studies have indicated that excessive activation of the immune response during a dengue infection may lead to a cascade of cytokine production, known as a cytokine storm, that results in direct damage to vascular endothelial cells and increased capillary permeability [7, 13, 14] .

This will allow to develop appropriate control measures for nosocomial infection containment. Moreover, in many cases respiratory viruses pave the way to severe secondary bacterial infections.

Because our current model does not explicitly include the dynamics of the humoral immune response, we may be oversimplifying the contribution of antibodies to disease severity. Furthermore, a dynamic adaptive immune response needs to be modelled to understand, for example, the downstream effects of the antibody response in modulating cytokine production (intrinsic ADE) [77] .

Conversely, while both human and animal model studies of the host immune response to infection have identified correlates of severe disease, the contribution of host genetics to these correlates and to variability in susceptibility remains relatively unknown. Identification of host genetic polymorphisms contributing to altered susceptibility or disease severity has several benefits: identification of high-risk populations at greater need of prophylactic intervention, elucidation of host proteins important in virus-host interactions, and new targets for therapeutic interventions or vaccine development [1] . Studies of host genetics have provided important contributions to the study of other infectious diseases, including HIV, SARS, and HCV.

Simultaneously, this process induces the robust proliferation of naïve T cells and the host response to compensate for the severe exhaustion of naïve CD4 + T cells (Fig. 7b) . However, the persistent immune activation and lack of immune regulation in old ChRM eventually leads to increased immunosenescence and accelerated disease progression that first prompts these events. In conclusion, aging results in increased disease severity after SIV infection, even before the chronic phase. In addition, old ChRM may serve as an excellent Model of immunosenescence, disease progression and host response in ChRM that demonstrates their variation differences during early SIV infection as detailed in the text. Immunosenescence is shown by the numbers of naïve CD4 + T cells and the percentage of Ki67 + naïve T cells. The plasma viral loads and CD4 + T cell numbers represent the level of disease progression.

Much of the current literature has focused on viral genetics and its impact on host immunity as well as novel risk factors for severe infection (particularly within the H1N1 pandemic). An understanding of the host genetic determinants of susceptibility and severe respiratory illness, however, is currently lacking. By better defining the role of genetic variability in influenza infection and identifying key polymorphisms that impair the host immune response or correlate with protection, we will be able to better identify at-risk populations and new targets for therapeutic interventions and vaccines.

A delicate and important challenge of implementing protocols, care bundles, and checklists into clinical practice in ICUs in resourcelimited settings is the lack of safety data. Different disease pathologies, as well as absent treatment options (e.g., airway protection and mechanical ventilation), could well explain why certain interventions that were shown to improve patient outcome in resource-rich settings increased morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings [215, [245] [246] [247] . This underlines the urgent need to test the efficacy and safety of adjusted care bundles and protocols to improve care of critically ill and sepsis patients in settings where resources are constrained [215, 248] .

Our research on chemokines and chemokine receptors has revealed important roles for these molecules in orchestrating CNS inflammation in response to JHMV infection. We and others have found unique and pleiotropic roles for ELR+ chemokine signaling via CXCR2 in moderating neutrophil infiltration and protecting oligodendroglia from apoptosis in response to exposure to virus and proinflammatory cytokines. Ongoing research in our laboratory continues to focus on the role of ELR(+) chemokine signaling on oligodendroglia during JHMV-induced neuroinflammation.,31.055566374355713,12.489508767289873

Consequently, these biomarkers are probably related to liver fibrosis. They can reflect the immune response or inflammatory environment that is present during the disease. It is important to emphasize that, even though we have detected biomarkers that can be used to stage liver fibrosis in mono-and co-infected individuals, we cannot affirm that these biomarkers are specific for HCV-induced fibrosis. In order to establish specificity, we will need to validate our algorithms with non-HCV liver anomalies such as alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B-induced fibrosis or HCC. It is very likely that several of our candidate biomarkers are 'general' markers for liver damage since most are liverderived and some have already been found in liver infection [21] . In addition, we observed 5 biomarkers that were present in both mono and co-infection and had a good correlation between them. This leads us to believe that there is a potential to identify biomarkers that would be able to diagnose fibrosis independent of HIV infection status. ",29.55580961341715,12.260387824696993

Because they are associated with the up-regulation of MYD88, IRF7, IRF9, STAT1 and STAT2, these genes can activate signaling cascades and lead to the activation of the NF-κB and IFN-I responses [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . However, the highly significant defect in the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production in monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and in the pDC-induced functional activity of CD8 + T cells observed in the elderly may result from decreased TLR surface expression and dysfunctional IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) [49] [50] [51] . Thus, integrating the contradictory findings, we suspect that immunosenescence contributes to the sensitivity to SIVmac239 and causes a high level of viral replication, which in turn elevates the host response and immune activation and ultimately accelerates disease progression in old ChRM. However, to make the best use of PBMC resources, we selected only the 6 old macaques with higher PBMC numbers and compared their gene expression levels with those in the 6 young animals. Therefore, our study may only partially reflect the relationships between gene expression and other parameters. Moreover, the T cell-specific chemokine RANTES, which plays an important role in sustaining CD8 T cell responses 52 , is markedly induced in old ChRM and associates with the homeostatic proliferation of T cells. Thus, it may be an effective marker for disease progression in old patients infected with HIV.",29.072731548419004,12.040659815922023

The tissue remodeling that ensues is characterized by severe inflammation (evident from edema and leukocyte migration) and a delayed phase with fibroblast proliferation and excess matrix deposition [1] . The pathological events leading to pulmonary fibrosis have been attributed to an overproduction of interstitial collagens by cytokine-activated fibroblasts [2] ; moreover, though a variety of cytokines have been implicated in fibroblast activation, a paramount causative role for transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 has emerged. This cytokine activates fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts [3] and stimulates extracellular matrix (ECM) production [4] . However, besides its pro-fibrotic properties, TGF-β1 exerts a number of other homeostatic functions in immune and cancer biology [5] , so that inhibition of TGF-β1 would provoke a series of adverse effects, making it not that valuable as a therapeutic approach.

In contrast to a recent report showing an association between the presence of the D allele of the ACE gene and hypoxemia in SARS patients [10] , we have shown that the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with neither increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection nor progression to ARDS once infected. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we have identified that age is the only significant factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independently associated with the requirement of intensive care in SARS There are several possible explanations for the discrepancies in our conclusion and that by Itoyama et al [10] concerning the association between ACE polymorphism and the outcome of SARS. First, the inclusion of subjects within the same family and exclusion of deceased patients by the previous study might cause potential bias, especially when the frequency of the DD genotype was reported to be as low as 6% in control subjects [10] . In this study, we have only included the index patient if more than one member in a family developed SARS. Second, we have used a well defined endpoint of ARDS instead of the requirement of supplemental oxygen. SARS infection commonly leads to respiratory distress and over 80% of patients were given supplemental oxygen during the course of their illness in our cohort. Therefore, it seems to be more appropriate to use ARDS instead of the requirement of oxygen supplement to define the severity of SARS. As ARDS is the more severe end of the spectrum of disease progression, any potential association between genotype and disease progression would become even more obvious when the most severe cases were considered. Similarly, the disease outcome was not associated with ACE I/ D genotype when we also used another broader definition for severe disease after SARS infection (requiring intensive care or death).",29.906153424084717,11.7790139826389

Global pandemic concerns stem from their high mortality rates, capacity for human-to-human spread by respiratory transmission, and complete lack of approved therapeutic countermeasures. Limiting disease may require the development of virus-directed and host-directed therapeutic strategies due to the acute etiology of hCoV infections. Therefore, understanding how hCoV-host interactions cause pathogenic outcomes relies upon mammalian models that closely recapitulate the pathogenesis of hCoVs in humans. Pragmatism has largely been the driving force underpinning mice as highly effective mammalian models for elucidating hCoV-host interactions that govern pathogenesis. Notably, tractable mouse genetics combined with hCoV reverse genetic systems has afforded the concomitant manipulation of virus and host genetics to evaluate virus-host interaction networks in disease. In addition to assessing etiologies of known hCoVs, mouse models have clinically predictive value as tools to appraise potential disease phenotypes associated with pre-emergent CoVs.

The left side of the parabola, shaded in green and labeled weak, depicts the original circa 1999 concept that C. neoformans was a class 2 pathogen that caused damage in the setting of a weak or normal immune response. Here, the immune response fails to limit fungal growth, which results in host damage. The right side of the parabola, shaded in red and labeled strong, depicts information that has emerged since 1999, which has revealed that C. neoformans can elicit strong immune responses that produce host damage stemming from inflammation. The portion of the parabola that rises above the black dotted line represents the threshold for clinical disease. The portion of the parabola that lies below the black dotted line represents the state of C. neoformans latency, which is not associated with clinically evident host damage.

Serum was collected and frozen at 280uC until the completion of the study. All sera were c-irradiated to facilitate removal from the BSL4 laboratory. Sera was diluted and assayed using a NiV G-specific microsphere assay described previously [17, 37] .

Serum m102. detected at any time in this animal, with the exception of an extremely low level viremia 3 dpi. These findings suggest that the combination of an initial high level of antibody and subsequent longevity may provide protection. For the remaining ferrets, higher levels of m102.4 on day 3 post-challenge correlated with protection from disease whereas levels thereafter did not, potentially highlighting the first 3 days following infection as an important therapeutic window. On day 3, lower m102.4 concentrations in the pre-group may not have been sufficient to neutralize all virus, allowing the initiation of infection. In the postgroup the higher concentrations 3 dpi may have sufficiently neutralized enough virus and/or prevented widespread dissemination of virus, providing a window for the animal to mount an effective immune response. In the post-challenge group, the host immune system may have had an opportunity (10 hrs) to initiate a primary response before antibody-mediated depletion of virus. In the pre-challenge group, the antibody-virus complexes most likely formed almost immediately following challenge and the primary or innate response may have been dampened. As m102.4 levels decreased over time and virus replication initiated, the postchallenge group may have had a more potent secondary response allowing survival. Indeed, the animals in the pre-challenge group developed severe disease 7 days after m102.4 levels decreased, a timeline similar to the disease progression in naive animals. Whether primary or secondary, the antibody responses in the postchallenge group appeared earlier (10 dpi) and were more robust.",27.762280412646945,12.360090058889474

Our rationale for using the JHMV model of acute encephalomyelitis and demyelination to assess the therapeutic benefit of FTY720 is based on the fact that the overwhelming majority of preclinical animal models examining the mode of action for FTY720 is derived from EAE, yet how this drug affects models of viral-induced CNS disease are not well characterized. In addition, viral infections have long been thought to have a role in either initiating or contributing to relapse in MS patients [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] 62] . How treatment with FTY720 influences outcomes in response to viral infection is highlighted by recent clinical studies detailing the emergence of herpes zoster and associated neurologic complications in MS patients during FTY720 treatment [63, 64] . These findings suggest immunosuppression may arise in response to FTY720 treatment resulting in re-emergence of persistent viruses. However, administration of FTY720 to mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis did not ameliorate persistence, indicating that the outcome may be dictated, in part, by the virus and sites of infection [65] . Related to these observations are studies demonstrating that treatment with FTY720 or other S1P1 agonists dramatically affects cytokine production and disease outcome in mice infected with influenza virus, indicating the immunomodulatory effects of such treatment [66] . With regards to viral models of demyelination, Pachner and colleagues [67] demonstrated that administration of FTY720 had no effect on clinical disease progression or viral load within the CNS using Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus model of demyelination. These findings are in contrast with findings using EAE, in which FTY720 treatment reduced clinical disease severity accompanied by limited infiltration of immune cells into the CNS [13] [14] [15] 68, 69] .",28.955546481436343,11.595537415205486

RV-C infection, of itself, is more important than the level of viral replication in determining the clinical illness, as factors other than viral load drive clinical course. RV-C-associated respiratory wheeze in hospitalised children is characterised by a dominant Th2-type inflammatory response and suggests a synergistic relationship between RV-C and host factors in the genesis of wheeze. Furthermore, RV-C promotes a more intense cytokine response in children with asthma compared to children without asthma. The induction of Th17 cytokines that mediate recruitment and activation of neutrophils may be an important underlying pathogenic mechanism associated with RV-C disease in children with pre-existing asthma.

DMD is the most prevalent and severe form of childhood muscle wasting with a cited incidence of 1 in 3,500 live-male births, whereas BMD is a clinically milder form of the disease with slower disease progression [1, 2] . BMD mutations may present with a spectrum of phenotypes, depending upon the nature and location of the DMD lesion, as BMD mutations do not usually disrupt the reading frame, thereby allowing production of an internally shortened but functional dystrophin. BMD patients remain ambulant until at least 16 years of age but, in some mild or asymptomatic cases, may only be diagnosed by accident or late in life [3, 4] . Conversely, intermediate muscular dystrophy has been used to describe ""mildly affected"" DMD patients (those whose genetic structure would predict prematurely truncated dystrophin and loss of ambulation by 12 years of age) or ""severely affected"" BMD cases (those who would be expected to produce some functional dystrophin and therefore remain ambulant after 16 years of age). In 1989, Dubowitz stated that 'Intermediate DMD patients are defined as patients with a dystrophinopathy with onset of symptoms (of motor difficulties) by about 5 years of age, similar to the classical DMD patients but with a slower rate of disease progression, with loss of ambulation between 13 and 16 years of age."" [5] . Children of the same age vary widely in clinical presentation, and patients that appear to have a milder dystrophinopathy have also been termed ""outliers."" [6] In over 90% of DMD cases, correlation between the disease phenotype and the genotype is obvious. However, there are exceptions to the reading frame rule, where an in-frame deletion may result in a severe phenotype, or conversely, some out-of-frame gene rearrangements or nonsense mutations present with relatively mild symptoms, consistent with a diagnosis of BMD [7, 8] .",27.841809236326245,11.563511436344633

The authors concluded that an exaggerated non-nAb response during the early stage of infection was associated with severe disease [90] . Moreover, the authors speculated that non-nAbs present in patients' sera during the early stage of infection were likely to be either preexisting or the result of a secondary heterosubtypic humoral immune response against more conserved epitopes on several influenza proteins [91] . This early humoral response can be elicited within a few days after infection, because of immune priming by previous exposure to shared viral epitopes. In fact, the matrix proteins and nucleoprotein have conserved aminoacid sequences, and therefore Abs against these proteins from previous seasonal influenza virus infection or vaccination could be induced [92] . Indeed, upon infection with influenza virus, memory B-cells can proliferate rapidly and generate a large amount of these high avidity non-nAbs, especially in patients with severe disease.

A non-controlled regulation of these processes may lead to either an unrestricted pathogen spreading or, on the other extreme, to an overshooting inflammatory response, including the increased production of pro-inflammatory and proapoptotic mediators, elevated levels of recruited immune cells, and/or aberrant repair processes. Notably, both too low and too high levels of IFN-induced effects facilitate disease progression with a possible increase of fatal outcomes in ARDS patients (78) . Accordingly, preclinical in vivo studies of IFN-directed therapies yielded seemingly adverse results, depending on the context, timing, and dosage of IFN modulation. However, in multiple settings of acute respiratory viral infection, studies demonstrate that an exaggerated signaling derived from type I IFN in an already inflamed tissue contributes to worsened outcomes, and importantly, might favor secondary bacterial superinfection [e.g., Ref. (75, 76, 209) ]. Interestingly, Davidson et al. (209) demonstrated that type III IFN release upon influenza challenge-in contrast to type I IFN induction-does not trigger an unbalanced inflammatory response that critically contributes to respiratory disease progression in vivo, highlighting it as a possible therapeutic option in IAV-induced lung injury. Most likely, this effect derives from the lack of the IFN-λR1/IL-10R2 receptor complex, but presence of IFNAR, on immune cells, including bone marrowderived macrophages. Nonetheless, other reports identify IFN-λ as a driver of macrophage polarization to an inflammatory M1 phenotype (41) that has been attributed to further promote an overshooting inflammatory response, highlighting the need for further studies of type III IFN biology in pathogen-associated disease progression.",25.87254072270476,9.730766511605074

This contrasted with a single reported Asian analysis from China where 148 patients were assessed [127] . Again, four different groups were identified but the only commonality was a severe group with post-infective bronchiectasis and the presence of airway Pseudomonas. Other key groups from the Chinese study included mild idiopathic disease in young patients, severe idiopathic disease of late-onset and moderate disease in the elderly. A third study focused solely on the Spanish national database of 468 patients again identified the presence of airway Pseudomonas as a separate clinical phenotype [30] .

Moreover, considering environmental factors (such as physiological stress, diet), ethnic group and gender discriminations are important factors in the comorbidity analysis. Our network approach could be extended as a comorbidity map by integrating diet, exercise and other factors as in [74] .",29.30851494311772,12.08323290014087

Other studies have also demonstrated that chest radiographs may have value in monitoring the progression of CF lung disease [18] . Spirometry is a less sensitive marker of structural damage in mild disease [19] ; thus, particularly in young children, it may be that abnormalities in spirometry will only become apparent after longer follow up times. This may explain why the number of exacerbations was associated with worse chest x-ray scores but not with spirometry values. A potentially more sensitive marker of lung disease, lung clearance index (LCI) has been compared to spirometry including FEV1 in several studies. Abnormalities in LCI are detected earlier than abnormalities in FEV 1 [20] [21] [22] [23] . Worsening LCI measurements over time have been shown in young children with CF compared to healthy controls, whereas, no difference in the rate of decline in FEV 1 compared to healthy controls was found [24] .

Here, we sought to specifically address how the kinetics of the host responses to the different viral infections differs, and how this kinetics is related to the outcome of infection. To address this, we used a systems biology approach to analyze this dataset, and we developed a new geometrical representation method and two criteriathe magnitude and velocity coefficientsto visualize and quantify the kinetics of the host response to the different viral infections. Using this approach, we have established that it is the magnitude and velocity of the early host response, rather than engagement of specific biological pathways per se, which mainly contributes to the observed pathogenicity of influenza viruses. Importantly, we show that the molecular kinetic of the host response was associated with clinical disease severity and virus replication.",28.56450990631126,11.385832391459543

An anticipated or a delayed onset of the disease may be caused by various combinations of intrinsic and exogenous factors converging into common pathogenic pathways that underlie different susceptibility to ALS and eventually lead to a different prognosis. Here we report the identification of protein biomarkers in PBMC that can discriminate ALS patients with an early disease onset from those with a late disease onset. The identified phenotypic biomarkers have in common a high expression in CNS where they have an important role in protein folding, as foldases and/or classical molecular chaperones, and are upregulated by a variety of stressors. They participate at different levels and in different ways in the maintenance of proteostasis, whose deficit has shown to generate protein misfolding and aggregation and facilitate the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS (Ruegsegger and Saxena, 2016) . These phenotypic biomarkers are: PPIA, HSP90, GRP78, and DJ-1. Polyclonal anti-peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression in neurons and motor neurons (Lauranzano et al., 2015) . It is a peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase and, as a foldase, it accelerates the ratelimiting steps along the folding pathway, but it also acts as a classical molecular chaperone (Fischer et al., 1989; Freskgard et al., 1992) . We originally identified it as a candidate protein biomarker in PBMC of ALS patients with classical disease onset, where it is upregulated also in association with disease progression (Nardo et al., 2011) . We next found that mutant SOD1 and TDP-43 are substrates of PPIA (Lauranzano et al., 2015) . In fact, in absence of PPIA increased levels of mutant SOD1 and TDP-43 were recovered in the aggregates isolated from the spinal cord of SOD1 G93A mice that had also an anticipation of the onset and an acceleration of the disease progression.",27.914091743956817,13.48290436990637

On the diagnostic level, studies are needed to identify the most appropriate diagnostic test and specimen from the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The detection of CARVs in peripheral blood has been associated with significant LRTID, disseminated disease, and poor outcome, but requires evaluation by specifically designed studies. There is interest to identify and confirm risk factors of severe disease and poor outcome and to evaluate laboratory markers of virus-specific immunity as surrogate markers of disease and recovery. The recent attempts to use RSV loads as a virological surrogate marker of antiviral treatment by small interfering RNA and/or clinical outcome may have a pacemaker role for other CARVs [89] . Importantly, the currently available treatments for CARV URTID and LRTID lack rigorous evaluation in appropriately sized, prospective randomized controlled trials. This is needed for comparing aerosolized ribavirin with systemic (oral) ribavirin; for evaluating the role of expensive IVIG preparations in combination with ribavirin; and for determining the use of intravenous monoclonal antibody specific for the RSV-F protein (palivizumab, motavizumab) as postexposure prophylaxis for high-risk patients as well as therapy for RSV URTID and LRTID.

By comparing mRNA expression in individuals infected with an emerging virus to expression in individuals infected with a related established virus, researchers can generate a ''molecular fingerprint'' of the host response genes or pathways specifically involved in the oftenexuberant host responses to the emerging virus. By using genetically engineered influenza A viruses, a role for the nonstructural NS1 viral protein in evasion of the innate host response has been demonstrated [14] . Interestingly, the NS1 protein derived from the 1918 Spanish H1N1 pandemic influenza virus blocked expression of interferon-regulated genes more efficiently than did the NS1 protein from established seasonal influenza viruses [14] . Other genomics studies of genetically engineered influenza A viruses containing some or all of the gene segments from either the 1918 H1N1 virus or the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1), suggest that these highly pathogenic influenza viruses induce severe disease in mice and macaques through aberrant and persistent activation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses [15] [16] [17] [18] . Application of genomics tools not only supports the elucidation of mechanisms underlying pathogenesis but may also help to identify leads for therapeutic intervention. In ferrets, H5N1 infection induced severe disease that was associated with strong expression of interferon response genes including the interferon-cinduced cytokine CXCL10. Treatment of H5N1-infected ferrets with an antagonist of the CXCL10 receptor (CXCR3) reduced the severity of the flu symptoms and the viral titers compared to the controls [19] , clearly demonstrating the potential of biological response modifiers for the clinical management of viral infections.

Thus, in the present investigation, we employed an immunoproteomic approach and pooled human antibodies to detect host-specific response proteins in OSCC patients. Specifically, we used a well-characterized analytical platform combining two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to identify biomarkers in unfractionated sera from OSCC patients and normal controls. This immunoproteomics approach can be used to identify antigens targeted by the immune system in sera during disease progression. In addition, the immune responses are known to be involved in the mechanism of carcinogenesis [13] . Therefore, our comparative analyses revealed distinct OSCC biomarkers that might promote the development of specific diagnostic tests for early detection of oral cancer. 3(09) ]) approve this consent procedure.

The majority of the lung microbiota belongs to the normal flora that play an important role in the pulmonary epithelial integrity, colonization resistance, and homeostasis of the immune system in the respiratory tract (3) . A small fraction of them are, however, potentially pathogenic microorganisms that are involved in a variety of lung diseases, as exemplified by the genus Haemophilus. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that are commonly residing in the human airways. Uniquely and yet unexplained, NTHi is a commensal when colonizing the nasopharynx or throat, but pathogenic in the lower airways triggering a robust inflammatory response [for reviews see (4, 5) ]. NTHi is considered a potential opportunistic pathogen as it frequently infects the lower respiratory tract of lungs with structural damage as a consequence of non-infectious lung diseases or mechanical injuries. Moreover, NTHi occasionally causes bronchitis and pneumonia (6) . In addition, lower airway colonization by NTHi has been associated with disease progression of several more or less non-infectious lung diseases such as bronchiectasis (7), cystic fibrosis (8) , interstitial lung diseases (9, 10) , but mostly in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (11, 12) . COPD is a severe inflammatory lung disease characterized by airflow limitation with a range of pathological changes. Both genetics and environmental factors trigger the onset of COPD, however, microbes including NTHi play an important role in the acute exacerbations. This review describes the disease progression of COPD in the context of host immuneinteractions linked to NTHi, and the overall impact in disease exacerbation.",28.440452035660655,12.88176034861633

It demonstrates that glucocorticoids may be a potential way of altering the changes in the host transcriptome at late time points after infection. If host gene responses are maintained this may increase disease resilience. Given the severe disease that manifested during the SARS-CoV outbreak, many different treatment options were empirically tried on human patients. One immunomodulatory treatment that was tried during the SARS-CoV outbreak was systemic corticosteroids. This was tried with and without the use of type I IFNs and other therapies that could directly target the virus [68] . Retrospective analysis revealed that, when given at the correct time and to the appropriate patients, corticosteroid use could decrease mortality and also length of hospital stays [68] . In addition, there is some evidence that simultaneous treatment with IFNs could increase the potential benefits [69] .

Along with infection, the ferret lungs demonstrate mucus plugging, inflammation, and reduced MCC, all important manifestations of a CF airway. Given this, the ferret could be useful for testing the efficacy of potential therapeutics under conditions of infection and inflammation, which has not been possible with previous CF models.

Several factors influence the clinical outcome of COPD. Importantly, the crosstalk between intrinsic factors (the stability and integrity of the airway immune response and structure in addition to hereditary factors), and the extrinsic factors (lung microbiome, viral and bacterial infections, meteorological factors, and noxious inhalation) determines the fate of lower airway opportunistic infection by H. influenzae. Intriguingly, NTHi has been one of the most isolated pathogens at both stable and exacerbation states of COPD. Such persistent airway colonization of NTHi costs virulence fitness to counteract with the bactericidal effect of the host immune response. Adversely, the impaired defense mechanisms in COPD are not only unable to protect the lung structure from inhaled physical assaults, but they also fail to suppress NTHi infection. The disoriented immune response in COPD instead allows the pathogen to cause more harm and inflammation in the airways. The currently used bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid therapies have limited efficacy in preventing disease progression in COPD. Moreover, the inhaled corticosteroid therapies might have side effects that may weaken the immune response. Hence, more investigations are needed to garner a more adequate knowledge regarding the variabilities in immune networking of COPD. This knowledge will be an important platform for a more efficient drug design. In addition, a vaccine targeting NTHi is another important approach in controlling the infective exacerbations in COPD as the antibiotic treatment is also getting dampened by the emergence of NTHi antibiotic resistance.",29.107253197434073,12.155302060902997

Studying HRSV infection in the lung is complicated by the invasive sampling procedure required to access this organ, particularly in children, where informed consent cannot be directly obtained from the child. Instead proxy tools such as air liquid interface or sampling secretions from the lung provide the next best solution. In the latter case, either nasal swab or nasopharyngeal aspirates will provide indications in the form of cellular proteins that may be associated with infection [16] .

However, we have not found a simple explanation for what TREM2 does across cell types and contexts. Based on its disease progression dependent effects, it does not appear that simply activating or inhibiting TREM2 would be beneficial even in the context of AD. There may also be sex-dependent effects of TREM2, as some [86] but not all [202] have shown differences in sTREM2 levels in CSF between male and female subjects. Likewise, a TREM2 variant was associated with markers of systemic inflammation specifically in women not men, and was hormone-independent [110] . With the lack of strong biomarkers to stage NDDs and the variability in clinical progression among patients, it is not likely that increasing or decreasing TREM2 will be the universal solution to NDD pathologies.",30.119945736831475,12.559828635292368

Specific components of the response to virus, such as viperin and IP-10 and I-TAC have been implicated in dengue infection for the first time. Further investigation of these components, together with the precise role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in virus replication, may lead to drug targets for dengue.

Many studies have focused on how TREM2 and diseaseassociated variants impact AD-related pathologies. Studies examining loss of TREM2 function in amyloid mouse models initially appeared to support contradictory conclusions. Some groups found that TREM2 deficiency reduced [162, 258] while others found that it increased [222] amyloid pathology. However, recent evidence has harmonized these results by demonstrating that TREM2 deficiency has a changing role throughout AD progression, reducing amyloid pathology early but increasing it at later stages of disease [287] . Studies overexpressing TREM2 in AD mouse models also found a temporal effect of this overexpression, which reduced pathology early in disease progression [214] but no effect at a later time point [300] . This is supported by Korvatska and colleagues [60] who demonstrate accelerated disease progression in R47H carriers compared to non-carriers with AD. This may also explain discrepancies in human studies of R47H carriers who found no association between R47H carriers and non-carriers in amyloid deposition [49] and others who found that R47H carriers had significantly more plaques compared with noncarriers [57] . This changing role for TREM2 throughout progression of amyloid pathology may also reflect a dynamic role for myeloid cells themselves. As Hickman and El Khoury [11] posit, these brain myeloid cells may be protective early through clearance of Aβ, but detrimental later in disease progression when they enhance the inflammatory response without being effective phagocytes. Alternatively, it could reflect how TREM2 impacts the phenotype and abundance of distinct myeloid cell subsets, or perhaps other microenvironmental cues which change TREM2 downstream signaling to favor alternative pathways. While mouse models so far have recapitulated several aspects of TREM2 localization and function observed in human brain tissue, it is worth noting that there is a caveat to studying TREM2 in mouse models of AD with PSEN mutations since γ-secretase is also important for TREM2 CTF cleavage [232] . It is not clear whether changes in γ-secretase activity would be likely to greatly alter TREM2 function in vivo, but this should be a consideration when interpreting these studies.",32.37244358657177,12.199524553114488

It was not surprising therefore that, in the multivariate analysis, only the strongest predictor of disease severity is retained. Higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase had previously been found to be one of the best correlates of severe disease [26] .

The Hu-NSG-SGM3 express certain human cytokines and human leukocytes, however the disease progression is somewhat atypical as the disease is primarily neurological [29] . Both the STAT1 -/and IFNAR -/mice possess complete sets of murine immune systems, but their cells either have altered response to interferon signaling or do not respond to type I interferon signaling, respectively, leading to rapid disease more reminiscent of human hemorrhagic fever [10-12]. IFNAR -/mice are highly susceptible to severe disease caused by several viral agents [11, 12, [30] [31] due to lower and/or altered immune responses to infections compared with wild type mice [32] [33] [34] [35] . The IFNAR -/mice frequently do not respond as quickly to infection as wild type mice and, furthermore, CCHFV replicates to higher levels than in wild type mice [12] . The increased difficulty in protecting IFNAR -/mice from infection seems associated with insufficient immune responses due to inadequate cross-priming of antigen presenting cells [32] . Thus, efficacy testing of vaccines in this model can be difficult as protective vaccines must elicit proper immune responses by circumventing IFNAR -/dampened antigen priming, and must stimulate an effective adaptive immune response that can compensate for the lack of antiviral state activation and reduction of CCHFV replication normally mediated by type I interferon signaling. Therefore, IFNAR -/mice should be considered a ""higher bar"" for efficacy testing of vaccines than fully immunocompetent rodent models.",28.103176447146645,11.300640883383878

More importantly, the pattern of spread of HeV through the brain of mice is best explained by an ability of the virus to employ direct trans-neuronal transmission without concomitant generation of an infectious virion: these observations are of key pathogenetic significance to the human disease. Not only do they provide a possible explanation for failure to reisolate HeV from both sub-acute (I. Smith, unpublished data) and recrudescent [38] human cases of HeV using conventional techniques and in whom there was ample evidence of its ongoing replication, they raise important challenges to optimizing therapeutic interventions.

Severe cases of H1N1pdm infection are characterized by prolonged activation of the immune response, yet the specific role of inflammatory mediators in disease is poorly understood. The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been implicated in both seasonal and severe pandemic H1N1 influenza A (H1N1pdm) infection. Here, we investigated the role of IL-6 in severe H1N1pdm infection. We found IL-6 to be an important feature of the host response in both humans and mice infected with H1N1pdm. Elevated levels of IL-6 were associated with severe disease in patients hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection. Notably, serum IL-6 levels associated strongly with the requirement of critical care admission and were predictive of fatal outcome. In C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice, infection with A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm) consistently triggered severe disease and increased IL-6 levels in both lung and serum. Furthermore, in our lethal C57BL/6J mouse model of H1N1pdm infection, global gene expression analysis indicated a pronounced IL-6 associated inflammatory response. Subsequently, we examined disease and outcome in IL-6 deficient mice infected with H1N1pdm. No significant differences in survival, weight loss, viral load, or pathology were observed between IL-6 deficient and wild-type mice following infection.

The advent of new imaging and ""omic"" technologies has provided the ability to follow these interactions from whole animal to cellular and molecular levels, enabling a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved; this facilitates the development and refinement of new and existing vaccines and therapeutics. For example, advances in bioimaging provide a noninvasive means of identifying the internal systemic spread of infection in animal models and the impact of a prophylaxis or a therapy on the disease process. This can be combined with the analysis of responses at a cellular level using flow cytometry and microscopy techniques. The use of microarrays has also enhanced our understanding of the host response to infection and provides supportive information to help elucidate the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms essential for protection against pathogens, as well as the virulence mechanisms deployed by the pathogen. Although in its infancy, next generation sequencing also holds great potential for defining host-pathogen interactions. This review will assess the impact of these technologies on the ability to assess the host response and how this has been applied to help progress the development of vaccines and immunotherapies against biodefence agents described in the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) Select Agent list (http://www.selectagents.gov/).

Given the diverse functional roles of PTX3 as well as its ability to bind to a variety of immune factors, further study is required to define the exact PTX3-triggered immune pathways induced in alphaviral-induced arthritic diseases. Identification of such pathways will be an important step towards the future development of therapeutic interventions.",29.27756006694512,10.861404087015359

Infections are a major complication of cancer and its treatment. Community acquired respiratory viral infections (CRV) in these patients increase morbidity, mortality and can lead to delay in chemotherapy. These are the result of infections with a heterogeneous group of viruses including RNA viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (RhV), and coronavirus (CoV). These infections maintain a similar seasonal pattern to those of immunocompetent patients. Clinical manifestations vary significantly depending on the type of virus and the type and degree of immunosuppression, ranging from asymptomatic or mild disease to rapidly progressive fatal pneumonia Infections in this population are characterized by a high rate of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infection and prolonged viral shedding. Use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy are risk factors for severe disease. The clinical course is often difficult to predict, and clinical signs are unreliable. Accurate prognostic viral and immune markers, which have become part of the standard of care for systemic viral infections, are currently lacking; and management of CRV infections remains controversial. Defining effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies is challenging, especially considering, the spectrum of immunocompromised patients, the variety of respiratory viruses, and the presence of other opportunistic infections and medical problems. Prevention remains one of the most important strategies against these viruses. Early diagnosis, supportive care and antivirals at an early stage, when available and indicated, have proven beneficial. However, with the exception of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza infection, there are no accepted treatments. In high-risk patients, pre-emptive treatment with antivirals for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) to decrease progression to LRTI is a common strategy.

Front,"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are extremely common especially in the first year of life. Knowledge of the etiology of a RTI is essential to facilitate the appropriate management and the implementation of the most effective control measures. This perspective explains why laboratory methods that can identify pathogens in respiratory secretions have been developed over the course of many years. High-complexity multiplex panel assays that can simultaneously detect up to 20 viruses and up to four bacteria within a few hours have been marketed. However, are these platforms actually useful in pediatric clinical practice? In this manuscript, we showed that these platforms appear to be particularly important for epidemiological studies and clinical research. On the contrary, their routine use in pediatric clinical practice remains debatable. They can be used only in the hospital as they require specific equipment and laboratory technicians with considerable knowledge, training, and experience. Moreover, despite more sensitive and specific than other tests routinely used for respiratory pathogen identification, they do not offer significantly advantage for detection of the true etiology of a respiratory disease. Furthermore, knowledge of which virus is the cause of a respiratory disease is not useful from a therapeutic point of view unless influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus are the infecting agents as effective drugs are available only for these pathogens. On the other hand, multiplex platforms can be justified in the presence of severe clinical manifestations, and in immunocompromised patients for whom specific treatment option can be available, particularly when they can be used simultaneously with platforms that allow identification of antimicrobial resistance to commonly used drugs. It is highly likely that these platforms, particularly those with high sensitivity and specificity and with low turnaround time, will become essential when new drugs effective and safe against most of the respiratory viruses will be available.

Previous serological studies report serum-resident antibodies against tumor cells in melanoma patients, with some evidence that serum antibodies are diminished in patients with advanced disease [25, 47] . It was unclear whether this was a consequence of the sequestering of antibodies into tumors with increasing tumor burden in these patients. Our findings provide further insight by demonstrating the presence of a circulating long-term mature B cell response to cancer at all disease stages, against a broad range of naturally expressed antigens on the surface of primary and metastatic tumor cells. We also report decreased frequency of tumorreactive antibody-producing B cells with advanced disease, thus supporting the premise that mechanisms of immune tolerance rather than adsorption of antibodies into tumors in advanced disease setting may also explain these reductions. One limitation may arise from screening for antibodies against mostly metastatic melanoma cells. It is possible that our observations may reflect reactivity to antigens present in primary disease, which may be preserved or upregulated in advanced disease setting. While our findings may not account for reactivity to tumor antigens that are lost with disease progression, this reduced reactivity to melanoma we observed may imply weakened immune responses to a subset of antigens on the surface of melanoma cells. Another explanation for these observations may be that with advanced disease, mature circulating B cells home into increasing tumor sites, thus reducing the circulating tumor-reactive B cell compartment in these patients. Future studies aimed at monitoring local B cell responses in tumors may provide further clues into the dynamics of mature B cell responses at the systemic and local levels in cancer. Thus, despite well-known weakened host immune response with disease progression [48] , we were able to detect melanoma-reactive antibodies from patient circulating B cells, implying that although mature humoral immune responses are weakened, responses in the form of mature memory B cells may persist.

The factors that mitigate the more severe inflammatory host response are still unclear. A study of sera from 57 patients in Hong Kong with H1N1 infection showed that T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 17 (Th17) hypercytokinemia is an early host response in severe 2009 H1N1 cases. A prospective analysis of cytokine and chemokine profiles in sera from 35 patients in Spain with H1N1 infection showed common expression patterns of innate antiviral response proteins across patients with mild illness and those with more severe presentations. All 35 subjects with H1N1 infection showed increased expression of chemokines CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL4. These chemokines are also upregulated in SARS CoV, H5N1, and RSV infection and are markers for innate immune response to viral infections. The authors compared the serum cytokine profiles of infected outpatients with those of patients with noncritical respiratory insufficiency admitted to the hospital, and critically ill patients with respiratory insufficiency. Patients with respiratory compromise had increased levels of Th1 and Th17 cytokines when compared with healthy individuals and outpatient controls. Critically ill patients had elevated serum levels of IL-15, IL-12p70, and IL-6. These proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the adaptive immune response and may represent the pathological difference between the host response to infection that causes mild illness and those that result in severe systemic inflammatory response. 52 A study of 32 patients in Romania with H1N1, 21 with ARDS and 11 with mild disease, showed that severe influenza A (H1N1) virus infection was characterized by IL-6, IL-15, IL-8, and TNF-α. 53 These cytokines, except TNF-α, had a positive correlation with the admission delay and C-reactive protein, and a negative correlation with the PaO 2 : FiO 2 ratio. Of note, in this study IL-17 levels were not elevated in patients with severe disease.

Furthermore, viral replication should be accompanied by measurable clinical manifestations, and pathology should resemble that of human cases such that a better understanding of the disease process in humans is attained. There is often more than one animal model that closely represents human disease for a given pathogen. Small animal models are typically used for first-line screening, and for initially testing the efficacy of vaccines or therapeutics.

Recent advances in genomics-based tools have allowed more sophisticated understanding of interactions among genes and genetic pathways, the environment, and the host and its pathogens. Already, it is apparent that genomics tools have started to change the practice of medicine. For example, they have been used to assess prognosis and guide therapy in several forms of cancer, to stratify patients according to risk of long-QT syndrome, and to shed light on the response to certain drugs, such as antiepileptic agents (Priori et al., 2003; Siddiqui et al., 2003; Van de Vijver et al., 2002) . Our understanding of how living organisms and systems within organisms interact with each other and respond to the environment all changes dramatically in this genomic era. Full benefit from genomics tools in combating viral diseases requires understanding the dynamics of infection with regard to viral diversity, evolution, and epidemiology, in combination with a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the infection and the molecular basis of the host response to infection. In this chapter, we describe how genomics may aid in mitigating viral threats, by highlighting potential roles and limitations of genomics approaches in surveillance and diagnostics, and development of vaccines and antivirals (Figure 97 .2). As the clinical outcome of an infectious disease depends on properties of both the pathogen and the host, a distinction is made between viral genomics and host genomics.",30.55090265715307,12.63228797947829

Early diagnosis of degenerative diseases is important in initiating symptomatic treatment, and will be of even greater significance if drugs with a potential to slow down the degenerative process prove to have a clinical effect with the use of specific CSF markers. Discrimination of AD from controls and from other neurological diseases has been improved by simultaneous analysis of beta-amyloid (1-42), total-tau, and phosphorylated tau, where a combination of low levels of CSF-beta-amyloid 1-42 and high levels of CSF-tau and CSF-phospho-tau is associated with an AD diagnosis [335] [336] [337] .

Other studies in mice and macaques with genetically engineered influenza viruses containing gene segments from the 1918 H1N1 virus or the pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A virus suggest that highly pathogenic influenza viruses induce severe disease through aberrant and persistent activation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses (Baskin et al., 2009; Kash et al., 2004 Kash et al., , 2006 Kobasa et al., 2007) . In ferrets, it was shown that infection with H5N1 influenza A virus induced severe disease, with strong expression of CXCL10, among others. Treatment with an antagonist of the CXCL10 receptor reduced the severity of symptoms and viral titers compared to control animals (Cameron et al., 2008) .

Primary prevention occurs at the predisease phase and aims to protect populations, so that infection and disease never occur. For example, measles immunization campaigns aim to decrease susceptibility following exposure. The goal of secondary prevention is to halt the progress of an infection during its early, often asymptomatic stages so as to prevent disease development or limit its severity; steps important for not only improving the prognosis of individual cases but also preventing infectious agent transmission. For example, interventions for secondary prevention of hepatitis C in injection drug user populations include early diagnosis and treatment by active surveillance and screening (Miller and Dillon, 2015) . Tertiary prevention focuses on diseased individuals with the objective of limiting impact through, for example, interventions that decrease disease progression, increase functionality, and maximize quality of life. Broadly, public health efforts to control infectious diseases focus on primary and secondary prevention activities that reduce the potential for exposure to an infectious agent and increase host resistance to infection. The objective of these activities can extend beyond disease control, as defined by the 1997 Dahlem Workshop on the Eradication of Infectious Diseases, to reach objectives of elimination and eradication (Dowdle, 1998 ; Box 1). As noted earlier, the causation and spread of an infectious disease is determined by the interplay between agent, host, and environmental factors. For any infectious disease, this interplay requires a specific linked sequence of events termed the chain of infection or chain of transmission ( Figure 6 ). The chain starts with the infectious agent residing and multiplying in some natural reservoir; a human, animal, or part of the environment such as soil or water that supports the existence of the infectious agent in nature. The infectious agent leaves the reservoir via a portal of exit and, using some mode of transmission, moves to reach a portal of entry into a susceptible host. A thorough understanding of the chain of infection is crucial for the prevention and control of any infectious disease, as breaking a link anywhere along the chain will stop transmission of the infectious agent. Often more than one intervention can be effective in controlling a disease, and the approach selected will depend on multiple factors such as economics and ease with which an intervention can be executed in a given setting. It is important to realize that the potential for rapid and far-reaching movement of infectious agents that has accompanied globalization means that coordination of intervention activities within and between nations is required for optimal prevention and control of certain diseases.",26.48450911602999,12.063886519239036

Thus, consensus definitions for sepsis in term and preterm infants are needed so that future epidemiologic studies and trials of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions can be interpreted and implemented.

MLL is member of the Núcleo Milenio en Inmunología e Inmunoterapia. Research on host and viral factors associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, disease progression, and response to antiretroviral therapy has proved critical for designing efficient interventions. HIV entry into cells results from complex interactions between env gp120 with CD4 and co-receptors. CCR5, the major receptor for cytokines, is also the main co-receptor for macrophage-tropic R5 strains. The CCR5-delta32 homozygous deletion and the CCR5-m303 variant, have been associated with resistance to HIV infection, and CCR5-delta32 heterozygosity with delayed disease progression. Also, the minor co-receptor CCR2 64I variant has been associated with delayed progression. The effect on progression of SDF1 polymorphisms, a ligand for the chemokine receptor CXCR4, remains controversial. With regards to innate or specific host immune response to HIV, while there are conflicting results on the role of neutralizing antibodies, studies have shown an association between HLA class I alleles and natural resistance to infection or disease progression. Discordance between maternal and infant HLA genotypes may have a protective effect. Response to antiretroviral drugs involves both host genetics and HIV variation. While the ability of HIV to mutate and escape drug pressure varies with each drug's specific mechanism of action, human polymorphisms have been associated with increased toxicity of some antiretroviral drugs. Until today, the challenge has been to demonstrate the clinical significance of identified polymorphism following a pathogenesis hypothesis driven approach (gene/pathway candidates). Following completion of the human genome sequencing, numerous SNPs have been identified whose biological significance remains unknown, and the challenge is to discover associations between such SNPs and characterized phenotypes. Understanding a polymorphism functional significance becomes the next step. Discordant couples, transmitting mothers/partners, rapid progressors under therapy or long term untreated non-progressors are phenotypes which have been widely used.

Monitoring disease activity in chronically HBV-infected patients is best done by measuring aminotransferase (ALT) at regular intervals in HBeAg-positive patients. However, serial HBV DNA testing is recommended in HBeAg-negative patients. The determination of serum HBV DNA (viral load) is important in the pretreatment evaluation and monitoring of therapeutic response in patients with chronic infection. 73 Currently, therapy for chronic HBV infection does not eradicate the virus and has limited long-term efficacy. The decision to treat should be based on ALT elevations; the presence of HBeAg or HBV DNA (or both); viral load of greater than 2000 IU/mL; the presence of moderate disease activity and fibrosis on liver biopsy; and virologic testing to exclude concurrent infections with hepatitis D virus (HDV), HCV, and HIV. The treatment goals for chronic hepatitis B are to achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and to prevent further progression of liver disease. Parameters used to indicate treatment response include normalization of serum ALT, decrease in serum HBV DNA, and loss of HBeAg with or without detection of anti-HBeAg. Currently, there are eight FDA-approved therapies for chronic HBV infection: IFN-a, pegylated IFN-a2a, four nucleoside analogs (lamivudine, telbivudine, entecavir, and emtricitabine), and two nucleotide analogs (adefovir and tenofovir). Several factors predict a favorable response to IFN treatment with the most important being high ALT and low serum HBV DNA viral load, which are indirect markers of immune clearance.",33.13809813146692,13.24028581162011

Administration of neutralizing antibodies early in disease onset when patients were infected with respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV and influenza A virus was reported to be beneficial (Mair-Jenkins et al., 2014) . Treatment of SARS-CoV-infected patients with convalescent plasma early in disease progression resulted in a higher likelihood of disease remission and survival (Cheng et al., 2005) and administering convalescent plasma in two SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers resulted in complete recovery (Yeh et al., 2005) .

This complicated system of serologic markers is used for diagnosis of HBV infection and to define the phase of infection, degree of infectivity, prognosis, and patient's immune status. The presence of HBV DNA in the serum is a marker of viral replication in the liver and has replaced hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) as the most sensitive marker of viral replication. HBeAg is the extracellular form of the hepatitis B core protein. Molecular assays to quantify blood HBV DNA are useful for the initial evaluation of HBV infections, monitoring of patients with chronic infections, and assessing the efficacy of antiviral treatment. 71, 73 In addition, U.S. blood donors are routinely screened for HBV DNA by qualitative tests to detect donors in the early stage of infection. 74 Antiviral resistance mutations are detected by molecular methods that identify known mutations associated with drug resistance.",30.834379118701072,12.34924054414738

For instance, models could predict: the chance that a disease will invade particular countries, the expected number of cases within a particular timeframe, or the expected effect of interventions. For this information to be of value, the model must be a sufficiently accurate representation of reality in order to provide useful outputs. All models have a trade-off between complexity and accuracy so it is important to assess which approach is most appropriate for each individual situation (Keeling and Rohani, 2008) . Often multiple models may be developed to describe the same real-world event; this is a natural consequence of no model being completely accurate. Early in a disease outbreak response, real-world information is sparse. Confidence in model accuracy may be increased if multiple different, independent models, developed by independent research groups, converge on a qualitatively similar output (or they may provide clear insight to the reasons for different qualitative behaviour). For example, Mateus and Otete (2014) found that multiple models offer the same qualitative prediction that travel restrictions will not prevent the spread of influenza into susceptible populations. According to Keeling and Rohani (2008) , a good model should be both suited to its purpose (as simple as possible but no simpler) and parameterizable by available data. Deciding which mathematical methods to use is an important decision for modellers (Fowkes and Mahony, 1994) as evaluation of a model comes down to a subjective measure of usefulness (Keeling and Rohani, 2008) . In some circumstances, for instance when modelling is conducted within the UK government, such decisions are made in discussion with the commissioner of the modelling rather than by the modeller alone. Directed by this view, we seek to identify what modelling techniques have been employed to predict the global spread of a pandemic potential disease and what data are available to parametrise these models. Confidence in model outputs is important as, in the case of disease spread models, health protection planning decisions may be directly influenced by these outputs. Confidence in model outputs can be increased through a process known as validation.",28.664249057993253,11.851543320614828

Autocrine and paracrine signal transduction by bioactive lipids is central to both the activation and resolution of the host inflammatory response. These lipids are synthesized from arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, linoleic, and linolenic acids) via cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 pathway. Their release from membrane phospholipids is tightly regulated by a system of over 50 enzymes. COX-1 and COX-2 are responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which generally exert a strong proinflammatory effect early in the host response. The three LOX enzymes (5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX) synthesize leukotrienes and lipoxins as well as hepoxilins and hydroperoxy and hydroxyl fatty acids. Lipids produced by 5-LOX (LTB 4 , LTC 4 , LTE 4 , 5-HETE) are proinflammatory, acting as chemoattractants for neutrophils and basophils and potently promoting bronchoconstriction, smooth muscle contraction, and increased vascular permeability. In contrast, lipids produced by 12-LOX and 15-LOX (LXA 4 and LXB 4 ) have antiinflammatory activities that are important for resolution of the inflammatory response. Resolvins, protectins, and maresins produced from eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids are also important in limiting infiltration of immune cells and tissue damage at the site of infection and are therefore important for resolution of the inflammatory response.",28.690055163793854,11.105527248216253

Furthermore, this pathologic finding was replicated in a mouse model of chronic inflammation in the lungs induced by repeated instillation of nontypeable H influenzae lysate. 64 Widespread use of high resolution computed tomography scans has revealed that bronchiectasis develops in a substantial proportion of patients with COPD. In a comprehensive study of 92 patients with stable moderate or severe disease, 57.5% had bronchiectasis, and its presence was related to worse lung function, hospital admission in the past year, and chronic bronchitic symptoms. 65 Repeated sputum cultures in these patients linked chronic colonization with potential bacterial pathogens (predominantly nontypeable H influenzae and P aeruginosa) with the presence of bronchiectasis. 65 In summary, these various lines of investigation support the paradigm of a vicious circle of infection and inflammation in COPD.

To investigate whether the pediatric generally accepted definitions for SIRS and sepsis applied to term infants, Hofer and colleagues 10 retrospectively examined 476 term neonates and found that the generally accepted definitions applied to only 53% of cases of culturepositive early-onset sepsis. Neonatal sepsis has been inconsistently defined on the basis of a variety of clinical and laboratory criteria, which makes the study of this condition very difficult. 11 Diagnostic challenges and uncertain disease epidemiology necessarily result from a variable definition of disease.

Advanced age was significantly associated with increased SARS-related deaths, primarily due to the onset of early-and late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis. Infection of aged, but not young, mice with recombinant viruses bearing spike glycoproteins derived from early human or palm civet isolates resulted in death accompanied by pathological changes associated with ARDS. In aged mice, a greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed than in young mice, whose responses were significantly delayed. Differences between lethal and nonlethal virus phenotypes in aged mice could be attributed to differences in host response kinetics rather than virus kinetics. SARS-CoV infection induced a range of interferon, cytokine, and pulmonary wound-healing genes, as well as several genes associated with the onset of ARDS. Mice that died also showed unique transcriptional profiles of immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and stress. Cytokines associated with ARDS were significantly upregulated in animals experiencing lung pathology and lethal disease, while the same animals experienced downregulation of the ACE2 receptor. These data suggest that the magnitude and kinetics of a disproportionately strong host innate immune response contributed to severe respiratory stress and lethality.

Serum markers are useful because they are easily accessed by established and noninvasive standardized collection procedures and serum specimens are near homogeneous. Indeed, serum biomarkers, such as periostin, have been used recently in efforts to predict treatment benefit in patients with asthma [24] . Furthermore, we found that the biomarker spectrum in nasal secretion and serum was not identical, suggesting that both systemic and local specimens need to be examined in an effort to identify best biomarkers for clinical practice and research. We undertook a methodical screening approach using network visualization tool to study serum parameters in CRS exacerbation. Biological parameters can be analyzed by pre-selected variables based on pre acquired, scientific knowledge or by using methods that aid in discovery of patterns in larger sets of data. Conventional analyses employ measurements of central tendency, such as median, mean, or mode, for a limited number of variables, which allows organization and interpretation of data; however, in the process may compress outliers and individual variations, and thus potentially risk missing important clues of information. In contrast, unsupervised simultaneous variable analysis methods allow for the concurrent overview of a high number of variables without compression of information. In particular, certain novel multivariate methods, such as network analysis employ unsupervised learning, allowing the data to reveal patterns without a priori assumptions in comparator classes (e.g., cases and controls) leading to discovery of associations and correlations without preconceived distinctions.

Replication of microorganisms in the subpleural alveoli precipitates an inflammatory response resulting in endothelial injury, increased capillary permeability, and extravasation of pulmonary interstitial fluid into the pleural space. Pleural fluid is infected readily because it lacks opsonins and complement. Bacteria interfere with the host defense mechanism by production of endotoxins and other toxic substances. Anaerobic glycolysis results from further accumulation of neutrophils and bacterial debris. This in turn causes pleural fluid to become purulent and acidic (i.e., empyema).

Much attention has been focused on host correlates of disease progression, such as the strength of HIV-specific immune responses [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] and host genetic polymorphisms that might affect HIV-1 replication [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] . RNA load remains the best predictor of HIV disease progression 83 and the dramatic reductions in this load achieved by ARV treatment can delay disease progression 84 . It is important to note that a high viral load is not an absolute in relation to the severity of the disease. In non-human hosts such as sooty mangabeys, a high SIV load is not associated with clinical symptoms 85 . Recent studies indicate that the decline in CD4 + T-cell counts, and not the increase in viral load, is a better predictor of disease progression 86 . . Phylogenetic trees based on nucleotide distance were constructed by neighbour-joining methods as implemented in ClustalX with 1,000 bootstrap resamplings (not presented) and schematically represented with the TreeView program. HIV-2 and HIV-1 share only 50-60% sequence identity and cluster at distinct locations on the phylogenetic tree whereas SIV cpz branches out from the root of the HIV-1 groups. The origins of these HIV-1 groups in southern Cameroon have recently been described and indicate two probable jumps from chimpanzee (groups M and N) and gorilla (group O) species. HIV-1 M subtypes probably evolved from a discrete introduction into the human population and then diverged into different subtypes. The subtypes defined as 'A-like' describe HIV-1 isolates with sequences that map phylogenetically more to subtype A than to any other subtype. For example, the recombinant form CRF02_AG (such as 02 AG.NG.IBNG in the HIV-1 group M A-like cluster) has longer genomic segments that are more related to subtype A than to subtype G. M, main; N, new. The first evidence that specific viral genetic traits might affect virulence was the identification of long-term non-progressing individuals harbouring a defective HIV-1 isolate lacking a nef open reading frame 87, 88 .

Treatment practice of COVID-19 showed that early intervention of TCM is important way to improve cure rate, shorten the course of disease, delay disease progression and reduce mortality rate.

However, this gain might not be sufficient to reverse the loss in pathogenic fitness that occurs during transmission and early disease. The extreme genetic bottleneck following transmission reduces the HIV-1 population size and diversity by at least 10,000-fold. In vitro studies indicate that this genetic reduction correlates with a significant fitness loss. The few HIV-1 clones establishing infection must evade the immune system, resulting in yet another series of genetic bottlenecks reducing fitness. Therefore, attenuation of virulence might occur if the net fitness loss during transmission or early disease is greater than the increase in pathogenic fitness during disease progression and between transmission events. Greater diversity in HLA alleles in African populations compared with Caucasian populations might result in stronger immune pressure in the human population and possibly faster rates of HIV-1 attenuation. Is the global dominance of HIV-1 subtype C related to an attenuation of virulence? Does subtype C infection lead to slower disease progression and more opportunities for new transmission events? These questions might hold the key to the future of the HIV-1 epidemic and could provide a new focus for ARV treatment and vaccine design.",29.78253530998814,13.017199073621887

Therefore, 'slow' disease progression during 1986-1988 might be associated with the accrual of patients with more advanced disease. In general, natural history cohorts starting at early or acute infection and ending with AIDS-defining illnesses or morbidity (typically 3-10 years without ARV treatment) provide the best estimates of CD4 + T-cell decline and disease progression rates 125 . In the developed world, cohorts from the 1980s are not readily available owing to late diagnosis, whereas the current cohorts are difficult to assess for the natural history of disease due to ARV intervention. Finally, given the reduced HLA diversity and greater ethnic homogeneity in the Caucasian population, the attenuation rate of subtype B HIV-1 virulence might be less dramatic than the attenuation possible with non-B subtypes in sub-Saharan Africa.",31.43455174712454,12.787596102573872

Following this early period of the AIDS epidemic, there seems to be some evidence for slowing rates of disease progression from 1992-1998. Interestingly, the period following 1992 also corresponds to increasing use of combination ARV treatment, which could only be indirectly related to this attenuation as none of the patients received ARVs during the study period. It is possible that drug resistance mutations might have appeared at a higher frequency during sub-optimal treatment from 1992-1998, that is, before the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

Accounting for behavioural mechanisms that determine uptake of infectious disease interventions such as vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can significantly alter predicted health outcomes in a population. However, most previous approaches that model interactions between human behaviour and disease dynamics have modelled behaviour of these two interventions separately. Here, we develop and analyze an agent based network model to gain insights into how behaviour toward both interventions interact adaptively with disease dynamics (and therefore, indirectly, with one another) during the course of a single epidemic where an SIRV infection spreads through a contact network. In the model, individuals decide to become vaccinated and/or practice NPIs based on perceived infection prevalence (locally or globally) and on what other individuals in the network are doing. We find that introducing adaptive NPI behaviour lowers vaccine uptake on account of behavioural feedbacks, and also decreases epidemic final size. When transmission rates are low, NPIs alone are as effective in reducing epidemic final size as NPIs and vaccination combined. Also, NPIs can compensate for delays in vaccine availability by hindering early disease spread, decreasing epidemic size significantly compared to the case where NPI behaviour does not adapt to mitigate early surges in infection prevalence. We also find that including adaptive NPI behaviour strongly mitigates the vaccine behavioural feedbacks that would otherwise result in higher vaccine uptake at lower vaccine efficacy as predicted by most previous models, and the same feedbacks cause epidemic final size to remain approximately constant across a broad range of values for vaccine efficacy. Finally, when individuals use local information about others' behaviour and infection prevalence, instead of population-level information, infection is controlled more efficiently through ring vaccination, and this is reflected in the time evolution of pair correlations on the network. This model shows that accounting for both adaptive NPI behaviour and adaptive vaccinating behaviour regarding social effects and infection prevalence can result in qualitatively different predictions than if only one type of adaptive behaviour is modelled.",30.147248988444005,11.002582890076475

Guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in children are even more restrictive, again recommending that tests should mainly be used on patients with severe disease, with a focus on blood cultures and detection of respiratory viruses [11, 12] . Common to these guidelines is a cautious approach to the use of molecular diagnostics, although this may change with ongoing reviews. This caution is driven partly by the perceived and real lack of commercial and standardized assays and partly by lack of good data on diagnostic accuracy. There is also a lingering perception that molecular diagnostics are expensive tests and that use should be restricted on this basis.

Macrophages are the preferred host cell for MAP, and the ability of pathogenic mycobacteria including MAP to inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion is fundamental to its survival and persistence within the host. Experimental in vitro and in vivo work indicates that MAP-infected cattle develop a proinflammatory immune response early after intestinal infection, which is probably driven by innate intestinal T lymphocytes including gammadelta T cells and natural killer cells. However, in animals that fail to clear the infection, the early proinflammatory response eventually gives way to an apparently ineffective but robust MAP-specific antibody response.

The rate of disease progression and the length of the subclinical period of Johne's disease are irregular and can be protracted; clinical cows are rarely <2 years of age.

As discussed in the next four reviews, however, this situation appears to be changing. Thus, these reviews focus on our current understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, TB, malaria, diarrheal diseases and emerging infections, such as viral hemorrhagic infection fevers and SARS. As discussed by Derden and Silvestri, the AIDS pandemic, with some 40 million HIV-infected people, is undoubtedly one of the most tragic experiments of nature in recent human history. Despite much progress, the precise immunological mechanisms that determine disease progression and the establishment of chronicity are poorly understood. As the authors point out, a key advance in recent years is the identification of two distinct phases of infection -an acute, early phase, characterized by massive infection of CD4 + CCR5 + memory T cells in mucosal tissues, and a chronic phase of generalized immune activation and slow attrition of CD4 + T cells. Intriguingly, natural SIV infection of sooty mangebeys results in high levels of viral replication and lack of pathogenicity. Taken together, these observations suggest that our conceptual understanding of the relationships between specific aspects of innate immune function, immune activation in general, viral loads and disease progression are poorly understood. Thus, the answers to fundamental questions concerning the early innate events that occur after HIV infection, how these modulate the quality of the ensuing adaptive immune response, the role of regulatory T cells, and how such responses result in immune deficiency and chronicity are urgently needed.",26.082568385958204,11.180240367418364

Only a few nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection with HIV-1 and infected animals do not progress to AIDS. 56 Therefore, it is important to use other disease models that mimic the HIV-AIDS pathologic progression. 57 One such potential model is feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). FIV was discovered in 1986 and is known to cause an AIDS-like disease in domestic cats and mimics HIV-related dementia in humans. 58 A vaccine for FIV was approved by the FDA in 2002. 59 While the FIV model is potentially informative, its use is not sufficient as a basis for development of a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. An ideal animal model would display a pathological response to infection with HIV-1 that is very similar to the one that occurs in humans. Unfortunately, HIV-1 does not cause pathology leading to the development of AIDS in any host other than humans. [60] [61] [62] [63] However, animal models have been developed and used that allow partial understanding of the pathology of HIV-1, the natural immunological response to infection, and the response of the host to novel therapeutics. One of these models involves the simian immunodeficiency virus MAC (SIV MAC ) that replicates and causes an AIDS-like disease in baboons, cynomolgus, and pigtailed macaques. While the similarities of SIV MAC to HIV-1 have allowed for insight into pathology, transmission, and immunological response of the infected host to the virus, the differences between SIV MAC and HIV-1 are still too great to be able to draw conclusions regarding potential human responses to an HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine. 63 Therefore, to broaden the scope of animal model usage, a chimeric SHIV virus was engineered to incorporate both SIV and HIV-1 proteins or genes. 64 While macaques infected with SHIV do go on to develop AIDS, the time to progression is much different from the time to progression to AIDS of HIV-1-infected humans. Infection of macaques with SIV mac 251 strain mimics HIV-1 infection in humans by leading to chronic, slow disease progression. Route and dose required for infection, viral tropism, replicative capacity of the viruses, and pathology of SIV/SHIV-infected monkeys are all very different than these parameters in humans. 65, 66 This distinction has been well characterized by the recent Phase IIb STEP trial, which involved 3000 healthy, uninfected volunteers. The result of this trial was termination at its first scheduled efficacy assessment due to its failure to suppress viral load in subsequently infected individuals and then-suspected increased HIV-1 infection due to interaction of the immune system with vaccine components. 67 The vaccine, a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) virus incorporating the gag, pol, and nef genes from HIV-1, had been previously tested in an SHIV model in macaques and the results of that experiment were not suggestive of the results of the human trial. 68 This disparity underscores the need for animal models that more closely reflect the pathology seen in human infection with HIV-1 as well as identification of immunological correlates of protection that reflect control of HIV-1 viral load in human subjects. Therefore, the search for an appropriate animal model or the appropriate use of current animal models in the search for a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine continues. Until a model can be derived that will allow for observation of each stage of infection, progression of disease, and response of the immune system in a way that is comparable to this process in humans, we will not be able to logically predict which vaccine candidates should be moved forward to clinical trials.",29.094253480898857,14.163008240027857

Simulation studies have shown that (1) HIV is continuously replicating with a high turn-over rate during the asymptomatic phase of the infection, which enables the virus to evolve at a fast rate [50, 51] , and (2) successful therapy can suppress virus below detection limit but complete virus eradication is not possible under normal circumstances because of long-lived latently infected cells [52, 53] . Relatively simple models describe the effect of antigenic escape on disease progression, and are examples of the general principle that virus evolution can drive disease progression and the destruction of the immune system [54] [55] [56] . A large number of experimental studies [56] have demonstrated the enormous potential of the virus to escape from any kind of selective pressure exerted by CTL responses, antibody responses or drug treatment.

Relatively straightforward experiments could test the functional status of APCs in infected animals through intracellular or extracellular staining for EBOV gene products and cellular factors (e.g. cytokines). Ideally, such experiments would quantify the frequency of infection of different APC types and the cytokines secreted by different cells types. Isolation of in vivo infected APCs and testing their ability to process antigen and stimulate an EBOV antigen-specific response ex vivo would provide a more clear understanding their functional status and allow comparison to studies performed in cells infected in vitro. Given the copious production of cytokines, chemokines and possibly viral products, it is possible that APCs and other immune cells that are not directly infected will exhibit altered function. Therefore, it will also be important to assess the functional status of uninfected APCs and lymphocytes from the same infected animals. For example, it might prove fruitful to assess the ability of T cells to respond to either allo-or superantigens from competent non-infected MHC-compatible or incompatible APCs. Such studies would not only inform our understanding of APCs but also better describe the status of the adaptive immune response. This is particularly important in NHPs, which most closely mimic severe human infections. Functional T cells have been shown to be present in EBOV-infected mice (Bradfute et al., 2008) .

It is in the host's interest to detect and stop the progression of an infection early by mounting a timely inflammatory response; conversely, it is important for the pathogen to subvert the innate immune system-that is, the first defense response of the host in order to establish an infection. The pathogen must also prevent an excessive inflammatory reaction not only to avoid elimination but also to ensure its own survival by keeping the host alive. To this end, pathogens have evolved strategies to disrupt host immune signaling cascades that culminate in drastic transcriptional upregulation of several proinflammatory and other immune response genes.

In Western countries, tobacco smoke is the major cause for COPD, accounting for 90-95% of the cases. Since only 20% of smokers develop severe COPD, other factors (biological, hereditary, environmental) must be involved [ 4 ] . Narrowing of the airways by in fl ammation, mucus production, irreversible remodelling and emphysema results in a limitation of expiratory air fl ow and disturbed gas exchange [ 5 ] . Currently, it is estimated that 210 million people suffer from COPD worldwide, a number that is still increasing. By 2020, the World Health Organization predicts that COPD will rise from the sixth to the third leading cause of death, next to only cardiovascular disease and cancer [ 6 ] . According to the Global Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) de fi nition, diagnosis of COPD should be based on spirometry measurements with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s over forced vital capacity ratio (FEV 1 /FVC) below 0.7. Subsequently, COPD can be categorized in different stages of severity (GOLD stages) going from mild, moderate and severe to very severe disease according to FEV 1 [ 7 ] . It should be noted, however, that the majority of COPD patients, especially in the early stages of the disease, report no complaints, do not perform spirometry and thus are unaware of their disease. Treatment for COPD focuses on minimizing symptoms and preventing exacerbations. With the exception of smoking cessation, so far, no treatment has clearly proven to signi fi cantly modify COPD disease progression.

We show in this study that there is an alternative to purified Ab preparations for passive immunization. Gene-based delivery of protective recAbs offers a number of advantages. First, the recAbs are produced in vivo and therefore are properly processed by the host mechanisms. Second, there is no need for recAb purification, although clinical vector preparations have to be produced according to the accepted criteria.

This progression depends upon a number of intervening variables, including the pathogenicity of the agent, the route of transmission of the agent to the host, and the nature and strength of the host's response. All of these factors, in turn, are affected by the natural and social environments in which the agent and host are juxtaposed; in some cases, the environment may promote the transmission of the agent to the host, while in other cases it may limit or even prevent such transmission.

Evidence for a dysregulated host innate immune response in H5N1 infections comes from clinical observations and animal models of infections (reviewed in Peiris et al. 2009 8 ) . H5N1 infections induce high levels of proinflammatory serum cytokines and chemokines (e.g. MCP-1 IL-6, TNF-a and IL-8) which correlate with nasopharyngeal viral loads. 9 H5N1 infection of macaques also shows markedly elevated levels of innate cytokine production that corresponds to prolonged, highlevel viral replication. 10 H5N1 preferentially infected type II pneumocytes in the lung that function to maintain lung integrity and repair that are compromised during influenza infection. 10 Of note, fatal cases of pandemic H1N1 virus infection show viral replication in both type I and II pneumocytes. 11 In a novel attempt to reduce disease severity, a CXCR3 antagonist (AMG487) has been used to block an innate signalling pathway in a ferret model. Ferrets infected with H5N1 and treated with AMG487 showed a reduction in weight loss and viral load, although final mortality rates were the same for both treated and untreated ferrets. 12 Although elevated cytokine levels are associated with enhanced disease in H5N1 infection, the pathogenesis of disease remains incompletely understood. It is unclear whether severe disease and ongoing viral replication cause the dysregulated cytokine patterns observed, or whether and to what extent the cytokine dysregulation causes the severe disease. Correlations exist between increased viral load and increased cytokine levels, 8 so that continued viral replication is a contributing factor to disease. One strategy to elucidate the mechanisms of the early innate responses to infection is to use in vitro systems employing primary human epithelial cells and macrophages. Both epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages can be infected with H5N1 virus, and cytokines produced by each cell type act in an autocrine and paracrine manner. 13 Studies to date have shown that primary human macrophages infected with H5N1 differentially express proinflammatory cytokines by stronger activation of the p38MAPK and IRF-3 cell signalling pathways. [14] [15] [16] [17] In addition, primary human macrophages infected with H5N1 produce highly elevated levels of TNF-a, IFN-b and IFN-k1 in comparison with seasonal H1N1 infection. 17 Transcriptomic studies on macrophages infected with H5N1 and seasonal H1N1 influenza infection show that the marked differences between these viruses are quantitative rather than qualitative differences resulting from activating unique signalling pathways. 18 Primary epithelial cells infected with H5N1 also upregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines like IFN-b, IL-6, IL-8 and chemokines. 19 The cytokines produced by the epithelial cells and macrophages represent only the start of the immune response, and their paracrine action further amplifies and broadens the host response. As infection progresses, leucocytes are recruited to the infection site, thus enabling adaptive immunity to develop. Because H5N1 infection causes an early rise in chemokines, it is expected that increased numbers of immune cells are also recruited to the lung. Cyclooxygenase -2 (cox-2) has been found to play a central role in amplifying this proinflammatory response and therefore may be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention. 13 In addition, recent in vitro studies showed that endothelial cells also upregulate cytokine expression in a manner similar to that seen in epithelial cells after H5N1 infection. 20 Because H5N1 viruses can infect and egress from endothelial cells from either the apical or basolateral aspect, this provides a mechanism by which these viruses may spread systemically. 20 Upregulation of the cytokine response by H5N1 viruses appears owing to the viral polymerase genes. 21 Whilst the degree of cytokine induction is related in part to polymerase activity, the viral polymerase proteins can also interact with host cell factors involved in signalling cascades 22 This raises the question of how this information could be used to direct therapeutic interventions. One area for study is to determine whether antiviral drugs that inhibit polymerase activity (e.g. favipiravir) could be useful as both antiviral and immunomodulator.",27.98485831149633,12.964700568764163

Cytokines are glycoprotein molecules that regulate inflammatory and immune responses by acting as a signal between cells. 267 Cytokines of major interest in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia include TNF-α, the interleukins, chemokines, and growth factors such as granulocytemonocyte colony-stimulating factor. TNF-α is thought of as the most ""proximal"" cytokine released in response to LPS. Studies corroborate this by showing that administration of recombinant TNF-α mimics the effects of LPS 268 and that antibodies directed against TNF-α protect against the lethal effects of endotoxin. 269 Increased plasma activity of TNF is associated with increased mortality in equine patients with acute gastrointestinal disease and in septic neonates. 231 Despite being a structurally diverse group of proteins, cytokines share several characteristics that allow them to execute their complex functions in the inflammatory response. 267 Any individual cytokine generally is produced by several different cell types, can act on different cell types, and has multiple effects on any given cell. Furthermore, cytokine effects are redundant, meaning that different cytokines can share the same effect. In endotoxemia this is particularly true for the effects of IL-1 and TNF-α. 270 Many of the biologic activities of cytokines in vivo result from synergistic or antagonistic actions involving two or more cytokines. 271 Within itself the cytokine response is highly regulated: cytokines induce or suppress synthesis of other cytokines, including their own (feedback regulation); regulate expression of cytokine receptors; and regulate cytokine activities. Additional regulatory mechanisms include the release of specific cytokine inhibitors such as soluble IL-1 and TNF-α receptors; cytokine receptor antagonists such as the IL-1 receptor antagonist; and antiinflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, IL-4, IL-13, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Glucocorticoids, which are produced increasingly in response to endotoxin, also inhibit the production of cytokines. 272 During a ""controlled"" inflammatory response, therefore, cytokine secretion is a self-limited event, whereas excessive stimulation of cytokine production can lead to the perpetuation of the inflammatory response even after the initial stimulus has been removed. Aberrations from the controlled, self-regulated inflammatory response have been described as predominantly proinflammatory (SIRS), antiinflammatory or hypoinflammatory (compensatory antiinflammatory response syndrome [CARS]), or combined (mixed antagonist response syndrome) responses. 273 That these responses may not represent a continuum in response to infection was demonstrated in a recent study investigating cytokine profiles in an experimental model of sepsis. 274 Here, increased plasma concentration of antiinflammatory mediators such as IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL-10 in the early phase of sepsis predicted early mortality almost as accurately as the typical proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Cytokine profiles failed to predict mortality in the later stages of sepsis, thereby suggesting that late outcome is not ""preprogrammed"" early on in the disease. A progression from proinflammatory (SIRS) to antiinflammatory (CARS), as previously proposed, could not be demonstrated. 274 The authors concluded that use of biomarkers may be helpful in determining the inflammatory status of clinical patients suffering from sepsis and that the success of treatments aimed at suppressing or stimulating immune responses may depend on the individual patient's inflammatory profile.",30.45225406186588,13.35277764373901

Two classes of antiviral drugs are currently approved for use in patients with influenza [102] . In addition, numerous antiviral drugs directed against multiple targets of the influenza virus life cycle have progressed to preclinical or early clinical stages (reviewed in [103, 104] ). Fewer candidates exist for other respiratory viruses [105] , and none so far has reached the approval stage [106] . Unlike antibiotics, which can eliminate or greatly reduce pathogen burden, existing influenza antiviral drugs serve only to halt progression of disease by preventing new host cells from being infected. If this intervention is administered early enough in the clinical course, it may alter the tempo of infection, allowing normal immune clearance mechanisms to gain the upper hand. Earlier treatment works better in most cases because the infection is not yet widespread [107, 108] . Thus, the major effects of treatment are symptom reduction and a more rapid recovery, not immediate clinical cure. In the context of preventing SBI, the continued presence of the virus and the ongoing host response suggests that many of the mechanisms discussed above may remain operative despite treatment.

Conflicting results from different studies of children with bronchiolitis make definitive conclusion about which cellular regulation and cytokines are at play. One study has documented that nasopharyngeal cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1B and IL-8 are more significantly elevated in more severe RSV-related disease [39] , whilst another study revealed that the T helper (Th) 17 related cytokines IL-1B, IL-17A and IL-23 were associated with a reduction in clinical symptoms [40] . Certainly it seems likely that an uncontrolled or abnormal host response to viruses determines clinical outcome. It is also likely that the inflammatory cellular response influences disease severity, with for example, formation of neutrophil extra-cellular traps (NETs) in abundance in more severe disease that occlude small airways [41] . Whilst the role of vitamin D in disease association has been demonstrated for a host of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions at least one study suggest that vitamin D insufficiency is not characteristic of more severe bronchiolitis [42] . The viral infection starts in the upper respiratory tract and spreads to the lower tract within a few days, resulting in inflammation of the bronchiolar epithelium and edema of the submucosa and adventitia [43] . Plugs of sloughed, necrotic epithelium, fibrin and excessive mucus secretions add to airway obstruction, causing partial or total obstruction to airflow [44] . A ""ball-valve"" mechanism can result in trapping of air distal to obstructed areas, with subsequent absorption, atelectasis, and a mismatch of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion that may lead to hypoxemia. Smooth-muscle constriction does not contribute significantly to airway obstruction. Although these mechanisms are known for RSV bronchiolitis, it is assumed that other viruses produce similar pathological conditions.

In diseases that share a common set of symptoms, some rare, such diagnosis is often complicated and prolonged, especially for heterogeneous disorders that need additional information to enable classification and subsequent specific treatments. Genetic and environmental factors create additional variability in disease severity, progression and treatment responses. Thus, traditional assays together with the aforementioned current omics technologies, that allow monitoring of thousands of molecular components, will facilitate and accelerate differential diagnostics and sub-classification through utilizing a more complete set of disease markers.

Alternatively, some disease processes are mediated by the host response to viral infections, and detection of antibody is key.

More recently, aberrant immune responses and cytokine production have been associated with the pathogenesis of multiple disease states ranging from viral infection to neurological disorders [3] . Despite a definitive link of cytokine and chemokine levels with morbidity and mortality following infectious insults, no effective therapeutic treatments or modalities have been developed to quell the pathology associated with cytokine storm. In fact, the apparent intractability of tested therapies to subdue pathology has led some to postulate whether robust cytokine and chemokine production observed during these disease states is directly causal to the clinical manifestations. One major reason for this is that the kinetics, cellular sources, and cytokine milieu that mediate disease pathology remain poorly understood.

Gene expression data were compared with clinical observations and with gene expression data obtained from 55 nontransplant HCV-infected and uninfected liver samples.

The corresponding genes encoded stress response proteins and blood proteins involved in coagulation that were differentially expressed in response to post-transplantation graft recovery. The second pattern was specific to HCV-infected samples and included the increased expression of genes encoding components of the interferonmediated antiviral response and immune system. This pattern was absent or suppressed in the patients who developed early fibrosis, indicating that disease progression might result from an impaired liver response to infection.

Pathogens are initially detected by the surveillance cells of the innate immune system using cell surface receptors known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (reviewed in ). These TLRs recognize specifi c components of the pathogen, for example, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or double-stranded (ds) RNA from viruses. While many cell types express TLRs, cells of the innate immune system such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages play particularly important roles in detecting and responding to pathogens. The response of these cells to a pathogen is determined by the specifi c pathogen component that interacts with the TLR and the specifi c TLR family member that is activated. Widespread changes in gene expression are detected following TLR activation and the activated cells produce a plethora of cytokines and chemokines that then activate the adaptive arm of the immune system. The specifi c cytokines and chemokines produced by the TLR-activated cells tailor the response of the adaptive immune system to deal with the specifi c pathogen . Thus, the initial host response to a pathogen through the TLRs determines the outcome of the infection. Host response to infection can be a double-edged sword in that sometimes the response itself can create an adverse outcome for the host. In addition, the aberrant response of the host to self instead of foreign pathogens can create severe pathologies involving chronic infl ammatory and autoimmune diseases.",28.99163201292361,12.29297132883471

For HIV-1 and other lentiviruses, an efficient early control of virus replication by the host immune response is generally associated with limited disease severity. In HIV-1, the viral load that follows after the initial immune response to the virus is referred to as the ""set point."" In the absence of early therapy, low set points in HIV-1 are generally attributed to a strong cellular immune response, likely influenced by host and viral factors. [This and other aspects of HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis have been reviewed in excellent monographs by Levy (2007) ]. A low set point predicts an asymptomatic outcome, and this is generally the case for viruses that establish persistent rather than acute infections. Again, viral population numbers, derived from the virus-host interaction, play a critical role in the result of an infection. Given a host environment, an initial high viral fitness during the early stages of viral replication can promote disease manifestations. An example was provided by the progression toward disease of a cohort of individuals that were infected during blood transfusion with an HIV-1 containing a large deletion in Nef. After more than 15 years, some of the infected individuals showed clinical signs, probably as a result of accumulation of mutations in the HIV-1 genome that compensated for the lack of Nef, an adaptor protein that mediates replication and pathogenesis (reviewed in Arien and Verhasselt, 2008) . More generally, fitness-decreasing (but not lethal) genetic lesions in a viral genome may be compensated by additional genomic mutations that become increasingly dominant in the course of further viral replication. The kinetics of fitness gain will depend on the nature of the lesion and the functional implications of the altered protein or genomic regulatory region (Chapter 5).",27.077233590770323,11.614634288679555

To overcome these limitations and best capture the antiviral landscape, transcriptomics of bronchial brush samples was performed. Several modules, or sets of genes with similar co-expression patterns, were identified as being differentially expressed during mild and severe infection. The enrichment for a subset of these modules correlated directly with viral titers, identifying potential virus-dependent transcriptional networks. The gene sets comprising these modules were associated with immunerelated processes, including inflammatory cytokine production and antiviral responses. Animals with severe disease outcomes were found to diverge from those with mild disease by having weak activation of these modules early during infection, followed by strong activation at later points during infection.

The early detection of sepsis still has to be solved in clinical practice. The delayed diagnosis often contributes to inappropriate antimicrobial treatment and subsequent high mortality. Sepsis biomarkers are produced during the host response to infection. Traditional biomarkers are polypeptides and/or proteins derived from this response. Omics-based biomarkers are screening out from all kinds of molecules of host response while high-throughout omics technologies are emerging. This review describes traditional and potential omics-based sepsis biomarkers from currently available literatures. The combination of these biomarkers would refine the identification of sepsis for further clinical and experimental sepsis studies.,38.1601365498429,15.208803279410194

We have alluded above to the notion of disease activity. Current models of periodontal disease progression posit that tissue destruction progresses through periods of acute exacerbations (activity) followed by periods of remission (120, 130, 133, 134) . At any given time, different sites in an individual's mouth might be at different stages of disease progression. Clinically, the only way of determining that a periodontal site has undergone periodontal disease progression is by measuring longitudinal changes in clinical attachment level. This implies that in order to determine disease activity, longitudinal monitoring at close time intervals is required. This has been the approach used by many investigators in the past in order to assess risk factors for periodontal disease initiation and progression (133) . Typically, study subjects are monitored clinically every two months and bacterial samples are collected at baseline and when disease progression is diagnosed and the microbial composition of the subgingival microbiota examined to determined species potentially involved in disease progression (87) . Limitations of early studies were the lowthroughput of existing microbiological techniques, which limited how many samples could be conveniently collected and processed. Nevertheless, these studies have helped implicate several subgingival species in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.",33.968693043532205,14.364831051240149

These drugs block the activity of cyclooxygenases, preventing the metabolism of arachidonic acid. A series of animal studies in the 1980s demonstrated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were capable of slowing the progression of periodontal diseases (154) . Human clinical studies followed and demonstrated similar results (398) ; however, the safety profile of these drugs did not allow for their prolonged continuous use. Drugs that selectively inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 were received with great enthusiasm because they promised to minimize the gastrointestinal adverse effects observed with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (306) . However, the long-term use of these drugs were later associated with the occurrence of congestive heart failure in a significant proportion of subjects (170) . The only therapeutic adjunct on the market for periodontal disease therapy that interferes with the host-response is low-dose doxycycline (Periostat®) (116, 117) . The mechanism by which this drug is supposed to control periodontal tissue destruction is through its anti-collagenolytic activity, resulting from the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (115) . However, it has been demonstrated that the use of low-dose doxycycline also results in changes in the proportion of subgingival bacterial species that are resistant to doxycycline, demonstrating its impact on the subgingival microbiota (129) . Therefore, the therapeutic effect of this agent cannot be ascribed solely to its modulation of the host response.",30.70330884302672,13.7301640230989

These concepts have been the cornerstones of our understanding of periodontal diseases for decades and elegantly acknowledged the microbial challenge and the immunoinflammatory host response as key elements of periodontal disease etiology and pathogenesis. However, in recent years, this simple framework has been challenged once more by efforts to assign greater importance to the immunoinflammatory response compared to the microbiota in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. Such emphasis on host factors has led some authors to hypothesize that they might outweigh bacteria as determinants of periodontal disease onset and severity (266) . One might argue that with so much still to be learned about the composition of the subgingival microbiota and its functions that these statements were rather premature. In addition, trying to determine the proportion of disease due to either bacteria or the host response might be counter productive as it is clear that neither factor alone will cause periodontal tissue destruction.

Hence, there is a rationale for use of therapeutic interventions that dampen or reduce, as well as those that enhance or augment, the inflammatory response.

Probiotics remain outside the established antimicrobial armamentarium and are fraught with the potential for harm in immunocompromised hosts [51] .

Nonetheless, it has been hypothesized that the benefit of low-dose macrolide therapy in chronic pulmonary diseases, could be as a result of macrolide-induced reductions in levels of inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil recruitment and biofilm formation, which have been observed in animal models and/or in vitro [57] . In contrast to macrolides, amphotericin B [58] and penicillin [59] induce the release of inflammatory mediators in vitro through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated stimulation.

The balance between protective and pathogenic immune responses is critical (Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010) . A pivotal role in this balance is played by innate immune effectors that detect the presence of viral products by pattern recognition receptors, thus initiating the host response (Iwasaki, 2012) . The specific cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators produced in response to immune activation, as well as downstream adaptive responses that themselves can modulate the innate response, can skew the relative balance between aggressive responses that rapidly clear infection and responses that minimize the extent of immunopathology.

Therapeutic antibodies are among the most expensive drugs used in clinical practice (Kasuya et al., 2005) . The high cost of Ig preparations is related to the fact that these reagents require special handling and are costly to obtain, produce, and maintain. Immunoglobulins derived from immune donors may contain adventitious agents (including yet unknown ones) or may be potentially bio-hazardous otherwise, since the 100% purity cannot be achieved. In addition, in vitro production of Abs, especially the full size, two-chain Abs, requires tedious optimization and the yields are often low. We show in this study that there is an alternative to purified Ab preparations for passive immunization. Gene-based delivery of protective recAbs offers a number of advantages. First, the recAbs are produced in vivo and therefore are properly processed by the host mechanisms. Second, there is no need for recAb purification, although clinical vector preparations have to be produced according to the accepted criteria. Third, the recAb gene expression is maintained over time, thus eliminating the need for repeated injections of Abs to maintain therapeutic concentrations. An important safety feature of the proposed treatment is that we used a replication incompetent Ad vector for recAb gene delivery. The ability of replication-deficient Ad vectors to mediate transient gene transfer looks especially attractive in the context of acute infectious disease treatment with recAbs.",28.729848969887456,11.289655565340087

In humans, filovirus infections are associated with high viremia, increased endothelial cell permeability and severe tissue destruction, lymphopenia, and coagulopathy. Both EBOV and MARV can cause severe disease and viral hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. Disease outbreaks caused by the Zaire EBOV (ZEBOV) subtype and MARV have had case fatality rates of as high as 80-90%. In contrast, the Reston EBOV (REBOV) has not been associated with disease in humans, but is lethal for non-human primates (Groseth et al., 2002; Hutchinson et al., 2001; Jahrling et al., 1996; Morikawa et al., 2007; . These observations raise an important question regarding virulence: do all filoviruses evoke similar responses in human cells? Because the ability of EBOV and MARV to cause severe disease appears to be associated with their capacity to replicate to high titers, is evasion of the type I IFN response a common feature? Does the host response to REBOV differ in significant ways that might explain its attenuation in humans?

This article has shown how global gene expression studies have be used to detail the global relationship between antagonism of host antiviral responses during severe fulminant RNA viral infection and how selective tissue sampling considerations can be developed to better characterize the activation of inflammatory cascades and the development of severe pathology. As the importance of immune cell activation, killing and immunpopathology become more prominent, isolation of infected and/or immune cells from infected tissue or blood samples using FACS or LCM as a method to isolate specific cell populations for genomics analysis should become more widely used. Discovery-based genomics approaches can aid in identifying the host response pathways associated with immunopathology and contribute to a more detailed understanding of how global host responses are regulated during viral infection that will be critical for the development of novel antiviral treatments. Thus, an important goal for developing new antiviral therapies is the development of multi-target approaches that both inhibit viral enzymatic activities and limit the activation of deleterious immune responses associated with the development of immunopathology. While it may seem counter-intuitive to block host responses to infection, a limited and temporary inhibition of some host inflammatory response could provide additional protection against the development of severe disease pathology and improve clinical outcome. The strength of genomics-based approaches lies in their ability to characterize the global effects of infection and to serve as a discovery-based tool to identify new host response components and pathways for further study, which may ultimately lead to novel targets of therapeutic intervention.",32.07573564683697,12.217012626353455

Such a delay in diagnosis may be prevented by the development of diagnostic biomarkers. Encephalitis, for example, is a complex, severe, neurological syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is characterized by inflammation of the brain parenchyma, and children often present with drowsiness, fever, headache, seizures, or focal neurological signs. A delay in treatment may lead to irreversible brain damage. Diagnosis is often presumptive and based on clinical characteristics or increased serological antibody titers. Unfortunately, the causative pathogen is often hard to detect in the central nervous system itself. The final diagnosis is sometimes based on the detection of pathogens in cultures from other sites such as the respiratory tract (Glaser et al., 2006) . Indirectly diagnosing encephalitis based on respiratory samples is rather inaccurate and demonstrates the need for new and better diagnostic tools. New microarray and proteomics technologies may contribute to improved diagnosis and treatment. Microarrays have been developed to simultaneously identify different viral and bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Boriskin et al., 2004; Ben et al., 2008) . To our knowledge, gene expression studies for differentiating pathogens based on the host response have not yet been performed.

This difference in in vivo cytokine responses during acute phase could be reproduced when paired age and sex-matched severe and non-severe cases infected with a clonal GAS strain were tested in vitro during their convalescent phase for immune response to culture supernatants from their infecting isolate. These findings indicated that the propensity to be either a high or a low responder to superantigens is a stable feature of the host, which may contribute to severity of disease. Further studies revealed that specific HLA class II haplotypes conferred protection from severe disease, whereas others increased the risk of severe disease. Functional analysis revealed that the risk HLA types promoted significantly higher cytokine responses against GAS superantigens than did the protective ones. Taken together the studies show that HLA class II molecules that influence the magnitude of immune responses to GAS superantigens play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of invasive GAS infection.",27.63637149855497,12.012357952035972

The drop could have been due to the introduction of high-grade express diagnostics methods into clinical practice and an intensification in seeking out and diagnosing those suspected of having CCHF. At the same time, the disease extended its incidence into the new territories of the Volgograd region, with nosocomial CCHF cases recorded there once again. 52 Pathogenesis. Pathogenesis is defined by lesions of the vascular and nervous systems. 17, 51, 53 Clinical Features. The incubation period after transmissive CCHFV inoculation (as the result of a tick bite) is 2À7 days, whereas that after contact inoculation is 3À4 days. The difference is due to a much higher quantity of virus entering the system during contacts inoculation. 17, 50, 53 CCHF starts rapidly, with the temperature increasing to 39À40 C and the appearance of fever, skin hyperemia in the top half of the trunk, headache, lumbar pain, abdominal and epigastric pains, generalized arthralgia, conjunctivitis, pharingitis, and diarrhea. About 50% of cases have two obvious waves of increasing temperature, with the temperature decreasing in 6À7 days after the end of the incubation period. Petechial rash appears in the majority of all CCHF patients in 3À4 days after the incubation period and is a marker of the second increasing-temperature wave. Hemorrhagic diathesis with nasal bleeding (in two-thirds of cases), bloody vomiting, blood in the sputum, and hematuria, all starting 3À5 days after the end of incubation period, are characteristic in 85% of cases. The duration of the hemorrhagic period is 8À9 days. Meningitis symptoms and signs of psychosis (depression, sleepiness, lassitude, photophobia) could develop as well. Lethality is 16À20% for transmissive inoculation and up to 50% for contact inoculation. Nevertheless, lethality is decreasing as the result of the introduction of modern testing systems and treatment with ribavirin. The convalescent period is about a month. 17, 50, 51, 53 E.V. Leshchinskaya has suggested the following clinical classification of CCHF: (i) severe form with hemorrhagic syndrome (1.a. without band bleeding; 1.b. with band bleeding); (ii) without hemorrhagic syndrome (2.a. medium-severe form; 2.b. light form). 50, 53 Diagnostics. Diagnosis is based on the detection of both specific antibodies via ELISA (IgM after 8 days post disease progression and IgG) and virus RNA via RT-PCR testing (earlier than 8 days post disease progression). 43, 54 Both tests must be conducted for a definitive diagnosis of CCHF to be made. During the first week of infection with CCHF, positive results via RT-PCR are obtained in 93% of cases; during the second week, the percentage is 40%. During the second week of the disease, positive results in IgM via ELISA are obtained in 93% of cases; during the third week, the percentage of positive reults in IgG via ELISA is 80%. 55À58 Control and Prophylaxis. Ribavirin is the most effective drug prescribed today. 53 ,59À61 Ribavirin is used for 5 days after symptoms first appear: 2,000 mg (10 capsules) or 30 mg/kg for the first time, then 600 mg 3 2 times a day if the weight of the patient is more than 75 kg or 500 mg 3 2 times a day if the weight of the patient is is less than 75 kg).

One of the key functions of an- or more are associated with protection from influenza virus infection and are often used as markers of successful immunization in influenza vaccine trials (23, 30) . During the first few days of an infection, the neutralizing antibody titers are often low (34) . However, the magnitude of nonneutralizing antibodies during this period has not been studied. We hypothesized that the nonneutralizing antibodies in the early stage of infection may play a role in the outcome of an infection. To detect nonneutralizing antibodies, we used an ELISA plate coated with a split-virion inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 virus vaccine as antigen, which could detect both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies against the vaccine proteins. We showed that within 2 to 4 days after symptom onset, significantly higher ELISA titers were found for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease, but there was no significant difference in their MN titers. The ELISA/MN titer ratio, which is a surrogate marker for the amount of nonneutralizing antibody, was higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease. Patients requiring PPV, representing those who had the most severe respiratory disease, had higher ELISA titers than those who did not require PPV. The results from our study suggested that an exaggerated nonneutralizing antibody response during the early stage of infection was associated with severe disease. The nonneutralizing antibody present in patients during the early stage of infection was likely to be preexisting or was the result of a secondary heterotypic antibody response against conserved epitopes, which may be found outside the receptor binding pocket of HA or in the highly conserved nucleoprotein, matrix proteins, and polymerase proteins, or even the less conserved NS proteins (11) . This early IgG response can happen within a few days after infection because of immune priming by previous exposure to similar viral epitopes. In our ELISA, we used a split-virion inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine as the coating antigen, and it contained mainly HA but also other proteins of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, including the neuraminidase, the matrix protein, and the nucleoprotein (4). The matrix proteins and nucleoprotein have conserved amino acid sequences, and therefore antibodies against these proteins from prior seasonal influenza virus infection or vaccination could be induced. Upon infection with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, memory B cells can proliferate rapidly and generate a large amount of these highavidity nonneutralizing antibodies, especially in patients with severe disease. This is consistent with the observation that the number of peripheral blood B cells is higher in patients with severe disease than in those with mild disease during the early stage of infection (14) . Nonneutralizing antibodies against influenza virus can have either protective, neutral nonprotective, or detrimental effects. Antibodies against the M2 ectodomain and the nucleoprotein have been shown to be protective in animal models (2, 10, 19, 21) . On the other hand, antibodies against NS1 have been shown to delay viral clearance (21) . This is consistent with the previous finding that a delay in viral clearance rather than a high initial viral load in the respiratory tract is associated with severe disease (37, 38) . Antibodies against PB1-F2 and M1 can be detected in patients with influenza virus infection, but the functional significance of these antibodies is unknown (20, 52) . Other potential effects of nonneutralizing antibody include the activation of the complement cascade and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, which can be protective or detrimental if excessively proinflammatory (1, 27) . Besides the uncertainty of these effects on the clinical outcome, the avidity of such nonneutralizing antibodies for complement activation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity is also unknown. If these effects turn out to be detrimental, it is conceivable that such nonneutralizing antibodies with high avidity would produce more damage to patients than antibodies with low avidity. Though the notion that prior seasonal influenza vaccination is associated with worse outcomes for patients with subsequent A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has been disputed, nonneutralizing antibodies may play a role if this is indeed the case (33) . Detrimental effects of nonneutralizing antibody have been speculated to be associated with poor outcomes of dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles virus infections via antibody-dependent enhancement (42) . Though the laboratory phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement has also been shown for influenza virus, no clinical study has ever been performed to ascertain the link (35) . The pro-or anti-inflammatory effects of nonneutralizing antibody in the pathogenesis and outcome of influenza should be investigated further (3) .",26.355928835914554,12.408578064219263

In this study, we compared the antibody responses of 52 patients with severe or mild disease, using sera collected at admission. A microneutralization (MN) assay was used to detect neutralizing antibody. We also developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which detects both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies against viral antigens from a split-virion inactivated monovalent influenza virus vaccine. While the MN titers were not significantly different between the two groups (P ‫؍‬ 0.764), the ELISA titer and ELISA/MN titer ratio were significantly higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease (P ‫؍‬ 0.004 and P ‫؍‬ 0.011, respectively). This finding suggested that in patients with severe disease, a larger proportion of serum antibodies were antibodies with no detectable neutralizing activity. The antibody avidity was also significantly higher in patients with severe disease than in those with mild disease (P < 0.05). Among patients with severe disease, those who required positive pressure ventilation (PPV) had significantly higher ELISA titers than those who did not require PPV (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the ELISA titer and antibody avidity were independently associated with severe disease. Higher titers of nonneutralizing antibody with higher avidity at the early stage of influenza virus infection may be associated with worse clinical severity and poorer outcomes.",29.282646512627032,12.298554882877866

With natural in vivo FCoV infection, different clinical outcomes (besides resistance to FCoV) have been described: persistent carrier, transiently infection and development of FIP [2] . It is not clear what the viral and host factors are that determine the different clinical outcomes. Since in the inoculation study the same strain (FIPV-79-1146) was used and considering the fact that in the field cats are often infected with the same strain of FCoV, it is likely that genomic variation between cats contributes to a different clinical outcome. A genetic background was also suggested during a field study with pure-bred cats, in which it was shown that susceptibility to FIP is indeed inheritable [7] . A possible explanation for the different disease progression is the possibility of the cats to develop an efficient T-cell response [3] . However, it could also be that the susceptibility of the monocytes to FIPV plays a role, considering the results presented here. It would be interesting to investigate if cats that show a different outcome to an experimental or natural infection also show different infection kinetics in vitro.

The autopsy also may reveal clinically undiagnosed infectious diseases and neoplasms other than the primary cause of death ( Table 2 ). This may benefit epidemiological studies and quality assurance activities in assessing diagnostic or treatment modalities. The forensic autopsies of asymptomatic people who die of unsuspected causes of death other than AIDS has contributed to the understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV disease progression. Furthermore, the identification of HIV-infected subjects at autopsy affords the opportunity for surviving sexual or needle-sharing partners to undergo early testing and counseling and to commence early therapeutic interventions, thus avoiding further dissemination of infection within the community.

Individual biomarker candidates cannot reach the level of specificity and sensitivity needed for proper diagnosis of a disease . A determined number of biomarkers will not only allow for proper treatment of the disease before it is too late, but also provide extensive details on host defense. While this concept has been extensively studied in cancer research, it can be extended to viral diagnostics. This could be especially important in influenza detection, where the severity of the disease varies by the subtype of the virus. A study conducted by Davey et al. demonstrated that seven markers were significantly correlated with disease progression in the serum of influenza H1N1pdm09 patients, IL-6, CD163, IL-10, LBP, IL-2, MCP-1, and IP-10 ( Davey et al., 2013) . Influenza infection can predispose an individual to a secondary bacterial infection that is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus aureus. There is supporting evidence that the influenza A pandemic of 1918 was caused by a synergy of influenza and pneumococcal infections. The host response and disease progression to pneumonia are variable between individuals. Several biomarkers, such as the inflammatory mediator proteins IP-10 and CXCL11, are thought to activate other cells that provide a favorable environment for pneumonia infection. While influenza infection cannot be avoided, the progression to pneumonia can be stopped if these biomarkers are detected early enough after viral infection (Brand et al., 2010) . However, due to the complexity of serum, the sensitivity of detection for this panel can be too low to make an accurate diagnosis.

Several papers have demonstrated that these host responses are increased early during infection and, if prolonged, could actually worsen the disease (known as a 'cytokine storm'; Paquette et al., 2012) . Mouse and ferret animal models have shown that virulent strains of influenza A virus have been associated with increased levels of biomarkers such as IL-6, TNFa, and IFNa. Furthermore, patients' samples show increased IL-6 and IFNa levels in nasal lavage fluids early on in influenza A infection (Davey et al., 2013) . IL-6, an important feature of the host response that can predict disease and outcome, is found in increased levels in the serum of patient samples, which contains many high-abundant proteins. A recent paper demonstrated that IL-6 could be a potential disease severity biomarker for the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A (H1N1pdm09; Paquette et al., 2012) . Infection with VEEV and RVFV also results in increased levels of transcripts of interferon, interferonregulated factors, and Toll-like receptors in the brain such as IFNb and TLR9 (Bouloy et al., 2001; Erwin-Cohen et al., 2012) . In conjunction with high-RVFV viral titers, the level of serum cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, G-GSF) is significantly increased by 72 h postinfection, but drastically drop to normal cytokine levels at 96 h postinfection (van Vuren et al., 2011) . During the course of viral infection, the virus can antagonize these innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to severe disease (Bouloy et al., 2001) . Recently, we have demonstrated that Nanotrap particles can help enhance the detection of IL-8 in cell culture supernatants following RVFV infection (Narayanan et al., 2014) . The detection of early host response biomarkers is a promising avenue to allow accurate early diagnostics prior to severe symptoms of disease. Nanotrap particles have previously been shown to sequester low-abundance chemokines such as CCL28, CCL24, and CXCL12 (Longo et al., 2009) . One core issue with the collection of cytokines is their extremely short half-life (roughly 10 min) and degradation as soon as blood is drawn (Zhou et al., 2010) . Furthermore, cytokines such as IL-6 begin to decrease significantly at 4 h (Paquette et al., 2012) . Nanotrap particles have been shown to protect cytokines from degradation at room temperature (Longo et al., 2009) . Another important class of biomarkers is the cell surface proteins (such as the receptors for cytokines), which are important indicators of disease state and clinical outcome. While FACS analysis is the most common method for cell surface protein analysis, it requires at least several hundreds of thousands of proteins per cell for a measurable signal. Unfortunately, protein levels, such as those found for low-abundant cytokine receptors, can be too low for detection (Joensson et al., 2009) . The Nanotrap particles can work to enrich cytokines and cell surface proteins from serum and nasal swab samples into a smaller sample size while simultaneously excluding serum albumin and immunoglobulins, allowing for their downstream analysis with ELISAs and various multiplex assays (Zhou et al., 2010 ). This will not only enhance early detection but also allow for the comparison of virulent and nonvirulent strains of viruses and the host's immune response.",36.40722740676144,15.054908508510875

This finding suggests that improvement of the disease may depend on inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2, and that FPV controls the disease progression of COVID-19 by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2. Until recently, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 had not been well clarified. Since the infection of SARS-CoV-2 was thought to be self-limited and characterized by systemic inflammation reaction, symptomatic and supportive treatment was mainly recommended by the WHO and the National Health Commission of the PRC. This description is similar to MERS-CoV, for which nonspecific therapeutic interventions are often introduced to prevent severe mor- bidity and mortality [16] . How antivirals would contribute to control of the disease is controversial. Although there have been many registered clinical trials focusing on antiviral drugs for COVID-19, the timing, duration of treatment, and study endpoints have not been unified. In the current study, the time of viral clearance was introduced as a primary endpoint to evaluate the antiviral effect of FPV on the SARS-CoV-2 and successfully identify the priority of FPV. The relationship between the time of viral clearance and the improvement in CT image indicates that viral clearance is an ideal surrogate for the clinical endpoint. A limitation of the present study was that the relationship between the viral titer and the clinical prognosis was not well clarified. Future research could pay more attention to this point. More adverse events were observed in the control arm than in the experimental arm, and were similar to the adverse events observed in studies of AIDS treated by LPV/RTV. It is worth mentioning that the treatment duration of FPV in the present study was twice as long as that used for the treatment of influenza. However, the adverse events in the experimental arm were rare and tolerable, and none of the patients needed to discontinue FPV treatment. These results seem to suggest that the treatment duration of FPV can be prolonged if necessary.",27.92813312054503,12.640376522782343

Despite these clear criteria, diagnosing PD can be difficult, especially in its early stages. In particular, essential tremor and atypical parkinsonian syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) may initially mimic PD. The positive predictive value of the final clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD made by movement disorder specialists was demonstrated to be very high, 98.6% (Hughes et al., 2002) . However, in the same study, almost one third of the clinical diagnoses in patients with parkinsonism had been revised in on average the first five years of the disease (Hughes et al., 2002) . Diagnostic accuracy in the early stages of the disease is important for the patient and, moreover, facilitates evaluation of future neuroprotective therapies. To improve the accuracy of the early diagnosis of PD, biomarkers are urgently needed. Biomarkers can be defined as characteristics that are objectively measured as indicators of normal and pathogenetic processes or responses to a therapeutic intervention. Examples of biomarkers for PD are imaging markers such as striatal dopamine transporter binding measured using single photon emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT) or clinical markers of disease including measurement of non-motor functions such as sense of smell or autonomic function. Proteins in csf and/or blood may also serve as biomarkers for PD, but are not yet used in clinical practice.

However, basic research in MS has not help explain many disorders associated with MS, such as depression, which is the most frequent psychiatric disorder in MS patients. The cause of depression is multifactorial and is likely associated with psychosocial stress, focal demyelinating lesions, and immune dysfunction. Early intervention in depression can prevent a decline in quality of life that typically characterizes MS patients and has even prevented suicide [6] . Despite advances in reducing clinical symptoms in patients with MS through the use of immunomodulating pharmacotherapy, not all respond well to these treatments, especially when the patient is in SPMS, probably due to disease heterogeneity and multi-local, multi-cell damage throughout not only the white matter [7, 8] , but also the gray matter of the central nervous system (CNS). Gray matter involvement has been detected in the earliest stages of MS, and cortical gray matter atrophy has been found to occur at a faster rate than white matter atrophy early in disease progression [9, 10] , suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in MS development and progression.

Once the severity of the disease has been established, the relative CFR takes on primary importance as it becomes the guiding principle for targeting interventions to those populations that are most at risk of severe outcomes. In the 2009 pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) we have a prime example. Early on, limited supplies of antivirals were the only option for prophylaxis and treatment of the disease, and public health agencies needed to decide how these should best be deployed. Later, as limited vaccine became available, officials had to prioritize subpopulations for vaccination.

Pro-inflammatory responses enhance disease progression. The mechanism of immune evasion is mainly characterised by poor antigen presentation by antigen presentating cells (Legge and Braciale 2003) . The antigen presentation is key for activation of T cell and produces chemokines and cytokines that regulate disease progression (Seder et al. 2008) . The immune evasion of novel coronavirus targets APC and suppresses T cell activation. Dendritic cell immunisation activates T cells. As a result, the production of IFNgamma, IL-2 and TNF-alfa are released (Zhao et al. 2010) . Therefore, the viral titre gets reduced as immunisation with Dendritic cells (DC) by T cell activation successfully suppressed viral pathogenesis.

Understanding the differences between the immune systems of domesticated and wild animal hosts and comparing their immune systems to that of humans is crucial for unravelling the complex disease mechanisms that are involved in zoonotic infections (FIG. 2) . Furthermore, by studying the pathogen in its natural host we might be able to devise efficient control measures in that host, thereby disrupting the transmission of the pathogen to humans. This has important implications for predicting, preventing and controlling spillover events and for the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostics. One example is the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Waterfowl are natural hosts for avian influenza viruses, and after infection with HPAI they develop what seems to be a limited inflammatory response of the respiratory system, usually with little or no mortality. By contrast, in chickens and in humans, infection with HPAI viruses can induce a rapid and strong inflammatory response and high levels of cytokine production, often referred to as a cytokine storm 28 , and the infection can become systemic and induce severe disease symptoms [29] [30] [31] . Chickens are acutely susceptible to infection with H5N1 strains of HPAI, which typically cause death within 18-36 hours. Studying waterfowl, such as ducks, and comparing their immune responses to influenza virus with those of chickens might provide invaluable insights into the 'aberrant' immune reactions that occur in influenza virus spillover hosts, such as chickens, pigs and humans (FIG. 3) . Moreover, understanding the mechanisms by which some recent isolates of H5N1 viruses cause systemic disease and death in ducks 32 will help to identify the elements of the immune response that are involved in disease lethality.",26.516574530145128,10.795109296758183

In contrast, the Reston EBOV (REBOV) has not been associated with disease in humans, but is lethal for nonhuman primates (Groseth et al., 2002; Hutchinson et al., 2001; Jahrling et al., 1996; Morikawa et al., 2007; Sanchez et al., 1999) . These observations raise an important question regarding virulence: do all filoviruses evoke similar responses in human cells? Because the ability of EBOV and MARV to cause severe disease appears to be associated with their capacity to replicate to high titers, is evasion of the type I IFN response a common feature? Does the host response to REBOV differ in significant ways that might explain its attenuation in humans? Given their ability to characterize the global host response to infection, expression microarrays and functional genomics have been used to address these questions.",29.888039402709126,13.608438617379468

Microarray molecular signatures obtained from pulmonary autopsy FFPE tissue samples correlated to what is currently known from studying soluble protein markers in either BAL fluids or sera samples from both ARDS and SARS patients. Even though more clinical samples in our study would have contributed to increased statistical significance, these small studies are not unprecedented. 21, 22 The recurring clustering of −ARDS-1 and +ARDS5 hinted that pathogenesis may potentially be influenced by preexisting pulmonary complications. Although neither asthma (−ARDS-1) nor CHF (+ARDS-5) contribute directly to DAD, each disease has associated pulmonary components that could be considered a factor during subsequent infectious challenge and ensuing pathogenesis. 20, [23] [24] [25] This parallels previous suggestions that patient outcome is related to the magnitude and duration of the host inflammatory response and independent of the precipitating cause of ARDS. 13 Another point of interest is that +ARDS-4, having rapid disease progression (~4 days), showed a number of strongly upregulated cytokine signaling genes. These results suggest that if tissues were investigated earlier in disease progression, gene expression might reveal more insights into pathogenesis based on original pulmonary insult. This is similar to findings that early death (≤3 days) is related to the condition precipitating ARDS. 13 In addition, −ARDS-2, −ARDS-3, and +ARDS-4 samples contained various pathogens, yet each had a bacterial component to their infection. Although it is outside the scope of this discussion to attempt to detail the host response to individual pathogen components or to use microarrays as a hypothesis-generating discovery tool (considering our sample size), it is believed that as samples are added to create a respiratory pathogen compendium, a more comprehensive view of ARDS progression at the genetic level would be able to supersede current characterization of ARDS at the clinical level.

Antibiotic exposure and low microbiome diversity have been increasingly recognized as important risk factors for poor transplant outcomes including GVHD and bacterial infection [3, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 40] . The potential adverse impact of antibiotic exposure on transplant outcomes is further highlighted by a recent randomized trial in which azithromycin prophylaxis given for 2 years post-transplantation resulted in worse airflow decline-free survival and higher rates of hematologic relapse when compared with placebo [7] . Altered microbiota induced by antibiotic use may play a role in immune modification and transplant outcomes [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Interestingly, rates of disease progression to LRTD vary widely from 5% to 55% for PIV, RSV, and MPV, depending on surveillance measures and transplant centers [23, 24, 41] . These findings raise the question of whether different antibiotic practices between transplant centers may be an important reason for the observed differences in progression rates. The epidemiological link observed in the current study may provide rationale to further probe the impact of microbiota on transplant outcomes including respiratory viral disease progression. This premise is consistent with recently published data showing that the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria is negatively correlated with respiratory viral disease progression [42] . When transplant outcomes are evaluated in future studies of antimicrobial de-escalation strategies, different antibiotic utilization strategies or other strategies modifying the microbiome, respiratory disease progression could be assessed as an important endpoint.",28.120608171549584,12.77365411942651

This article has discussed how global gene expression studies have be used to detail the global relationship between antagonism of host antiviral responses during severe fulminant RNA viral infection and how selective tissue sampling considerations can be developed to better characterize the activation of inflammatory cascades and the development of severe pathology. As the importance of immune cell activation, killing and immunopathology become more prominent, isolation of infected and/or immune cells from infected tissue or blood samples using FACS or LCM as a method to isolate specific cell populations for genomics analysis should become more widely used. Discovery-based genomics approaches can aid in identifying the host response pathways associated with immunopathology and contribute to a more detailed understanding of how global host responses are regulated during viral infection that will be critical for the development of novel antiviral treatments. Thus, an important goal for developing new antiviral therapies is the development of multi-target approaches that both inhibit viral enzymatic activities and limit the activation of deleterious immune responses associated with the development of immunopathology. While it may seem counter-intuitive to block host responses to infection, a limited and temporary inhibition of some host inflammatory response could provide additional protection against the development of severe disease pathology and improve clinical outcome. The strength of genomics-based approaches lies in their ability to characterize the global effects of infection and to serve as a discovery-based tool to identify new host response components and pathways for further study, which may ultimately lead to novel targets of therapeutic intervention.",31.89455242133458,12.216513673580803

In fact, laboratory diagnosis of communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) is so poor that current clinical practice guidelines do not recommend testing for all but the most severely affected patients and advise use of empiric therapy. 1 This pragmatic approach fails to address issues of antimicrobial overuse and resistance, public health surveillance, and advancement of medical knowledge.",22.479435702403883,8.798263724480245

As our knowledge of diseases quickly expands, the field of disease marker discovery will play increasingly important roles in the delivery of improved diagnosis and treatment. These markers, such as protein (including autoantibodies, which are antibodies specific to self-antigens [43] ), hormonal markers (such as lack of insulin in Type I diabetic patients [89] ), and genetic/genomic markers (such as BRCA1 mutation in breast cancer patients [52] ), enable clinicians to diagnose the disease while it is still at early stages, to ensure appropriate surgical intervention, efficient drug treat-ment and monitoring, and to predict an individual's risk of developing specific diseases before they experience symptoms. Traditionally, discovery and detection of these disease markers relied on low throughput technologies such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) or 2D-gel plus Edman degradation for protein markers, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for mRNA markers, and restriction enzyme digestion, cloning and Sanger sequencing for DNA markers. Before the dawn of high-throughput technologies these methods played important roles in marker identification and yielded significant discoveries in various diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis and breast cancer [32, 52, 107] , which greatly enhanced the diagnostic efficiency in these diseases.",24.878977523740577,8.41530121505137

For example, in Indonesia, while earlier commencement of oseltamivir treatment is associated with improved survival, even treatment within the first 4 days of disease is not a guarantee of survival and is still associated with a 42% mortality 94 . Alternative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. The first step towards this is to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the lung pathology associated with human H5N1 disease and how it differs from seasonal influenza. Here, we have reviewed data that suggests that the innate immune response may be both friend and foe. This points to possibilities of novel therapeutic interventions that deserve further investigation. Preliminary data suggests that the differences in host responses induced by H5N1 appear to be similar to those of seasonal H1N1, albeit of greater intensity 83 but more systematic studies using gene expression profiling and proteomic studies to address this question are warranted. It is relevant to also investigate whether biomarkers that provide early indication of a poor prognosis can be identified to guide such immunomodulatory interventions. It is particularly interesting that targeting some signalling pathways that are associated with inflammation (e.g. the RAF-MEK-ERK kinase cascade, NF-κB activation) can also block viral replication 95 .

In some strains, young (6-10 week) mice are completely resistant to disease, remaining without signs of disease even in the absence of Type 1 interferon signaling, while others are highly sensitive [31] . Aged mice of all strains are susceptible to disease, mimicking the age-dependent susceptibility observed in humans. SARS-CoV-infected mice have been useful for identifying host genes important in pathogenesis. Studies with mouse adapted SARS-CoV showed that more severe disease was characterized by inefficient immune activation, such as reduced expression of MHCII, CD86, accompanied by poor CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. Reversing inefficient activation of innate immune cells in mice using TLR ligands such as poly I-C or by depleting inhibitory alveolar macrophages using clodronate liposomes rescued mice from lethal disease [47] . These interventions resulted in enhanced migration of dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes and consequent development of a protective T cell response and enhanced kinetics of virus clearance.

The protective and deleterious human response to MERS-CoV remains to be determined. Pneumonia and multiorgan involvement is a common feature in patients with MERS. 32 The high mortality seen in MERS-CoV could be attributed to acute lung injury, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 33 ARDS is associated with leaky alveolar-capillary interfaces with pulmonary oedema, hypoxia, polymorphonuclear leucocytic or lymphocytic cells with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gamma interferon and an aberrant immune response, which results in further tissue damage and deterioration of lung function. Sixty percent of MERS patients with acute lung injury or ARDS either recover after receiving intensive care and 40% of MERS patients succumb to the disease. 34 A large majority of patients who die due to infection with MERS-CoV may have some form of immunosuppression due to old age or having co-morbid conditions (diabetes, chronic lung, renal, cardiac or liver disease or have an underlying immunosuppressive condition). 35 It appears that the outcome of MERS patients may represent a precarious balance of both host-and MERS-CoV-induced immune signaling events. 36 It is not known whether mortality is a reflection of an ineffective host response to MERS-CoV or whether an aberrant host immune response contributes to pathogenesis and poor prognosis. Interventions that could manipulate this hostpathogen relationship via modulation of the host response to MERS-CoV infection may help improve mortality rates in patients with MERS. 37 For instance, genome analysis suggest that immune signaling modulation may affect outcome, 38 and adenosine deaminase may prevent MERS-CoV entry into host cells. 39 A range of Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) have the potential for improving the treatment outcomes of severe lung infections. 40 ",29.18601998628988,12.847295625305524

The balance between protective and pathogenic immune responses is critical (Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010) . A pivotal role in this balance is played by innate immune effectors that detect the presence of viral products by pattern recognition receptors, thus initiating the host response (Iwasaki, 2012) . The specific cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators produced in response to immune activation, as well as downstream adaptive responses that themselves can modulate the innate response, can skew the relative balance between aggressive responses that rapidly clear infection and responses that minimize the extent of immunopathology. Exuberant innate immune activation can also play a direct role in precipitating host organ tissue damage (Cameron et al., 2008; Kuiken et al., 2012) .",31.03442127684173,12.010978342223128

In parallel, chronic productive cough is an important clinical manifestation of bronchiectasis and the first recognised symptom in many cases antecedent to a confirmatory diagnosis [1, 16, 19] . Given its central importance in the diagnosis and pathology of bronchiectasis, a clearer understanding of its mechanistic underpinnings is desirable. The importance of cough in bronchiectasis is illustrated by implementation of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ); a measure of cough symptoms that has been validated in bronchiectasis and correlates with disease severity reflecting the underlying association between cough and disease progression [20] . More recent evidence corroborates this finding, highlighting objectively monitored cough frequency as an important predictor of sputum production and exacerbations (though not lung function) in bronchiectasis [21] . Indeed, such is the importance of cough, specifically cough hypersensitivity, that it has been advanced as a 'treatable trait' of bronchiectasis and proposed as a potential target of individualised therapies to alleviate cough in particularly symptomatic individuals [3, 10] . Therapies such as use of antitussives, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or chest physiotherapy may therefore alleviate symptoms in individuals with problematic cough if appropriately targeted [10, 22] .

Because lymphocyte counts were found to be the critical risk factor for progression, we examined the effect of lymphocyte count changes on progression from URI to LRD to test whether progression to LRD was associated with increasing lymphocyte counts and thus a form of IRIS. The possibility of IRIS due to respiratory virus infection (5 patients with parainfluenza and 1 patient with RSV) has been reported in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients who presented with post-engraftment pneumonitis after HCT [26, 28] . However, we did not observe differences in lymphocyte engraftment dynamics between progressors and nonprogressors (Figure 2A and 2B) , suggesting that profound lymphopenia and the associated immune defect rather than an IRIS phenomenon is responsible for progression to LRD. RSV-specific antibodies play an important role in the prevention of RSV disease in young children [29, 30] . Palivizumab prophylaxis has been documented to prevent serious RSV disease in young children with underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease [31] but has shown only very limited success in treatment situations [6, 19, [32] [33] [34] [35] . In elderly immunocompetent persons, having RSV antibody level below 10 log 2 was associated with more hospitalization and ICU care [36] .

Another small retrospective analysis of palivizumab given for RSV URI did not show a beneficial effect [8, 10] .

The recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes may in fact be important in clearing an infection or disposing of cellular debris, but may also produce host damage (27) . Neutrophil in®ltration has been reported, for example, in liver during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced in¯ammation (27) . In our case, in®ltrations seem to be related directly to the immunizing potential of the antigen rather than to endotoxic shock, because, on the one hand, we tested the absence of LPS in the murine GST preparations used and, on the other hand, schistosomal, nonself-GST, prepared and administered under the same conditions, was unable to trigger both antigen-speci®c autoreactivity and neutrophil in®ltration. Treated mice, however, did not progress further and their health conditions remained normal even after repeated immunization with self-antigens and prolonged stabulation in good practice conditions, suggesting that other events are required to move to the next checkpoint in the progression of the autoimmune disease (7, 25) , related perhaps to pathogen infections or to other environmental factors. However, although treated animals were monitored for >6±8 months, it should be considered that the clinical signs of autoimmunity may follow the appearance of antibodies by a considerable length of time, thus suggesting that observation of immunized mice should be prolonged to the entire lifespan of the animals. Studies by Matesic et al.

Emily Gurley highlighted that the individuals exposed to infectious virus contaminating date palm sap have a shorter incubation period and more rapid disease progression compared to patients infected through person-to-person transmission, and that their diagnosis generally occurs only on the day of death, under the best possible circumstances (case fatality ratio -CFR of approximately 90% by this exposure route). Therapeutic intervention may be feasible in cases acquired by person-to-person transmission, with longer incubation times, slower evolution to severe disease, and earlier diagnosis (by a few days), which all improve the prospects for survival (approximately 50% CFR with person-to-person transmission), and opportunities for antiviral treatment. In addition to effective antivirals, rapid diagnostics were the highest priority on Emily Gurley's wish list as they are much needed to be able to initiate treatment (when a good treatment is one day available) and infection control interventions earlier. She concluded that, ultimately, mitigating the pandemic risk associated with NiV will require a combined approach that includes prophylactic measures, such personal protective equipment for the care of patients, implementation of sound infection control measures, improved surveillance and education, vaccines for at-risk individuals (such as healthcare workers and those that consume date palm sap), and cost-effective, shelf-stable and easy to administer antivirals.",29.841086430664962,12.929563376467065

Identification of reliable disease markers may enable the design of targeted therapies, as well as approaches to predict clinical behavior of affected tissues in a pathologically indistinguishable (but perhaps biologically diverse and heterogeneous) patient population. These issues are particularly important in considering malignant diseases. Until recently, approaches to cancer biomedicine have relied on empirical tissue culture and animal models. Both, the lack of validated molecular profiles indicative of an aggressive cancer phenotype and the absence of validated intermediate endpoints have made tumors difficult to diagnose and manage despite the occasional availability of serum markers along with pathological grade and clinical staging. Without reliable ways of forecasting which tumors will progress, in many cases cancers have been treated aggressively on the chance of cure, but often at the price of potentially severe treatment-associated toxicity. There is a clear need for identification of improved biomarkers of both tumor progression and metastasis potential and mechanisms in cancer. The characterization of molecular diversity in cancer is essential for the development of targeted therapies [3, 8, 9] . Ultimately, it may be possible to personalize the guiding of imaging or therapeutic compounds to tumor or to vascular targets in cancer patients [6] .

Reported rates of infection and progression to lower respiratory tract disease vary by virus, and are in part dependent on viral detection methodology and study design. Table 1 summarizes data from prospective and large retrospective published studies of RVIs among HCT recipients in the last 10 years, and Figure 1 provides cumulative incidence estimates from a recent prospective study in allogeneic HCT recipients [22] . In general, rates of progression to lower respiratory tract infection and deaths attributable to infection have decreased compared with earlier studies from the previous decade. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial, including less immunosuppressive transplant regimens, improved supportive care, more sensitive diagnostics, and early treatment strategies. For example, some studies did not report pneumonia or progression to pneumonia with influenza or RSV, but did specifically note that early diagnosis and treatment of upper respiratory tract infection appeared to be effective in preventing lower tract disease [13, 16] .",24.22612949592575,10.117509844242996

Labelled DNA from a sample is hybridised to the array and those probes which are complementary to the DNA in the sample are detected by a fluorescent marker or other signal. Sequencespecific probes have been used in a variety of methods including northern blot, southern blot, and in situ hybridisation. A key advantage in its use for surveillance is the ability to analyse thousands of targets simultaneously which may be in a sample (Bryant et al., 2004) . They can be used for multiplex pathogen detection (Palka-Santini et al., 2009 ) and also for gene expression studies (Schena et al., 1995; Greeff et al., 2016) . Different platforms are available commercially including Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA), Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA), Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) and Alere (Jena, Germany). These platforms can be distinguished by the type of surface substrate, probe length and the spotting and labelling techniques. In addition to the use of multiplex PCR or microarrays to detect individual or mixed pathogen infections, they can also be used to monitor the host response to infection using expression assays in which cellular RNA is converted to cDNA and amplified for detection or followed by application to a microarray. The patterns of gene expression associated with individual cellular damage or initiation of the early immune response may indicate the type of pathology, and by extension the types of pathogen involved. Molecular methods can therefore be used to monitor the presence of the pathogen and the host response in endemic production disease; these are very powerful tools. Many studies have shown their consistency and utility in the diagnosis of infectious diseases in pigs, for example the detection of Porcine Circovirus (PCV) in clinical specimens from diarrhoeic pigs (Jiang et al., 2010) . Other studies have reported results using the Virochip, a panviral DNA microarray that is able to detect all known viruses and has been used to simultaneously identify Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV), Influenza A virus and Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus in clinical serum samples (Nicholson et al., 2011) .",23.793930151203327,9.429166172294485

By 30 Mar, India had reported 1,251 cases and 32 deaths. 3 The spread of any epidemic depends on infectivity of the pathogen and the available susceptible population. For a novel infection, when disease dynamics are still unclear, mathematical modeling estimates the number of cases in worst and best-case scenarios. It can also help estimate the effect of preventive measures adopted against COVID-19. With Suppressive strategies, the aim is to maintain the effective Reproduction number (R) below 01, to prevent further spread of infection, while in a Mitigation strategy, the aim is to blunt the effect of the epidemic. 4 Non-Pharmacological interventions (NPIs) utilized to contain epidemics (Social distancing, closure of schools, universities and offices, avoidance of mass gatherings, community-wide containment etc.) may be applied to the general population, contacts of cases (Contact tracing, Surveillance, quarantine) and the cases themselves (Early Reporting, Isolation). 4, 5 India appears to be in early stages of the epidemic.

The inflammatory response begins with the initial recognition of a pathogen, which then mediates immune cell recruitment, eliminates pathogens, and ultimately results in tissue repair and return to homeostasis. However, certain viruses such as highly pathogenic CoVs, IAV, and ebola viruses induce excessive and prolonged cytokine/ chemokine response known as Bcytokine storms,^which results in high morbidity and mortality due to immunopathology. Although studies reviewed in this manuscript provide evidence that Bcytokine storms^and immunopathology can occur during pathogenic hCOV infections, we do not yet have a sufficient understanding of the specific factor/s responsible for exuberant inflammatory responses. Studies from human autopsies and animal models strongly suggest a pathogenic role for inflammatory cytokines/chemokines derived from IMM and neutrophils. Therefore, therapeutic interventions targeting these pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines could prove beneficial in ameliorating undesirable inflammatory responses. Additionally, since high virus titers at early and later stages of infection strongly correlate with disease severity in humans, strategies directed at controlling viral load as well as attenuating the inflammatory response might prove beneficial. Therefore, future studies should focus on identification of specific signaling pathways that mediate inflammatory responses in hCoV-infected patients and animals.

This is illustrated by the recommendations that have been made by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which contrast with earlier recommendations. 39, 40 On the basis of information that many cases in the Mexican epidemic had severe illness, the CDC initially recommended school closure as an option to lessen the risk of infection from a potentially severe disease. However, as estimates of severity were revised downward, recommendations were changed and the early identifi cation and isolation of ill students and staff became the primary method to reduce the spread of infl uenza in schools. 40 The use of stringent and costly measures such as school closure should indeed be based on age-specifi c estimates of severity and local morbidity indicators. It is important to emphasise again that the WHO phases are not an indication of severity (phase six only means that there is a sustained spread of the virus in diff erent continents); WHO now makes parallel statements on severity and geographical spread. 41, 42 School closure will of course not be the only intervention used in a pandemic; it should be considered in combination with other interventions that are available, such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other nonpharmaceutical interventions. Modelling suggests that, in certain circumstances, the combined eff ect of a set of interventions might be larger than the sum of the individual impacts. 28 This can happen when the diff erent interventions are complementary, targeting diff erent places or groups of individuals (eg, school closure and banning of mass gatherings and closure of selected workplaces). However, if the interventions target the same place or group of individuals, then the combined eff ect might be smaller than the sum of the individual impacts. For example, if children are vaccinated, the additional benefi ts gained by closing schools might be very small. These complexities mean that predicting the eff ect of combined interventions is challenging, and modelling has an important role in assessing likely impact. But it is important as new data become available on the eff ectiveness of individual interventions-such as the eff ect of school closure 14 -that model parameters and predictions are updated.",27.445564056912353,12.68704846791203

The occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was a transformative moment for the DRF. Clinical and experimental data demonstrated that the immune response to the SARS coronavirus contributed to the severity of this disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome occurred in young, previously healthy persons. This suggested that the pathogenesis of this syndrome differed from viral diseases that occur in infants and the elderly with weak immunity. The disease process in young persons with SARS was marked by intense pulmonary inflammation and hemorrhage due to immunological damage [7] .

Infection of aged, but not young, mice with recombinant viruses bearing spike glycoproteins derived from early human or palm civet isolates resulted in death accompanied by pathological changes associated with ARDS. In aged mice, a greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed than in young mice, whose responses were significantly delayed. Differences between lethal and nonlethal virus phenotypes in aged mice could be attributed to differences in host response kinetics rather than virus kinetics. SARS-CoV infection induced a range of interferon, cytokine, and pulmonary wound-healing genes, as well as several genes associated with the onset of ARDS. Mice that died also showed unique transcriptional profiles of immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and stress. Cytokines associated with ARDS were significantly upregulated in animals experiencing lung pathology and lethal disease, while the same animals experienced downregulation of the ACE2 receptor. These data suggest that the magnitude and kinetics of a disproportionately strong host innate immune response contributed to severe respiratory stress and lethality.

Potential therapeutic strategies to this problem have been discussed but the approaches with the most promise include: prevention of infection from occurring; anti-viral agents that eliminate infection while reducing the host's immune response; treatments that specifically target enhanced inflammatory responses that are induced during virus-induced asthma exacerbations and supplementation of protective anti-viral responses.

To overcome these limitations and best capture the antiviral landscape, transcriptomics of bronchial brush samples was performed.

The enrichment for a subset of these modules correlated directly with viral titers, identifying potential virus-dependent transcriptional networks. The gene sets comprising these modules were associated with immune-related processes, including inflammatory cytokine production and antiviral responses. Animals with severe disease outcomes were found to diverge from those with mild disease by having weak activation of these modules early during infection, followed by strong activation at later points during infection.

This cytokine secretion persisted in patients with severe viral pneumonia and was directly associated with the degree of viral replication in the respiratory tract. Cytokines play important roles in the antiviral defense, but persistent hypercytokinemia may cause inflammatory tissue damage and participate in the genesis of the respiratory failure observed in these patients.

The introduction of the pathogen in a diseasefree population always leads to an epidemic when most infections are severe. But if the population is not much fragmented, the impact of the pathogen rapidly decreases. This is because the pathogen circulates so that young animals are infected while they are still partly protected, develop an attenuated disease and activate their immune system. Only sporadic deaths from the severe disease are observed. In contrast, in highly fragmented populations, the pathogen rapidly fades out locally. Once re-introduced into the subpopulation, individuals are not protected and several cases of the disease can be observed in the same locality. The aggregation of severe disease cases occurs with a simultaneous increase in their frequency so that the severe disease (re-)emerges in the population. One important question is whether the increase in severe disease frequency of the pathogen is followed by an important increase in its impact in the long term? Our model indicates that it is and allows us to define important factors that could modulate the increased impact of disease in relation to fragmentation. The most important factor is certainly the level of mortality induced by the mild form of the disease, because the prevalence of the mild form of the disease largely decreases during the course of the fragmentation process. Another important factor is the capacity of the parasite to circulate intensively (i.e. to provide regular intense exposure to the young animals) in a situation where the pathogen is locally more persistent. For this reason, the transmission rates of severe and mild diseases and the susceptibility of young individuals are critical factors. Finally, the parasite needs to persist at a scale where the rate of parasite exchange between individuals is high. This requires a high persistence of the parasite that may be achieved in several ways. For example, the distribution of the infectious period (Keeling & Grenfell 1997; Anderson & Britton 2000; Lloyd 2001a,b) , the host spatial structure (Bolker & Grenfell 1995; Park et al. 2002) , the birth rate (Swinton et al. 1998 ) and the transmission rate of the parasite (Swinton et al. 1998; Anderson & Britton 2000) are all the well-known factors that can greatly influence the persistence of a parasite in its host population.",28.466201893251487,11.60879182827122

As a consequence, the proportion of young animals that do not carry maternal protection increases locally and so the re-introduction of the parasite results in an increasing proportion of deaths from the severe disease (figure 3c). In summary, at the beginning of the fragmentation process, deaths from the disease are rare. The parasite is present in every subpopulation and so most young are in contact with the parasite. Non-exposure during early life is more a matter of bad luck than a question of spatial localization. Deaths from the severe form of the disease are rare and diffuse in the entire population without spatial aggregation. The severe form of the disease can remain undetected over very long periods, especially if the host species is not intensively monitored. In contrast, at an advanced stage of the fragmentation process, deaths from the severe disease are mainly due to local epidemics. Therefore, frequently a large proportion of the individuals from a subpopulation die over a short period. The local density of dead individuals can be very high, increasing the probability of discovering the severe disease.",27.453987787430712,11.324640438549547

In recent work, a reductionist approach has proved very productive to identify single host factors that modulate viral pathogenesis. What we have learned from these many studies is that there is a delicate balance between the host response to infection that protects us from disease and the imbalance that can occur that can cause more disease. The ability to simultaneously investigate diverse pathways using transcriptomics, proteomics and diverse mouse strains allows for a broader appreciation of the interconnectivity of the host response to disease. These new techniques also allow for precise understanding of how the response to infection can be modulated at other pathways outside of what we knew before and potentially at specific nodes of cross regulation such that a single therapeutic intervention could modulate multiple pathways to benefit the host. Through all of the systems biology approaches, the key link is the ability to model how the intertwined host response to infection combines into the induction of proteins that attempt to inhibit viral infection. The paradigm of multi-pathway analysis now exists to compare across viruses, hosts and routes of infection, how disease is initiated, how it differs between variables and how all of these factors can point the research into targeted therapies for broad ranges of viral infections.",32.38296224107015,14.283918868505793

Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are major innate leukocytes that orchestrate protective immunity to viral lung infections. However, a dysregulated cytokine response can promote excessive infiltration and robust pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils and monocytemacrophages, leading to fatal disease. Following virus infection, the beneficial or deleterious role of infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages is determined largely by their ability to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A majority of studies use the total number of infiltrating cells and their activation status as measures to demonstrate their role during an infection. Consequently, the ability of neutrophils and Inflammatory Monocyte Macrophages (IMMs) to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and its correlation with the disease severity, is not well defined. In this chapter, we report useful markers to identify lung infiltrating innate immune cells and define their activation status.

The author anticipates that treatment with statins would inhibit MyD88 signaling and downstream NF-κB responses, predicting an inhibition of inflammatory responses that would lead to improved disease outcomes in MERS patients. Although there is a linkage in MERS and SARS patient samples between aberrant signaling of interferon-stimulated genes or cytokines and severe coronavirus-induced disease, innate immune signaling is still required for an effective immune response that results in less severe disease following coronavirus infection (9, 10). While testing drugs like statins that are already know to be safe for human use is an attractive concept, there is no evidence that the combination of attenuated MyD88 and NF-κB signaling would improve disease outcome compared to the outcome using NF-κB-inhibiting drugs, which do increase survival in mouse models of SARS-CoV infection (11).

Therefore, assessment of CNS protection must be partnered with assessments of CNS-infiltrating immune cells and proliferation of immune cells in the periphery to determine how pharmacological agents affect disease mechanisms.",28.238477610092193,13.71005472132493

Golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a genetically homologous model that has been used increasingly to study pathogenesis and potential treatments for DMD. GRMD dogs develop cardiomyopathy similar to DMD, but the disease progression has not been well defined. In this study, we evaluated echocardiography and cardiac MRI in 24 adult GRMD dogs at different ages. Left heart systolic function, wall thickness, and myocardial strain were assessed with echocardiography. Features evaluated with cardiac MRI included LV function, chamber size, myocardial mass, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Separately, ten GRMD dogs were evaluated with circumferential strain twice in a 12‐month period. Taken together, our results showed gradual decline of systolic function in GRMD dogs. The decrease of ejection fraction (EF) in echocardiography correlated well with age and identified 31 months as the approximate age at which EF falls below 55%. Circumferential strain appeared to be more sensitive than EF in early disease detection and declined with disease progression. Evidence of LV chamber dilatation provided proof of dilated cardiomyopathy. The LGE imaging showed LV lateral wall lesions and earlier involvement of the anterior septum in GRMD dogs. In conclusion, this study showed the natural history of GRMD cardiomyopathy largely parallels that of DMD.

Firstly, an increase in the viral loads as disease progresses could be an important factor. Despite limited evidence about the viral shedding kinetics of MERS-CoV over the disease course, it is expected that viral load increases with disease progression up to a point [21]. Therefore, it seems plausible that close contacts in Hospital B were exposed to a higher infective dose than those in Hospital A. In addition, worsening respiratory symptoms and the consequent need for respiratory procedures during the later stage of disease could facilitate viral transmission [2223]. Since the index case received nebulizer therapy in a six-bed room, aerosols generated by the nebulizer might amplify viral transmission to those who shared the room in Hospital B. The shorter incubation period and rapid disease progression among secondary cases in Hospital B are consistent with these explanations. In contrast, individuals in Hospital A might have been exposed to different levels of viral loads depending on when and for how long they were exposed during the disease progression in the first week of illness of the index case. These differences in exposure can partly explain the wide range of incubation periods and diverse clinical features among secondary cases in Hospital A. Secondly, underlying comorbidities in secondary cases can affect the explosive nature of transmission and the clinical consequences. Given that the index patient was hospitalized in the pulmonary ward in Hospital B, a large proportion of affected patients had underlying pulmonary diseases. This comorbidity combined with a high infective dose could exacerbate the disease progression, resulting in the high mortality among secondary cases in Hospital B.",26.58218564749083,9.727345674638821

Although authorities differ in their advocacy for a variety of treatment protocols, it is likely that the success of therapeutic intervention in KD is due to modulation of the causes and/or propagators of inflammation. As such we have re-evaluated the current prescriptive approach to the management of KD in the light of the published literature, adding corticosteroids into primary therapy for severe and IVIG unresponsive cases; and suggesting a role for anti-TNF- α if systemic inflammation persists despite IVIG, aspirin and corticosteroids. Repeated protocol-driven administration of IVIG in patients with little evidence of clinical and/or laboratory improvement may be detrimental, and treatment with corticosteroids and/or anti-TNFα considered. Unchecked inflammation damages the vasculature in KD; the acute-phase response, particularly CRP, combined with clinical response can be used to assess the efficacy of any intervention. A minimum of three echocardiograms should be performed in the first 6 weeks of the illness. The justification for this is: (1) some patients (albeit a minority) can develop CAA in the first week of the illness,6 and early detection of these should prompt more aggressive primary management; (2) early echocardiography (in the first week) may detect extracoronary manifestations, such as mitral regurgitation or pericardial effusion, that may be associated with increased risk of CAA62 (3) early detection of CAA progression and/or development of thrombus might be detected that could result in intensification of anti-inflammatory and/or additional anticoagulation therapy.

In addition, the short elimination half-life of XKB may negatively affect its concentration at the site of action and compromise the therapeutic effect in clinical practice. Therefore, these findings provide clues for further XKB-based drug development and clinical use, including structural modification or nanotechnology-based formulations to minimize or avoid its potential side effects and prolong its elimination half-life to achieve therapeutic concentrations at the site of action.",24.57829413101576,9.863993542889014

Consistent with transcriptomic distance analysis, IAVs induced few transcriptomic changes at 3 and 7 hpi (Fig. 3A). At 12 hpi, the response to H3N2 infection was quite robust, with 1,631 DE genes, while there were only 824 DE genes after H7N9 infection and 580 and 331 for H7N7 and H5N1, respectively. At 24 hpi, all IAVs induced a drastic host response, with the number of DE genes ranging from 5,187 genes for H3N2 to 10,637 genes for H5N1 and 11,413 genes for H7N7. With 6,618 DE genes for H7N9 at 24 hpi, the amplitude of the host response to H7N9 at 24 hpi was closer to that for human than that for avian IAV (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we observed a more progressive host response to human H3N2 infection, whereas avian IAVs delayed the host response until 24 hpi, when a massive dysregulation of the host response was observed. The response to H7N9 was characterized by a number of DE genes intermediate between those of avian and human IAVs.",24.116617645772852,9.590655246459836

This also suggests that the host cell receptor, if a protein, is sufficiently similar between humans and bats to facilitate direct transmission. Bats are recognized as key reservoirs for viruses, including several coronaviruses and henipaviruses, such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus (5). In all cases, bats do not appear to develop clinical disease, but disease is severe when viruses cross over to infect human populations. This is analogous to the situation in humans and sooty mangabeys infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), respectively: sooty mangabeys infected with SIV do not develop significant disease, whereas HIV is fatal in humans (10). A critical question is why bats are “tolerant” of infections such as HCoV-EMC or SARS-CoV. How do they clear the virus without developing immunopathological disease? If coronavirus-infected bats are similar to SIV-infected sooty mangabeys, infection may not activate the host immune response to the same extent as it does in humans. Understanding how bats respond to the infection may provide insight into how specific aspects of the human immune response result in clinical disease.

Biomarkers, molecules that can be sensitively measured in the human body, are by definition potentially diagnostic. The efficacy of biomarkers to infectious diseases lies in their capability to provide early detection, establish highly specific diagnosis, determine accurate prognosis, direct molecular-based therapy and monitor disease progression (5). They are increasingly important in both therapeutic and diagnostic processes, with high potential to guide preventive interventions. Vast resources have been devoted to identifying and developing biomarkers that can help determine the treatments for patients. Furthermore, there is growing consensus that multiple markers will be required for most diagnoses, while single markers may serve in only selected cases. Despite intensified interest and research, however, the rate of development of novel biomarkers has been falling (6), suggesting that a resource that leverages existing data is overdue. At present the databases containing information about biomarkers are focused predominantly on cancer: early detection research network (7), gastric cancer knowledgebase (8), integrated cancer biomarker information system (9) and database for cancer, asthma and autism for children's study (10).

Further, this work demonstrates that targeted assays measuring peptides involved in this response allow classification of ARV infection with a high degree of accuracy. Validation of these findings across independent experimentally infected Influenza A and human rhinovirus cohorts suggests a robust and generalized response to viral infection. With further development as a clinical diagnostic, this signature may have utility in rapid screening for emerging infections, avoidance of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, and more rapid implementation of appropriate therapeutic and public health strategies.

During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2014–2016, thousands of people were infected and many of them died due to the viral infection [1]. EVD is generally considered as an endemic disease in Africa. However, its spread can be broadened through travel to all parts of the world. It is known to be transmitted from humans, bats, rodents, and chimpanzees to humans. Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family [2]. Ebola virus has a negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 different proteins and is surrounded by an envelope that contains the virally expressed glycoprotein (GP). There are five species of Ebola virus including, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, all of which were named after the places where they were first discovered [3]. Ebola virus GP is associated with viral attachment to the host cell receptor prior to viral entry into the cells [45]. To date, neutralizing antibodies targeting Ebola virus GP have been reported to be somewhat effective at reducing the severity of Ebola virus infection and disease progression in animal models and humans. For example, when Ebola virus-infected monkeys were treated within 24 hours following Ebola virus challenge with ZMAb (composed of three monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] against Ebola virus GP), all survived from Ebola virus infection, while all monkeys without ZMAb treatment died within five days of viral infection [67] Furthermore, ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) treatment is known to be effective at reducing mortality rates in patients infected with Ebola virus [8]. Despite the severity of Ebola virus infection, there are currently neither preventive vaccines nor therapeutic drugs readily available for use. Thus, development of vaccines or more effective drugs against Ebola viral infection is highly demanding.",17.39191180854462,8.512483601135987

Etoposide and dexamethasone form the mainstay of the initial treatment, including patients with EBV-associated HLH [14], and this has been confirmed in the long-term analysis of the HLH-2004 study [15]. The administration of etoposide in our patient was difficult due to the severe hepatic dysfunction, thus we chose our initial therapy with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins [16], with an intent to start etoposide within a 4-week window [17]. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms, inflammation and EBV viral load in patients with EBV-associated HLH [18]. Our patient continued to deteriorate, and the therapeutic decision was to start anti-IL-1 therapy, anakinra versus the anti-CD52 targeting monoclonal antibody, alemtuzumab. Both agents have been used in the refractory setting [19,20]. The management of HLH in her case posed several diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Despite making a diagnosis, the toxicity profile of the proposed interventions was considerable. Additionally, the patient has the competing risks of mortality from her underlying malignancy, severe infective complications and multiorgan failure. With increasing use of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic regimens for the management of advanced malignancies, it is likely that there will be increasing recognition of HLH in patients with solid organ malignancy and increased awareness and further research on best therapeutic approach to reduce the high mortality rate.

In addition to constant seasonal outbreaks, highly pathogenic avian influenza 45 (HPAI) strains, such as H5N1, remain an ongoing pandemic threat with recent WHO figures showing 46 454 confirmed laboratory infections and a mortality rate of 53%. It is important to note that humans 47 have very little pre-existing immunity towards avian influenza virus strains. Moreover, there is no 48 commercially available human H5N1 vaccine. Given the potential for H5N1 viruses to trigger a 49 pandemic (1, 2), there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic interventions to combat known 50 deficiencies in our ability to control outbreaks. Current seasonal influenza virus prophylactic and 51 therapeutic strategies involve the use of vaccination and antivirals. Vaccine efficacy is highly variable 52 as evidenced by a particularly severe 2017/18 epidemic and frequent re-formulation of the vaccine is 53 required to combat ongoing mutations in the influenza virus genome. In addition, antiviral resistance 54 has been reported for many circulating strains, including the avian influenza H7N9 virus that emerged 55 in 2013 (3, 4) . Influenza A viruses have also been shown to target and hijack multiple host cellular 56 pathways to promote survival and replication (5, 6). As such, there is increasing evidence to suggest 57 that targeting host pathways will influence virus replication, inflammation, immunity and pathology (6, 58 7). Alternative intervention strategies based on modulation of the host response could be used to 59 supplement the current prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. 60",29.73471924122636,13.1767709966477

Once damage is inflicted, lung cells trigger a host response which can include inflammation, matrix remodeling and different forms of cell death, including apoptosis (1) . Although a limited host response may help to clear the injurious agent and repair lung tissue (2) , an overexuberant host response can lead to severe injury and impairment in gas exchange. Therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed to limit lung damage and interference with lung repair are important. Lungs are exposed to mechanical load during every breath. In pathologic conditions, generation of the pressure gradients necessary for ventilation may cause an excessive cell stretch and lead to organ dysfunction. This is especially relevant during mechanical ventilation with high pressures, which can lead to the so-called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (3, 4) . In mechanically ventilated patients , a strategy aimed to limit VILI decreased mortality in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (5) .",27.77138203146508,12.706423165568289

Important for the current debate about the natural history of the disease, this policy would also work if there is a fraction of asymptomatic but infectious individuals in the population. Our results also show that from a practical point of view, a combination of all the analyzed contexts can have second order benefits. As already stressed, containment measures should not only be directed towards a full cutdown of the number of infected cases. Their efficacy is also given by other factors, such as delaying, even if only by a few days, the spreading of the disease. Such delays are always good for preparedness and to have more time for clinical research that can lead to new pharmacological treatments or vaccines. For instance, even if traffic restrictions are not effective on their own, they facilitate the control of the population and thus it would be easier to detect infected individuals and treat them. Similarly, self-protection measures and other social-distancing practices delay the spreading of the disease, freeing resources that would allow for a better management of the epidemic, in turn leading to an increase of the efficacy of individual isolation. Closing public places would, in practice, reduce the transmission, which again will lower the total number of infections and thus make them more manageable for the public health system. This also highlights the importance of having a coordinated response system, since simply adopting central measures like imposing mobility restrictions and closing public places is not effective in the middle-to-long term.",22.2996061829498,8.369058638882606

It is observed that the reduction of mobility due to the confinement of the population has a highly nonlinear effect on the reduction of the epidemic. This makes the task of policy makers notoriously difficult, as they need to design realistic, implementable, confinement measures that reduce the impact of the epidemic sufficiently within the shortest time frame possible. If the interventions planned are too weak, the epidemic will not cease and the surge capacity of healthcare systems will be surpassed, leaving many individuals requiring hospitalization out of the attention they need. Furthermore, once policy makers realize the insufficiency of the interventions put in place, the epidemic may have spread up to a point such that only the most severe interventions will be of real use. On the other side, implementing very strict confinement measures from an early stage would give governments a much needed time to prepare against the attack of the disease, but would most likely take a huge toll in the economy, and consequently, in the population.",19.240847100368978,7.5889353782863855
