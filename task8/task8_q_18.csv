Again, HCoV-229E is more closely related to their relatives in camels as compared to those in bats, indicating a probability of camels being intermediate hosts between bats and humans [14, 57] . Human coronavirus NL63 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor for infection of target cells similar to SARS-CoV [20] and has been found to be able to replicate in swine cells in vitro [58] . No antibodies to HCoV-NL63 were found in any of the pigs tested in the present study as evidence of the fact that the ability to replicate in swine cells does not imply capability to infect an actual animal since several other barriers need to be surmounted for this to happen. Based on the results of the present study it may be concluded that cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine may not be intermediate hosts for HCoV-NL63. However, there have not been any reports of HCoV-NL63-related viruses circulating in Ghanaian bats, and as such, a spillover opportunity may not be present, and hence no likely infection.

We propose that multiple processes can lead to similar spatial and temporal patterns in prevalence and seroprevalence data, and, to our knowledge, existing empirical data often are insufficient to identify the underlying mechanisms. We encourage researchers to collect appropriate data to identify the scenarios driving pulses of excretion of emerging bat viruses because strategies to predict or reduce spillover risk should depend on the mechanisms' underlying dynamics (Table 1) . Current management strategies include dispersing bats, culling bats, preventing contact between bats and spillover hosts, or vaccinating spillover hosts [80, 81] . With the exception of equine vaccination for Hendra virus, few data exist on the efficacy of these strategies. Simulations combined with knowledge of bat virus dynamics can be used to assess the relative effectiveness of each strategy and identify situations in which management action may be counterproductive. For example, culling bats may decrease spillover risk if transmission of the virus increases as population size increases (SIR dynamics), whereas culling may increase spillover risk if pulses are driven by viral reactivation after stress (SILI dynamics). Dispersing bat colonies has clear potential for unintended consequences if pulses are driven by recolonization (SIR dynamics) or by viral reactivation (SILI dynamics). Predicting pulses driven by SIR, SIRS, or SILI dynamics may require information on herd immunity, withinand between-group transmission, and environmental stress, respectively.

We focus on the host-pathogen dynamics of four emerging viruses associated with bats: Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, and Marburg viruses. Spillover of bat infections to humans and domestic animals often coincides with pulses of viral excretion within bat populations, but the mechanisms driving such pulses are unclear. Three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections. First, pulses of viral excretion could reflect seasonal epidemic cycles driven by natural variations in population densities and contact rates among hosts. If lifelong immunity follows recovery, viruses may disappear locally but persist globally through migration; in either case, new outbreaks occur once births replenish the susceptible pool. Second, epidemic cycles could be the result of waning immunity within bats, allowing local circulation of viruses through oscillating herd immunity. Third, pulses could be generated by episodic shedding from persistently infected bats through a combination of physiological and ecological factors. The three scenarios can yield similar patterns in epidemiological surveys, but strategies to predict or manage spillover risk resulting from each scenario will be different. We outline an agenda for research on viruses emerging from bats that would allow for differentiation among the scenarios and inform development of evidence-based interventions to limit threats to human and animal health.

These efforts not only need to focus on preventing transmission from livestock (mostly cattle) to humans, but also, and in parallel, to reduce the prevalence of the disease in both domestic and wildlife species. The availability of improved diagnostic tools for ZTB in different species, as well as the implementation of disease monitoring, surveillance, and prevention strategies in livestock and wildlife species will be a crucial and much needed component to be able to implement comprehensive programs that will account for the complexities ZTB poses due to its zoonotic nature.

These complex spatial dynamics challenge prediction of localities at risk of rabies outbreaks; however, recent work has shown that genetic inference of vampire bat population structure can identify the future geographic pathways of ongoing epizootics .

Therefore, inferences must be drawn from multiple sources of indirect evidence. Bat viruses have been detected in urine, feces, saliva, and soiled fruit, indicating the potential for virus transmission via excreta between bats in the wild [5, 59] . However, under laboratory conditions, bat-to-bat transmission for most of these viruses is difficult to achieve (Table 2 ) [e.g., 32]. Following experimental inoculations, viral shedding by bats for both Nipah and Hendra viruses was minimal [25] , although continuous exposure to a low-dose viral rain may increase the probability of infection [5] . Natural and experimental vertical transmission of Hendra virus has been documented, but inconsistently and under specific conditions, such as parenteral inoculation (but not oronasal inoculation) [25, 29] . A few longitudinal serological and virological surveys and theoretical models have proposed that seasonal patterns in incidence or spillover could be explained by peaks of transmission in response to demographic or ecological drivers such as birth pulses, waning maternal immunity, and migration [12, 15, 60, 61] , but these proposed dynamics have not been confirmed.",42.71019688845344,16.203043345215256

Fortunately in this case, interventions should be directed to the human component of the system. The management involving human behaviour related to domestic animal management is more easily tractable [43] and might decrease successfully dog-to-dog and dog-to-wildlife disease transmission without relevant side effects.

Clearly, human activities that increase exposure to bats will increase the opportunity for infections to be transmitted between bats and humans or to intermediate hosts such as pets and livestock. However, our knowledge of how and why emerging pathogens spill over from bats is limited, and improved understanding of these processes will require cross-disciplinary approaches. Traits of the pathogen and the human-pathogen interactions at the cellular level, such as evolutionary mutation rates and receptorbinding affinity, are important when trying to understand spillover and emergence (Moya et al., 2004; Pulliam, 2008; Pulliam and Dushoff, 2009 ). However, these traits are proximate causes, and the ultimate drivers of spillover and emergence are ecological (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009) . Therefore, understanding host ecology and elements of the human-animal interface are essential in the context of pathogen spillover events. For example, host population structure and seasonality may affect the dynamics, viral diversity and virulence of infection in the host population, which may in turn affect the risk of spillover (Boots et al., 2004; Turmelle and Olival, 2009 ). Attempts to understand how host ecology impacts the dynamics of infection are relatively few in wild animal populations and fewer still for bat populations, and attempts at understanding how infections themselves evolve to persist in wildlife hosts with different ecologies are rarer still. To understand the role of host ecology in disease dynamics, we recommend combining field and experimental methods iteratively to parameterize mechanistic models, as well as integrative modelling in a comparative context, between species, population cohorts and pathogens (Plowright et al., 2008b; Plowright et al., 2011; George et al., 2011) ; important also in this context is the use of models to prioritize and plan field studies (Restif et al., in press) .

Using livestock as an example, lists of parasitic and infectious diseases have been compiled [80] and could be merged with reported host-parasite associations for ungulates (Cetartiodactyla plus Perissodactyla, minus cetaceans [28] ), which represent the group of terrestrial mammals most closely related to the major five livestock species: cows, goats, sheep, pigs, and horses. This information can then be used to distinguish gaps in the sampling of ungulate parasites and quantify the applicability of host phylogenetic affinities for predicting parasite sharing among ungulates. Factors influencing the transmission of infections among wild and domestic ungulates in Europe have already been identified [47] , and may help direct surveillance programs towards high risk areas. Models of infectious disease spread have been produced for parasites of some wild ungulate species, such as cervids of North America, which have informed management programs for limiting the prevalence and spread of multi-host parasites such as bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis which are also known to infect livestock [81] . Analyzing the environmental and anthropogenic factors that facilitate aggregations of wild ungulates (e.g. [82] ) could be used to infer previously undocumented reservoir interactions, or combined with landscape genetic techniques to estimate the degree of parasite transmission among these species, humans, livestock, or other domesticated animals. Monitoring overlaps in the distributions of livestock and related wildlife species and quantifying transmission of parasites between hosts may uncover multi-host transmission dynamics which can then be integrated with environmental and ecological data, and contemporary livestock transport networks to develop a continuously updating surveillance program that would help reduce the disease burden in livestock and improve the well-being of those reliant upon them.",43.26431209195387,16.658696596046845

Host shifts require not only that pathogens come in direct contact with the novel host but also that they have the capacity to infect and be transmitted by the new host (6, 7) . Contact depends on opportunities for the pathogen to leave the original host and gain access to a novel host and, because of this, is mitigated by the geographic ranges and ecologies of both the hosts and the pathogen (8) . For instance, exposure of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) to the myxoma virus during an eradication attempt in Australia in the mid-20th century was sufficient to allow for pathogen emergence, even though the virus' natural host is a South American leporid rabbit (Sylvagus brasiliensis) (9, 10) . Infectiousness and transmission, in contrast, will be determined primarily by pathogen and host genotypes (11, 12) . For example, humans have long been in contact with pathogens of Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata), which are traditional food items in China. Despite this, there had been no known host shifts from civets to humans until the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in 2002, then made possible by adaptive genetic changes in the virus' receptor binding domain (13, 14) . The extent to which hosts shifts are limited by opportunities for contact with novel hosts versus by fortuitous mutations that predispose the pathogen to infect the novel host remains, however, understudied despite the potential impacts on humans and livestock of host shifts by pathogens.",42.16272420394878,16.30029492624562

Nonetheless, the large population sizes of bats, hunting of bats as food sources, agricultural and livestock practices, and encroachment of humans upon bat habitat will likely lead to continued spillover events and outbreaks of disease [30, 31] . As is usual with reservoir/virus relationships, viruses must: (a) infect and persist in their bat hosts without causing substantial disease; (b) be transmitted to other susceptible hosts before the immune response eliminates the infection; or (c) the host dies from the infection [1] . For these reasons, many microbial agents, particularly viruses, have evolved immune-evasion strategies that manipulate the host response in a manner favorable to the virus [39] [40] [41] [42] . These immune evasion molecules, most of which are virally-encoded accessory proteins, also affect other species, such as humans, after spillover events. However, because the molecules are evolutionarily-optimized for the reservoir hosts, they likely behave differently in the nonreservoir hosts and may contribute to pathogenesis. Nearly all laboratory work examining immune-modulating proteins from bat viruses is performed with immortalized rodent, human or non-human primate cell lines. The difficulty in interpreting these data is that no comparisons have been made to the reservoir host cells. Nipah virus P, V and W proteins target the STAT1 pathways in human cells [43] , but these viral proteins have not been examined in cells from Pteropus giganteus, a natural reservoir of Nipah virus.

Situations such as these, which increase the probability of human exposure to animal parasites, have been prioritized for surveillance of novel zoonotic diseases. Contemporary surveillance approaches have proven successful in documenting novel simian immunodeficiency viruses [25] and have contributed to an increased understanding of transmission risk for early detection. Despite these advances, surveillance and monitoring of zoonoses remains largely reactive in that typically the emergence of a parasite in human populations must occur before research is conducted to determine its patterns of transmission, the health impacts on infected hosts, or the suite of hosts it is able to utilize.

Human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for infections to spill over in the future. Ecological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts, including humans, involve a complex mixture of processes, and understanding these complexities may aid in predicting spillover. In particular, only once the pathogen and host ecologies are known can the impacts of anthropogenic changes be fully appreciated. Cross-disciplinary approaches are required to understand how host and pathogen ecology interact. Bats differ from other sylvatic disease reservoirs because of their unique and diverse lifestyles, including their ability to fly, often highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and low fecundity rates. We highlight how these traits may affect infection dynamics and how both host and pathogen traits may interact to affect infection dynamics. We identify key questions relating to the ecology of infectious diseases in bats and propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data-driven mechanistic models to elucidate those aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses.

Taylor et al.

Therefore, the role wildlife plays in transmission or as a reservoir host of this pathogen is unknown. Antibodies to this pathogen were detected in five of 20 snow leopards including both males and females. This is the first time C. burnetii has been recorded in this species in the wild. Although very few species of wild felids have been tested for this pathogen, it has been detected in the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) [56, 57] . These studies provide an overview of the level of infection in free-roaming felines and highlight their potential zoonotic risk to humans. Fourteen wild caught Pallas' cats near the Russian-Mongolian border were reported to be negative for C. burnetii in 2010 [50] . However, C. burnetii has been detected in other felid species in captivity, such as in aclinical lions in a zoo [58] . Felids, including domestic cats (Felis catus), have been identified as potential reservoir hosts for the bacteria and a source of infection for humans and other animals [59] [60] [61] . The presence of C. burnetii antibodies in the snow leopards suggests they may function as a part of the epidemiological cycle of C. burnetii just as domestic cats have been reported to do in other regions [62] . Assessment of the role of wild and domestic hosts as potential reservoirs of misdiagnosed zoonoses, such as Q fever by C. burnetii, is an important public health issue today both for wildlife conservation and management of disease in the human-livestock-wildlife interface [56, 63] . Coxiella burnetii can cause abortions, mainly in ruminants, however, its pathogenicity in cats has not been established to date [64] . F8 who was positive for C. burnetii was the cub of F7 who was also positive for C. burnetii suggesting vertical transmission of the pathogen or common and continual exposure of this pathogen. Continued monitoring of this population is necessary to assess potential effects on reproduction. As DNA was collected from all animals, parentage of future captures can be determined which in turn can reveal possible effects of C. burnetii on subsequent reproduction. The snow leopards may have been exposed to C. burnetii when preying on domestic goats, ibex or rodents that also inhabit the area. These species also tested positive for exposure to this pathogen in concurrent studies (Esson unpublished). Coxiella burnetii is extremely resistant to environmental conditions being able to withstand cold temperatures and UV light so that it could remain viable in the Mongolian environment for extended time-periods [65] . Ruminants are the primary carriers of this pathogen and shed it in their milk, blood, placenta and faeces [58, 61] . However, ticks can act as vectors and other mammals such as rodents can also carry C. burnetii [57, 66, 67] . Vaccinating domestic stock would help control transmission among livestock and potential spill over to native ungulates such as ibex and Argali sheep by reducing the deposition of pathogens onto shared grazing regions. Vaccinating against C. burnetii would also potentially help mitigate the potential risk of spill-over to people, dogs and other wildlife, including snow leopards. Ticks from three of the snow leopards tested positive for unidentified species of Coxiella but were not from those snow leopards that were seropositive for C. burnetii. It is possible that the hosts did not have time to develop antibodies prior to sampling during the study. The role of ticks in the transmission of C. burnetii is unknown [67] and thus warrants further research.",55.00124682854706,20.38897501284761

Some of these newly emerged viruses such as corona-, henipa-and filoviruses are zoonotic and show high pathogenic potential in humans [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . As generally assumed for the reservoir hosts, bats do not develop severe clinical symptoms upon these viral infections. The reasons are still not fully understood and little is known about the immune system of bats and its interaction with pathogens. As the only flying mammals, bats have evolved special anatomical and physiological characteristics. Several of them appear to be relevant for their role as reservoir hosts of viral agents. As opposed to the reduced body temperature when resting, the body temperature of bats may increase during flight to above 40 • C, which is thought to mimic a fever [30] . On the other hand, the reduced body temperature and low metabolic rate during hibernation or torpor have been discussed to negatively affect the efficient immune response to infections. This may impair viral clearance, and therefore, by transmission to juvenile bats born after hibernation, may even cause virus persistence in the affected colony [31] [32] [33] . The roosting of certain bat species in gatherings of thousands if not millions of individuals is thought to facilitate high intra-and interspecies contact rates that might allow efficient virus transmission [31, 34] . Deforestation, growing urbanization and environmental changes have not only destroyed great parts of the bats' habitats, but have also increased their interactions with humans and livestock [35] [36] [37] .

This is termed propagule pressure in invasion science and is analogous to concepts of infection frequency (relevant for spillover and introduction to new areas) and infective dose that are important in infectious disease epidemiology [13, 17, 47] . If propagule pressure is low, introduced species are more likely to undergo stochastic fade-out for a range of reasons, including the probability that an infected individual meets enough naive individuals for at least one of them to acquire infection (for infectious diseases), or to mate successfully (for any species undergoing sexual reproduction). (ii) Compatibility: Both invasive species and EIDs must be capable of surviving in their new environment to the point of reproduction, and then of reproduction that supports stable or expanding populations. The capacity of an invading species to reproduce in the invaded environment is often measured as the intrinsic growth rate of the population (r, which is a timebased metric) in invasion science and the basic reproduction number (R 0 , which is a generationbased metric) in epidemiology. For persistence (i.e. naturalization) of invasive populations or EIDs, they must be compatible with 'environmental' conditions (including quantities such as host population size and density) to the extent that r is positive and R 0 is greater than unity [15] . Whether or not an introduced organism becomes naturalized or invasive depends, to a great extent, on the eco-evolutionary experience of the introduced species and the recipient community. Ecoevolutionary experience describes the historical exposure of an organism to biotic interactions over evolutionary timescales [48, 49] , and emphasizes the role of traits selected for in previous environments ( pre-adaptations), within both introduced and resident species, in driving the establishment success and adaptability of introduced species. In other words, eco-evolutionary experience determines the ease with which an invader can integrate into novel ecological contexts, and pre-adaptations are crucial determinants of a species' invasiveness and a community's invasibility [48] [49] [50] [51] . Continuing evolutionary change of invading species is commonplace [52] , and often involves admixture (intraspecific hybridization between previously allopatric populations) or hybridization between closely related species (e.g. [53] ). Such genetic recombination often leads to enhanced performance by invasive populations due to heterosis and hybrid vigour [54] . However, many invasive species adapt in the absence of admixture or hybridization [54, 55] , resulting in traits that increase their performance. For example, invasive species may undergo rapid evolution in traits related to dispersal (e.g. [56] ) and much insight has been gathered on such adaptations by identifying candidate genes underlying them. Adaptive emergence of EIDs for transmissibility of animal pathogens to or among humans explicitly requires genetic change, by mutations and recombination events [10, 11] . However, as for non-diseasecausing invasive species, pathogens and disease vectors continue to evolve and adapt to new environments into which they have been introduced, enhancing R 0 within the invaded environments [57, 58] . For pathogens of animals and humans, evolution towards increased R 0 typically involves trade-offs between traits of transmission (higher pathogen loads mean more efficient transmission when contact is made between infected and naive hosts) and virulence (higher pathogen loads mean greater morbidity/mortality and reduced contact rates between infected and naive hosts) [59] . Such evolutionary processes are, however, highly idiosyncratic among pathogens that are transmitted by different routes [60] and among different populations [61] . Genetic changes may also permit invasive species and EIDs to persist long-term and not undergo 'boom and bust' which may occur for a range of reasons, including depletion of resources [62, 63] . (iii) Environment: Environmental conditions determine whether a recipient location provides a suitable niche for species to establish and spread. Abiotic factors including climate (e.g. temperature, rainfall/humidity), and substrate qualities are key to whether introduced species can survive. Biotic factors, ranging from host population size, density and connectedness, and nutritional resources through 'enemies' ( predators, parasites, pathogens, competitors and, for microorganisms, immunity and cross-immunity) to more complex community interactions, will determine whether introduced species can survive and reproduce [32, 64] . When biogeographic barriers are breached by human action, species may be introduced to ecological niches that are suitable for their survival and reproduction and which also provide an 'enemy-free' space that further permits their establishment and spread. For this reason, the realized niche of species may be much larger in their introduced ranges than their native ranges [65] . The same is true of EIDs when they are introduced into an immunologically naive population [15] . While evolutionary change in invading species may alter the compatibility of the invading species with the invaded environment, environmental change may facilitate invasions by creating new suitable niches for invading species without the need for evolutionary change. Human disturbance of natural communities, ranging from replacement of natural vegetation with agricultural systems to more subtle changes, can make them more vulnerable to invasive species [66, 67] . Such changes have similar effects on the process of emergence of infectious diseases in both wildlife and livestock [68] . Current and future global change (climate, biodiversity, landscape/land-use change, including urbanization) are likely to facilitate both disease emergence and biological invasions, while some sudden and unpredictable environmental fluctuations may inhibit invasions [69, 70] .",43.18961682092763,17.353965701262812

Effective surveillance for pandemic threats would permit early identification of potentially pandemic strains, monitor the change in viral transmissibility between humans [8] and support early initiation of public health responses. Focusing surveillance on clusters of cases that are linked temporally and geographically and so are more likely to represent person-to-person transmission is potentially an efficient strategy for deploying limited surveillance resources to identify pandemic threats.

Their significance as reservoirs of emerging infectious diseases, predominantly of viral origin, has been increasinglyecognized during recent decades [1, 2] . In contrast, the study of bacterial infections in bats hasprogressed more slowly [3] . Bacteria of the genus Bartonella are small and slow-growing Gram-negative aerobic bacilli. These bacteria parasitize erythrocytes and endothelial cells of a wide range of mammals. During the last six years, diverse Bartonella strains were identified in bats from Europe [4] [5] [6] , Africa [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , Asia [13, 14] , and Latin America [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Recent studies have demonstrated significant patterns of evolutionary codivergence among bats and Bartonella, demonstrating that strains of Bartonella in bats tend to cluster according to bat families, superfamilies, and suborders [20, 21] . Host specificity and codivergence have also been documented in rodent-associated Bartonella strains [20, 22] and bat-associated Leptospira strains [23] . Despite their apparent host associations, Bartonella spp. can spillover into phylogenetically distant hosts, including humans [24, 25] . A recent human case of endocarditis in the US Midwest was associated with a novel Bartonella species (B. mayotimonensis; [26] ), which later was isolated in bats in Europe [5] . This human case has demonstrated the zoonotic potential of bat-borne Bartonella and underscores the need for extended surveillance and studies of these pathogens.",38.93774532212689,16.572836913931926

For example, isolates of Bartonella from genogroup Mini-1 were found in E. serotinus, My. blythii, and P. pygmaeus, and isolates of Bartonella from genogroups Rhin-1 and Rhin-3 were found in My. emarginatus and My. blythii, respectively (Table 3) . Though infrequent, these spillover events can be explained by the co-occurrence of these bat species in the same roosts Bartonella in Georgian bats (Table 1) , wherein transmission may be facilitated by shared vectors. Ectoparasites were collected from bats at the sampled sites in Georgia in 2012, but have not yet been identified and are thus not included in this study. However, there are numerous ectoparasite species reported on our seven focal bat species in the literature. While some ectoparasite species preferentially feed on specific bat hosts, they can also be found infrequently on other bat hosts, which may lead to transmission of bacteria. For example, bat flies (Diptera: Nycteribiidae) can be closely associated with one or a few bat hosts: Basilia nana with Myotis bechsteinii [57] , Basilia nattereri with Myotis nattereri [58] , Nycteribia schmidlii and Penicillidia conspicua with Miniopterus schreibersii [59] , and Phthiridium biarticulatum with Rhinolophus spp. [60] . Nevertheless, there are recorded incidents of these bat flies on other bat hosts, including the focal species in this study: Basilia nana recorded on My. blythii and My. emarginatus [61] , Basilia nattereri recorded on E. serotinus [62] , Nycteribia schmidlii recorded on My. blythii, My. emarginatus, R. euryale, and R. ferrumequinum [61, 63] , Penicillidia conspicua on My. blythii [61] , and Phthiridium biarticulatum on E. serotinus, Mn. schreibersii, and My. emarginatus [61, 64] . Other ectoparasites can have broader and more evenly distributed host ranges, and may be found infesting our focal bat species. Argas vespertilionis (Ixodida: Argasidae) has been collected from E. serotinus, My. blythii, P. pygmaeus, and R. ferrumequinum [61, 65, 66] . Cimex pipistrelli (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) has been reported parasitizing E. serotinus, My. blythii, My. emarginatus, P. pygmaeus, and R. ferrumequinum [67, 68] . Additionally, Spinturnix myoti (Mesostigmata: Spinturnicidae) has been recorded on E. serotinus, Mn. schreibersii, My. blythii, R. euryale, and R. ferrumequinum [69] [70] [71] . This short review of the literature is not exhaustive, but is meant to illustrate that nonspecific parasitism by Bartonella genogroups in some bat hosts can potentially be explained by sharing of ectoparasites. Future analyses exploring the influence of ectoparasite distributions on sharing of Bartonella genogroups among bats are in progress.",41.85041666682552,16.35903831054366

These data, together with a high exposure to potential sources of zoonotic disease, indicate a possible elevated risk of zoonotic infections in the cohort subjects. We also identified significant differences between exposures to potential zoonotic sources by location, sex, age group, education level, and profession; high frequency of contact with animals is associated with a likelihood of increased zoonotic transmission (Howard and Fletcher 2012; WHO 2017) . Therefore, it is important to elucidate the demographic/social factors that drive zoonotic infections to induce feasible interventions and to determine whether consistency or variation in exposure over time results elevated or reduced risk.

As a previous example, an HKU-2 bat origin, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome (SADS)coronavirus emerged in the swine population in 2017 in Guangdong, China [27] . Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman hosts including swine and wild animals and further genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, and other SARS-like CoVs may reveal the possible intermediate host of the recently emerged human SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the current outbreak and is a very important One Health measure. When the transmission chains and ecology of SARS-CoV-2 are clearer, the next step is to identify potential interventions to mitigate transmission. The unavailability of information on the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 and leaving the intermediate host undetermined are of high risk to humans and may well result in new outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 or similar viruses, and future epidemics. In addition, exploring the intermediate host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 will help conduct further investigations to evaluate the host-pathogen relationship, disease dynamics and the possibility of reverse zoonosis. These interventions will likely include measures of several different types including several different disciplines [42, 43, 48] . Hypothesizing that bats will be proven as SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs and that adaptation to humans took place in an intermediate host in a live animal market, the following measures would be important: i) Decreasing the risk of transmission from the natural host. This includes more knowledge of the natural ecology of the virus, so that high-risk transmission situations can be avoided. Also, it is important to consider transmission risks when new interfaces between bats and humans are created, e.g. when human habitations extend into bat habitats. Finally, there are important social science/behavioural measures conveying the message to the public which interactions with bats should be avoided (based on disease ecology knowledge).",42.76588924742416,15.708924522557222

Although the ecological reservoir for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV remain undefined, evidence of viral presence in a variety of animal species has been found. Serologic evidence and the isolation of viral genomic material for SARS-CoVrelated viruses have provided evidence for bats as the putative reservoir for SARS-CoV. While masked palm civets and raccoon dogs were involved in transmission to humans and initially considered potential reservoirs, they are now considered as incidental or spillover hosts [39] [40] [41] .

More than two thirds of emerging human pathogens are of zoonotic origin, and of these, more than 70% originate from wildlife [1, 2] . In novel environments, viruses, particularly RNA viruses, can easily cross the species barrier by mutations, recombinations or reassortments of their genetic material, resulting in the capacity to infect novel hosts. Because of their adaptive abilities, RNA viruses represent more than 70% of the viruses that infect humans [3] . When socio-economic and ecologic changes affect their environment, humans may encounter increased contact with emerging viruses that originate in wild or domestic animals. Wolfe et al. in 2007 [4] and Karesh et al. in 2012 [5] described different stages in the switch from an animal-specific infectious agent into a human-specific pathogen. The key stage is the transition of a strictly animal-specific infectious agent (originating from wildlife or domestic animals) to exposed human populations, resulting in sporadic human infections ( Figure 1 ). If the pathogen is able to adapt to its human host and acquire the means to accomplish an inter-human transmission, horizontal human-to-human transmission occurs and maintains the viral cycle. Sometimes, an intermediate host, such as a domestic animal, is the link between sylvatic viral circulation and human viral circulation. For example, some human infections originating from bats, such as Nipah, Hendra, SARS and Ebola viral infections, may involve intermediate amplification in hosts such as pigs, horses, civets and primates, respectively [6] (Figure 1 ). Genetic, biologic, social, political or economic factors may explain a switch in viral host targets. For example, climate changes may influence the geographical repartition of vector arthropods, leading to new areas of the distribution of infectious diseases, like Aedes albopictus and Chikungunya infections in the Mediterranean [7] . Morens et al. [8] listed different key factors that may contribute to the emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases, such as microbial adaptation to a new environment, biodiversity loss, ecosystem changes that lead to more frequent contact between wildlife and domestic animals or human populations, human demographics and behavior, economic development and land use, international travel and commerce, etc. [9, 10] . These patterns of transmission allow identifying different animals to follow in order to monitor the appearance of new or re-emerging infectious agents before its first detection in the human populations. Therefore, hematophagous arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals may serve as targets for zoonotic and arboviral disease surveillance, particularly because sampling procedures and long-term follow-up studies are more easily performed in these hosts than in humans.",49.40638968617847,18.862964084197042

Because humans and arthropods may share a common habitat, arthropods may feed on humans. When an arthropod feeds on a vertebrate host, it injects saliva into the host's blood and, if the micro-organism was previously able to replicate and to migrate into the salivary glands of the arthropod, the micro-organism is concomitantly injected to the vertebrate host's blood when the arthropod feeds. Such arthropods are called vectors. Medical entomology has therefore studied vector-host relationships for the last century. Several human pathogenic micro-organisms, including a large number of viral families, are transmitted via the bite of a bloodsucking arthropod. Reservoirs may be the hematophagous arthropod itself if viruses are maintained by trans-ovarial and trans-stadial transmission to the progeny, or in several cases, the reservoirs may be of wildlife or domestic animal origin, with arthropods providing the transmission of the virus between the two vertebrate hosts.

The presence of Bartonella in saliva samples contrasts with previous work showing an absence of Bartonella in vampire bat saliva [44, 81] , providing evidence for possible direct transmission. Bartonella in fecal samples could also suggest environmental transmission between bats [18] . Both saliva-borne and fecal-oral transmission of vampire bat Bartonella could further pose potential risks to humans or livestock, either through bites during feeding or by environmental exposure of humans that enter roosts or to domestic animals exposed to bat feces [18, 38, 48, 82] . For the former pathway, however, a recent survey of Bartonella in Mexican ruminants did not identify being bitten by vampire bats as a risk factor for infection [81] , and our phylogenetic results provide relatively more support for the possibility of vector-borne transmission. Vector-borne transmission of vampire bat Bartonella might reduce their potential to infect humans or livestock, given the high host specificity of most bat flies [31, 32] . However, ectoparasite transfer between individuals could still occur during pupal deposition and close contact [83] , facilitating Bartonella transmission within vampire bat colonies and to other bat species. While our analyses of ectoparasitism only considered bat flies, we have observed heavy tick burdens of vampire bats in other field sites (e.g., Belize). Bartonella has been detected in ticks infesting other bats [28] , and these ectoparasites could also be more likely to facilitate cross-species transmission [30] . Metagenomics also potentially identified Bartonella ancashensis and B. bacilliformis in vampire bat fecal samples, and these species cause notable infectious disease in humans likely through phlebotomine sand flies in Andean regions of Peru [84, 85] . Controlled infection trials and more extensive phylogenetic analyses of Bartonella in vampire bats, their various ectoparasites, and sympatric prey are therefore needed to examine the contributions of different transmission routes for bacterial spread within vampire bats and to recipient prey and to confirm whether saliva and feces represent viable transmission routes. Given the high rates of bat bites and proximity to wildlife, humans, and domestic animals that define vampire bat ecology, such efforts to verify the possibility and frequency of oral and environmental exposures would elucidate Bartonella transmission dynamics in this common host species and the risks of cross-species transmission.",42.29955763771526,17.667686648210257

Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly via contact with an animal or indirectly via exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host, human-to-human transmissions may occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic, such as the A/H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. Thus, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important challenge for public health officials in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e., the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, is promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods that are closely in contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals (in particular blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present its possible future application for the surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases.",43.83890446566487,17.473807012935783

Recent viral zoonoses have led to some of the most devastating and medically relevant outbreaks in modern history, including SARS coronavirus, pandemic influenza, and HIV/AIDS, highlighting the urgent need to understand how viruses adapt to infect new species. At a population level, factors influencing the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans include increasing population density, greater contact with wildlife, increased travel, and poor public health infrastructure [2, 3] . However, these factors only allow the microbe increased access to new hosts; they do not directly enable it to adapt to and replicate in the new species. Intermediate hosts, animals that are not the natural host of a virus but are still permissive or semi-permissive for viral replication, play a critical role in cross-species transmission. These hosts can facilitate increased contact between a virus and a new host, and drive adaptive changes that may improve virus replication (Reviewed in [4] ). For example, spill-over of Nipah virus from fruit bats into pigs, the intermediate host, increased human exposure to the virus and resulted in eventual human outbreaks in Malaysia [5, 6] . In another example, lentiviral adaptation through intermediate chimpanzee hosts led to both increased contact with humans, and adaptive genetic changes permitting the virus to inhibit the human versions of several host restriction factors (Reviewed in [7] ).",57.248875463283596,21.730616119004075

More specifically, in the last few decades, the emergences of several zoonoses such as avian influenza (AI) H5N1 or H7N9, the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Arabic peninsula, Q-fever in the Netherland or Ebola in Western Africa have each time been considered as unprecedented events. We understand some of the reasons for these emergence events retrospectively, but we fail to predict them adequately. These emergences of zoonoses are of particular human health concerns. They caused several hundred human infections with high fatality rates and AI and MERS, for example, could gain the capacity to transmit between humans, and to cause epidemics of unknown magnitude and impact. We argue that the failure to predict these emergences may be due to two main reasons. First, predictions are most often based on what is currently known of a disease and its risk factors where it circulates, but we fail to consider factors that could be important in different areas or under different conditions. Second, gradual changes in anthropogenic, environmental and wildlife factors are difficult to monitor, and the result of their potential interactions through different conditional feedback loops are inherently difficult to predict. Recognizing these challenges, the FAO publication ""World Livestock 2013: changing disease landscapes"" [2] proposed to structure the understanding and mitigation of emerging zoonoses by considering the pressure, state and response framework used in environmental sciences. The description and understanding of pressures is somewhat larger than the classical focus on risk factors, as it entails looking at broad-scale spatio-temporal pattern of changes in generic anthropogenic, environmental and wildlife drivers of change. For example, the description of changes in animal trade networks in response to new socioeconomic conditions may influence a broader set of diseases that can transmit through those trade networks. Similarly, political and socio-economic instability and migration crises have disruptive implications for many human and animal diseases alongside other environmental and wildlife factors. Studying the state strives to understand how changes in pressures have resulted in disease outcomes, or may influence disease outcome in the future. It is disease-specific and aims towards a fine understanding of the mechanisms by which changes in those anthropogenic, environmental and wildlife drivers may influence the emergence, spread or persistence of a particular disease. Finally, the response looks at the different options of intervention at the pressure or state level to prevent emerging zoonoses or to mitigate their impact [2] . In this paper, we discuss different sets of pressures that can be linked to emerging zoonoses, taking avian influenza as an example. Pressures typically include anthropogenic (trade of live animals and animal products, distribution of farms and livestock, farming practices, farmers' behavior, product price and farmer's income, hunting practices, game animal transport, short-term mobility and migration of populations, socio-economic instabilities, state of veterinary services, regulation), environmental (climatic variables, land-use, land-cover, habitat connectivity) and wild-host related drivers (wildlife or vector distribution and population dynamics, vector capacity, reservoir capacity).",36.560329621697946,15.376205949965039

The most notable viruses in which natural transmission from bats have been implicated include filoviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses, lyssaviruses and bunyaviruses. The implication of bats in transmission or maintenance of some of these viruses is very circumstantial and often based only on serological evidence. More convincing evidence for others is based on detection of viral nucleic acid and isolation of live virus, although this does not conclusively prove that a vertebrate host is a reservoir. Finding pathogens in bats leads to the questions of how they are transmitted between bats, and from bats to incidental hosts such as humans. One possible transmission mechanism could be bat-associated hematophagous arthropods, such as the bat flies, but migration of parasites between bats is not well understood and would require further entomological investigation to better understand [13] .",36.2759928334165,14.067126484706295

Today it describes its core vision as 'a world where wildlife thrives in healthy lands and seas, valued by societies that embrace and benefit from the diversity and integrity of life on earth'. 47 It can be regarded as a US equivalent to the Zoological Society of London, and it runs several zoos and wildlife parks in the USA, including the Bronx Zoo. In addition the WCS runs an international programme of field research and conservation projects; fundraising, policy-making and campaigning; and it has pioneered veterinary wildlife research and practice in its zoos and in the field. From the late 1990s, a small group of veterinarians working at the WCS (including William Karesh and Steven Osofsky) started building collaborative links between themselves, scientists studying emerging infectious diseases, and veterinary scientists and clinicians involved with global livestock health. 48 In 2003 they co-organized a workshop in Durban, South Africa, with the Veterinary Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The purpose of the meeting was to further this collaborative agenda, bringing in practitioners working in government, international health and conservation non-governmental organizations to launch a new international network for health, environment and development, entitled AHEAD. In the workshop briefing, the organizers laid out an agenda for developing better collaborative relationships across these fields, which they described as ""One Health"". 49 The following year the WCS group organized an international conference on the theme of One World, One Health (OWOH), which was sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation and held at the foundation's university campus in New york. Over the next few years it built links with the international Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), contributed to international responses to HPAI, and continued to publish its ideas about OH in academic and policy journals. 50 The proceedings of the AHEAD workshop outlined the WCS group's ideas about OH in more detail. Starting with the WHO's widely accepted definition of 'health' as a state of positive wellbeing (rather than the absence of disease), advocates of 'ecosystem health' argue by analogy that ecosystems can also be regarded as patients and evaluated as healthy or otherwise. The WCS veterinarians built on this idea, bringing it together with Schwabe's 'visionary attempts … to construct a bridge between medicine and agriculture' to argue for a broader collaborative approach to improving the health of humans, animals and environments, which they described as OH. 51 These wildlife veterinarians developed the idea of OH primarily to advance their conservation agenda, but it was particularly grounded in thinking about problems of infectious disease, especially zoonoses. Their thinking around zoonotic diseases was, and is, unusually broad. While the WHO defines 'zoonosis' as disease transmission between animals and humans, most actors in global public health today use the term to denote the transmission of infections from animals to humans. By contrast the WCS group and their collaborators discuss the movement of infectious diseases between multiple species, back and forth across wildlife and livestock, humans and animals, much as Schwabe did when challenging the human-animal distinction at the core of 'zoonosis'. 52 If anything, the WCS group took this even further, highlighting the particular risks of transmitting common human infectious diseases to endangered species of wildlife.

Further research is warranted to better understand and tease apart these contributing factors, and we recognize some of the limitations of this preliminary study. First, our analysis was limited by the availability of comparable data sets for a given gene and host taxonomic group. This precluded us from examining Leptospira in rodents; and resulted in low support values from some nodes in our phylogenies. Table 1 . Results from event-based cophylogeny, using default cost settings of 0, 1, 2, 1, 1 in Jane. In the future, using multiple genes or full genome data, for a greater number of bat and rodent taxonomic groups and bacterial microbes once they are available, will allow for more robust taxonomic analyses. Also, in addition to host phylogeny that we examine here, future data collection and analyses should focus on arthropod vector host specificity and phylogenetic relationships to better predict specificity within Bartonella. Future investigations should also consider the role of host geographic range and niche overlap to explain pathogen sharing between hosts. The application of spatial analyses of wildlife hosts for both Bartonella and Leptospira will provide valuable information on transmission potential based on the role of contact vs. cophylogeny. We predict that species with overlapping ranges will share more similar communities of Leptospira than non-overlapping bat species, regardless of their phylogenetic relatedness. For Bartonella there is also likely to be a geographic effect, as interaction among bats of different species within multi-species roosts, or shared habitats, could be an important factor for bacterial pathogen sharing. Lastly, this work is particularly important because it involves two emerging, neglected tropical diseases with known, sylvatic wildlife reservoirs. Bartonella has been of concern as an emerging zoonoses due to its ability to induce life-threatening illnesses such as endocarditis, myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, and contributing to chronic debilitating disease, all while being difficult to diagnose in humans as well as animals [86] . Leptospirosis is a constant concern to public health authorities, and annual global incidence of severe leptospirosis has been estimated as 500,000 [87] . Elucidating the diversity and coevolutionary patterns of these bacteria in their natural hosts and understanding the frequency and causes of host-switching events, will help us better predict spillover from the mammal reservoirs into humans. Disruption of strict coevolutionary patterns, as we observed for both bacterial genera, to varying degrees, provides a framework to forecast pathogen spillover potential to any mammalian host, including humans [88] . The methods that we employed here to study bacterial disease in bats and rodent hosts are broadly applicable to a wide range of other disease types, including viruses in their mammalian hosts. By expanding these tools to better understand the evolutionary past of pathogens within and among wildlife hosts, we gain information to better predict the outbreaks of the future.

These interventions will likely include measures of several different types including several different disciplines [42, 43, 48] . Hypothesizing that bats will be proven as SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs and that adaptation to humans took place in an intermediate host in a live animal market, the following measures would be important: i) Decreasing the risk of transmission from the natural host. This includes more knowledge of the natural ecology of the virus, so that high-risk transmission situations can be avoided. Also, it is important to consider transmission risks when new interfaces between bats and humans are created, e.g. when human habitations extend into bat habitats.

Because of contact between bats and other animals, including humans, the possibility exists for additional interspecies transmissions and resulting disease outbreaks. The purpose of this article is to supply an overview on the main pathogens isolated from bats that have the potential to cause disease in humans. Bats, mammals of the Chiroptera order, are present all over the world with the exception of the Arctic, the Antarctic and a few oceanic islands. Bats are the only mammals with the ability to fly and are present in 41100 different species. 1 Bats are essential members of the global ecosystem and humans benefit from their presence in many ways. They are involved in seed dispersal and pollination activity: tropical bats are vitalas an examplein rebuilding cut down forests and in the pollination of wild plants as bananas, avocados and dates. Furthermore, the flying mammals are the major predators of night insects, including crop and human pests. 1 Finally, their guano, which is rich in nitrogen, is used as biological fertilizer. Despite the multiple benefits attributed to these animals, since the ancient timesthrough myths and misapprehensionsbats have gained a bad reputation in the general public. The classical literature is full of examples in which bats are associated with evil and darkness. The roman poet Ovid narrates in the Metamorphoses that the god Bacchus transforms the daughters of Mineus, king of Boeotia, into bats as a punishment for profanating his celebration (Figure 1 and Box A). In the Divine Comedy (Inferno -Canto XXXIV), Dante Alighieri, the father of the italian language, describes the devil Lucifer as bearing large bat wings ( Figure 2 and Box B). In the eighteenth century, scientists called 'vampire' a bat that fed on blood, giving rise to the myth of human vampires that sucked blood from other men and could transform into bats. The Irish novelist Bram Stoker with his novel, Dracula (1897) did nothing but make this belief famous worldwide. More recently, Bob Kane, an American comic book artist, ideated a character called Batman a positive character that, however, disguises in a bat costume to scare his enemies: 'Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot. So my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible..... 'Just then a huge bat flies in the open window'. A bat! That's it! It's an omen. I shall become a bat! In: Detective Comics no 33, 1939. Bats, however, can be involuntarily dangerous to humans. Indeed, they are natural reservoir hosts and sources of infection for several microorganisms, including pathogens that can cause severe human diseases, and are more frequently implicated in zoonotic virus emergencies. 1, 2 Bats are widespread in urban areas and come in close contact with both domestic animals and humans, contaminating houses with guano and urine, additionally, humans occasionally encroach into bat habitats. 3 Their characteristic ecology undoubtedly influences the maintenance and transmission of microorganisms within the colony and directly or indirectly to humans. 1, 3 Microbial transmission within bat colonies is promoted by the behavior of several species of these mammals aggregating in crowded roosts. Bats can transmit infectious agents to humans through intermediate hosts, which are in close contact with humans. 4 These intermediate hosts can be infected in many ways, including ingestion of food partially digested by bats. Frugivorous bats, in fact, cannot ingest wide amounts of food because of the aerodynamics of flight, 5 therefore, they extract nutrients by chewing fruits and spitting the residues. This partially digested food dropped on the ground can then be ingested by other animals and is a potential infectious source. A similar modality of viral transmission has also been described for insectivorous bats. 5 Bats can also directly infect humans. 4 This can occur through ingestion of infected bat meat, as in some areas bats are a food source, or through bat's bite as in the case of rabies virus.",54.40443540546223,22.37324855651978

If the biting invertebrate has previously bitten the alternative maintenance host, it could, in principle, infect bats. Hematophagous insects have been screened for EBOV during or after outbreaks with no conclusive results [26, 75] . However, absence of exposure during an outbreak does not mean that the host is not involved in the maintenance of the virus in-between outbreaks. For example, the process of amplification in disease ecology can involve different hosts than maintenance hosts. Little information is available on ticks in bats. Ticks have been suggested to be involved in the transmission of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever-like viruses to bats [76] , and are seriously considered as potential hosts for the transmission of other pathogens from non-bat hosts to bats. Mosquitos could also be a vessel for a vector-borne transmission of EBOV. Studies on mosquito blood meals have revealed that mosquito could feed on bats and other mammals [62, 63] . Bat flies appear to be highly bat-specific, adapted to their lifestyle [77] [78] [79] [80] and are involved in the transmission of pathogens [64] . However, this specificity would preclude interspecies pathogen transmission. Ectoparasitism provides a potential solid source of indirect contacts between the alternative maintenance host and bats. This transmission pathway should be explored much further, and ecological insights, including insect and bat behavioural ecology, will be necessary to target the right insect species within the diversity of available biting species, in the right habitat (e.g., tree canopy level, caves' roofs, when bats are immobile) at a proper time (e.g., nocturnal behaviour of bats) and season, when both hosts (i.e., the maintenance host and bats) can be fed upon by the vector.

Currently, hundreds of confirmed rabid bats are reported annually in North America [17] and the persistence of RV in a broad range of native bat species continues to be a public health hazard due to the high fatality rate of this disease and frequent failure of the public to associate bat contact and even superficial bites with potential rabies exposure [21, 22] . While timely post-exposure or pre-exposure vaccination can prevent rabies in humans and other mammals, after onset of clinical disease the prognosis is extremely poor with almost 100% mortality [23] . Additionally, the persistence of RV in chiropteran hosts provides a source of potential cross-species infection for domestic animals and can, on rare occasions, result in the establishment of bat RV variants in terrestrial wildlife [24] , events which have the potential to undermine rabies control activities in non-flying RV reservoir species.

It can still be summarised as follows: roosting in trees (hanging or in holes) or caves, flying, eating insects while flying (insectivorous bats)/eating fruits in trees (fruit bat), flying back and roosting in trees or caves; with biannual long-range migration or nomadic movements for some species [50] . A single bat can cover a large variety of habitats and even regions for those migrating. Therefore, the transmission pathways from bats to other animals through urine, saliva, birthing fluids, and placental material and/or guano could be important (see review on Ebola isolated from body tissues and fluids [51] ). Predation is also a less known but potential transmission pathway from bats to predators [48, 52] . The range of potential species at risk of infection from bats is thus large [53] . However, the range of potential transmission pathways available for the maintenance or bridge host (under scenario B and C in Figure 1 ) to infect bats seems to be much more limited. For example, bats seldom use the ground floor: transmission routes requiring direct contact or environmental transmission on the ground do not expose bats. In other terms, direct contacts with strictly ground-dwelling animals would be very unlikely. Four habitat types structure the various transmission pathways from the alternative host to bats (and each bat species will frequent only a fraction of these habitats: (i) open air while flying, for insectivorous bats also while feeding; (ii) surface water when drinking; (iii) cave roofs and walls as roost habitat; (iv) tree canopy for roosting or feeding. From these four habitats, potential transmission routes to infect bats from other hosts can be inferred (Table 1 ). In the following sections, the different transmission pathways that can link potential alternative hosts to bats are listed and discussed, along with examples of these alternative hosts.

In bats, various Pasteurella speciesmainly P. multocidahave been identified as the main pathogens of several localized and systemic infections. 51, 58 The predominant source of infections appears to be wounds caused by the bite of domestic predators. However, a recent study from Wisconsin in USA reported for the first time an outbreak of acute pasteurellosis from P. multocida in wild bats without associated traumatic injures. 59 Leptospira sp. Leptospira has worldwide distribution and its transmission to humans is primarily through exposure to water contaminated with the urine of infected animals. 60 Bacterium harbors in several wild and domestic hosts, colonizes their kidneys and it is eliminated in their urine. The presence of Leptospira in bats has been demonstrated in several studies. 51, 61, 62 However, the potential role of bats in human leptospirosis is questionable. 63, 64 In a case report, the patient's history of bat exposure supports the idea that bats are a reservoir of the bacterium and can serve as a vector in disease transmission to humans. 64 Enterobacteriaceae Several members of the Enterobacteriaceae familyresponsible for a variety of human illnesseswere isolated from bats. 51, [65] [66] [67] A number of studies reported that Salmonella serotypes isolated from bats have similar characteristics to those found from livestock and humans, indicating that bats can be locally important in the epidemiology of salmonellosis in human and domestic livestock. 51, 66 Two of these serotypes, S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, are a frequent cause of human and animal diseases.",47.42335280360043,18.53779151443085

Specific mechanisms are required for the emergence and transmission process and these mainly include a certain level of host behaviour, pathogen changes, and environmental factors as well as contact and/or spillover between reservoir specimens and the native host [2, 17] . While reservoir and secondary hosts favour transmission to other species including wild animals, domestic animals, and humans, changes in susceptible host behaviour due to population density and biodiversity favour sustained pathogen spread. Epidemics in pandemic proportions emerge due to sustained intersusceptible host or secondary host transmission of pathogens; thus failure to initiate cross-species infection or generate secondary infections interrupts the emergence process [4] . Some infectious agents that have adapted to nonhuman hosts can be transmitted to humans but not from human to human, resulting in what is termed a ""dead end"" transmission. Thus, most of the important EIs, unlike HIV, are mainly zoonoses, in that they are infections in animals that are transmitted to humans. Others are vector-borne diseases and so require arthropod vector for their transmission from one vertebrate to another.

However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses.

Bats are an important reservoir of several pathogenic agents, mainly viruses, and many of them have already caused disease outbreaks worldwide. The increasing rate of bat-associated infections is also supported by an expanding overlap between bat and human habitats. Recently, to increase the knowledge of bat-associated viruses, a database has been constructed (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir). 76 DbatVir analyzes the virome diversity of bats as well as the ecological and epidemiological data to examine and track current and future bat-related transmissible diseases. To date, DbatVir has collected information on 5717 bat-associated animal viruses detected from 207 bat species in 77 different countries (update on 2 march 2016). Strategies on surveillance and monitoring of disease outbreaks in bat populations need to be further developed, in particular where bats and humans are in close contact. Extensive studies are also needed to improve our understanding of bat-human interactions to design new control measures in future.

We found discordance between the available surveillance studies and the pathogens that can be shared across species. More than 50% of pathogens that cause clinical disease in other species did not have any North American studies of prevalence in wild pigs. This contrasts with the potential exposure of livestock to wild pigs; domestic animals such as cattle and sheep, that are largely pasture raised in North America, have a potential for coming into contact (directly or indirectly) with wild pigs 74, 75 and share nearly 90% (see Table 4 ) of swine pathogens causing clinical infection. Those studies that do report prevalence are generally limited to local or regional investigations 76, 77 . While providing important data, local studies may not represent regional or national prevalence. We found only a few studies 20, 78 that report prevalence and epidemiological patterns of infection at national or near national scales. Pathogens that did have multiple studies in different regions (e.g. leptospirosis, pseudorabies virus, swine brucellosis, and bovine tuberculosis) had prevalence estimates that ranged from 0-87% indicating spatial heterogeneity in prevalence and transmission risks likely occur. This result may be complicated by true and false detection errors that few studies addressed when reporting findings 79 and can have large effects on estimated disease prevalence in wildlife 80 . Comprehensive surveillance systems that integrate livestock, wildlife, and human components have been previously identified as a need 81 . Explicitly accounting for the transmission potential and historic geospatial distribution of pathogens to prioritize surveillance (both livestock and wildlife) may offer benefits and reduce knowledge gaps for pathogens of concern for human, wildlife, and livestock health 82 . Developing a comprehensive national monitoring system that integrates domestic and wild animal surveillance, prioritizes pathogens based on transmission risk, potential consequences, and knowledge of occurrence could yield economic benefits for livestock health by reducing spillover events through early detection and risk mitigation 83, 84 . Incomplete knowledge of the presence of pathogens in wild pig populations and the transmission potential we found may pose risks for foreign animal diseases in North America where wild pigs are potential hosts.

Taxonomic and life history characteristics,"Pathogen spillover is a common phenomenon driving infectious disease in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Intuitively, one might expect that there are some features shared among reservoirs that not only enhance their ability to serve as hosts but also their tendency to be involved in pathogen spillover. While anecdotes and simple summaries indicate that rodents, bats, ungulates, and domestic animals are common sources of human disease, our analysis sought to include spillover pathogens affecting other animals as well. In addition, we aimed to account for publication biases and other attributes of the data that could skew inferences. Further, we investigated whether exceptional life history traits may underlie a mechanism by which reservoirs are associated with spillover. We find that most reservoirs of spillover pathogens include wild animals, include mammals, and are made up of a community. We found more artiodactyl and carnivore and fewer bat and primate species to be reservoir hosts than expected by chance. These findings may signify characteristics of these orders that predispose or prevent them from serving as reservoirs. High priority zoonotic pathogens are more likely to have avian reservoirs, while among pathogens with epidemic potential in the target population, primates are overrepresented despite being relatively uncommon reservoir hosts in general. Finally, compared to mammals overall, mammalian reservoir hosts tend to have faster mass-corrected life history characteristics, specifically those associated with high reproductive output rather than long-term survival. There is widespread debate in the scientific literature surrounding the definition of a reservoir, with the term ""reservoir"" often being used loosely. Our study relied on a clearlydefined reservoir concept [6] to aid in interpretation of the scientific evidence for reservoir identity. For example, rather than simply equating natural infection with reservoir status, we sought evidence that would satisfy both parts of the Haydon et al. [6] definition. We made every effort to seek all available evidence for inconclusive cases but made some partially subjective decisions to exclude disease systems on the basis of insufficient data. We felt justified in these decisions since inclusion of disease systems based on weak or even incorrect data could bias our interpretations more than using a sparser (although possibly non-representative) dataset that included disease systems and host species that have received more extensive research attention.",49.35786368809892,18.063577692975237

This empirical evidence then needs to be allied with robust theoretical and computational methods to understand the drivers of transmission, and explore alternative disease management scenarios. We make the following specific recommendations on what is needed to successfully tackle both ancient and emerging NZDs in the future: 1 We need a detailed empirical understanding of the biology and relative importance of each key host species. This involves not only understanding how to reliably identify key host species within multihost parasite systems, but also the magnitude and precise nature of their contribution to transmission, which may involve a variety of processes (Fenton and Pedersen 2005) . 2 We need improved cutting-edge genetic and genomic tools to differentiate infectious agents, across both species and strain level. Such tools will enable researchers to track the gene flow of key infectious agents, for instance between wildlife, domestic animals and humans, as well as reveal, for instance, novel host switching and introgression events that are currently missed with existing tools unless they involve recombination between very different genetic backgrounds. 3 We need the development of methods for high quality behavioural tracking of hosts that can characterize in unprecedented detail their social networks and the barriers and conduits for spread within and between species. 4 The application of novel mathematical and statistical approaches from the fields of statistical, computer science and network analysis will be important in order to model gene flow across such multihost parasite trans-mission networks and to provide a quantitative understanding of transmission ecology for multihost parasites. Furthermore, molecular studies combined with mathematical modelling using an R 0 framework will be critical to identify key hosts and hence identify targets for control. Such modelling will require empirical evidence on factors such as differential pathogen susceptibility to control measures (e.g. drug susceptibility), patterns of interaction between humans, livestock and wildlife, and integration with data collected from other sources such as livestock numbers. Ideally we should also look to extend these frameworks to explore potential evolutionary responses of the parasites to imposed control measures, for example to understand the likely impacts of different control measures on patterns of parasite evolution including drug resistance and hybridization. 5 Finally, if we are to fully understand the impact of NZDs on human disease as well as how relationships between the causative parasites and their hosts may be changing, we need to stress the importance to policy makers of incorporating each of the above into expanded monitoring and evaluation components inherent in all human and animal disease control efforts.",49.271993708591765,17.875270393931256

Animal reservoirs can maintain transmission with zoonotic parasites, even while the disease they cause in humans is effectively controlled (Box 1; Table 1 ). This is common and not restricted to tropical diseases, with examples such as the maintenance of bovine TB by reservoir hosts including, but not necessarily exclusive to, badgers in the UK (Mathews et al. 2006) . The epidemiology of multihost parasites can involve a complex community of reservoir and vector species, and where infected hosts may range from spill-over to maintenance hosts and from relative specialist parasites to true multihost generalists (Box 1). Within this context, the importance of differing hosts may vary and it is imperative, if often difficult, to identify which is which. Each host species is unlikely to contribute equally to parasite transmission, as they differ in abundance, exposure and susceptibility, and the transmission pathways among them (Haydon et al. 2002; Fenton et al. 2015) . Even parasites with a very broad host range often occur or are transmitted predominantly by just a subset of potential hosts, or 'key host' species (Box 1). Moreover, for a given zoonotic parasite, the relative importance of different host species, that is the key hosts, can vary across ecological settings. These host species (which can also refer to intermediate host and vector species (Molyneux 2003)) not only act as a source of parasitic infections but also play a fundamental role in driving parasite gene flow through the community. Therefore, they can act as a driver of evolutionary change, but also potentially be a source of genetic bottlenecking within the parasite population. Due to both the clear importance of understanding such heterogeneities in disease transmission across host communities (for instance, for effective control, we would need to identify which species are important for amplifying transmission and transmitting to target host populations), and the likelihood that evolutionary selective forces may differ between such hosts and environments, it is thereby imperative to first identify key host species acting as reservoirs of infection (Haydon et al. 2002) . However, to fully understand and predict the transmission dynamics of any infection, it is also essential to know the relative contribution of any particular host species to the transmission dynamics of the parasite (Rudge et al. 2013; Fenton et al. 2015) and the importance of the host species to the evolutionary pressures acting on the parasite. At the extreme, multihost parasites may depend on a single species for long-term persistence, a 'maintenance' key host (Box 1). Being able to identify these key hosts is essential in determining which host species to target for disease control (Haydon et al. 2002; Fenton and Pedersen 2005) . For example, rabies virus infections in wild carnivores in the Serengeti depends on viral maintenance by domestic dogs, so vaccinating dogs is expected to alleviate epizootics in wildlife (Lembo et al. 2008) . Consequently, interventions such as vaccination, culling or sterilization commonly target single species rather than all infected hosts.

Parasitic vector-borne diseases are classical emerging infectious diseases in human populations such as leishmaniosis, Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis among others. Eukaryotic parasites are among the most significant agents of emerging diseases of wildlife and domestic animals [20] . Parasites are part of biological diversity; however, pathogenic species may pose a threat to conservation of their natural hosts or of new species of hosts. A striking example cited is translocation of animals from their natural habitat to another habitat or to a different region of the world when their parasite fauna are also exposed to new species of hosts. In fact, when the new hosts become infected with these novel parasites, the pathogenicity and epidemiology of the infection become unpredictable. The introduction of a parasite to a new environment may or may not affect population density of the host, but runs the risk of introducing non-indigenous parasitic infections [18] .",46.24551648196454,18.397601042229994

Infection dynamics are shaped by (and can, in turn, feed back to shape) bat ecology and related ecosystem processes; in turn, infection dynamics influence spillover dynamics. Human -bat interactions, including livelihood and ritual practices, bring different people into contact with bats and potentially expose them to disease. The public perception of bats and bat diseases can trigger eradication efforts that may then increase spillover risks. Public health impacts and detection, including disease surveillance and diagnostics for known pathogens (and capacity to detect previously unrecognized pathogens through newly evolving 'pathogen discovery' techniques [21, 22] ) and healthseeking practices, shape whether human infections with bat-derived pathogens are recognized. Such local system dynamics are shaped by wider drivers of change (environmental, social, political and economic), operating across different geographical scales. Importantly, our framework integrates a focus on political, cultural and policy framings, examining how different people in communities and in national and international agencies understand and represent spillover dynamics, public health threats and influences, and how these framings shape policy responses.

In West Africa, E. helvum bats probably birth and mate during migration [65 -67] , which might be linked to, or even driven by, the nutritional needs of the females and their offspring, but the timing and place of these remain largely unknown [65, 68] . It is possible, therefore, that spillover events occur on the migratory route of this species. Knowledge about migration, time and place of the reproductive cycle in conjunction with the number of animals at any given time and place, and resource availability will provide crucial information about these ecological keystone species, and point to where and when potential spillover to humans should be researched. Alternatively, bats may use migration to escape from areas with high disease load, or lower pathogen prevalence during migration [69] . The ecology and distributions of fruit bats in many countries in which spillover may occur are not very well characterized, particularly quantitatively. This is the case even in Australia, although huge advances have been made there in recent years [47] .

In Australia, however, where Hendra virus spillover could come from any of four fruit bat species, the role of sympatry and cross-species virus transmission in driving spillover has not been elucidated at all [46] . A first necessary focus in many regions is the development of national schemes to locate, count and monitor bat colonies of focal bat species, to determine migratory patterns and to assess the reproductive cycle and efficiency. Quantification of social interactions between bats (e.g. mother-offspring, mating, fighting, allogrooming, etc.) would provide information on possible virus transmission routes. A second essential focus should be to understand feeding behaviour and ecology, as undertaken already in Bangladesh [74] . The use of novel high-resolution GPS data loggers allows detailed and quantitative studies of ranging behaviours of bats and their environmental determinants. Such methods would also underpin the identification of food plants and allow resource use to be quantified through faecal analyses [75] .

Diverse species of wild animals that are confined in zoos, sanctuaries, kept as pets, and sold at markets are also subject to circumstances that facilitate cross-species virus transmission via intimate contact, particularly for zoonotic viruses already adapted to transmission among domesticated animals. Vectorborne transmission similarly enables opportunities for effective contact across diverse animal hosts, which is consistent with our finding of higher host plasticity among vectorborne viruses. Through this mechanism, vector-borne transmission has facilitated emergence of animal diseases in humans, particularly those from wildlife, and, for viruses with generalist vectors, this transmission route is an effective method for interspecific dispersal 6 .",42.13033407450571,16.67872372997104

In addition to an emphasis on vector control, the myriad of other high-risk interfaces with human activities that have facilitated animal-to-human viral spillover should be a focus for education and interventions directed at disease prevention. More in depth investigation of the epidemiology of zoonoses at high risk human-animal interfaces is needed to assess risk of viral disease emergence and direct global, as well as local, disease prevention and control. Risk for a new human pandemic is likely highest at the high-risk interfaces facilitating disease threats in the past. Unfortunately, wild animal hosts and high-risk interfaces facilitating spillover of zoonotic viruses, particularly beyond their first emergence, remains vastly under-reported. Adequate data on circumstances at the point of disease spillover are lacking for many viruses because animal involvement in zoonotic disease exposure is very difficult to ascertain and this information is often not linked to diagnoses in published reports. Global animal disease data are largely incomplete due to inadequate livestock and wildlife health surveillance worldwide. Resulting ascertainment biases are especially problematic for spillover events that do not involve professions likely to self-report, as is likely the case for veterinarians, researchers, and scientists working at laboratory facilities. Detailed patient histories that elucidate activities precipitating animal exposure will greatly assist in completing the epidemiologic picture underlying the emergence of many zoonotic viruses. This, together with heightened surveillance to gather data on human practices enabling contact with animals in settings with diverse host assemblages, particularly at high-risk interfaces under-reported to date, will direct us towards critical control points for disease control and behavior change interventions aimed at prevention.",44.50922998496078,16.668452872811397

In a number of locations in Ghana where bats occur, they are under some form of protection for various reasons such as traditional taboos, military presence, or deliberate protection [42] . Human-bat interaction occurs for a number of reasons. Hayman et al.

The interactions may be indirect, in the form of odour from faecal droppings, urine, aerosolization of saliva, and glandular body secretions [43] . It may also be direct through hunting and processing of bat bushmeat for consumption [2, 10] . In Ve Golokuati, the findings showed that human interaction with bats is both direct and indirect, which suggests that the residents may be at risk to disease spillover.

This measure provided key insight into the probability of mammalian hosts sharing pathogens with humans (question 2). It suggested that, regardless of pathogen type, mammal species that can spread more of their pathogens indirectly through their neighbours are more likely to harbour zoonoses than other species. (ii) Our ensembles provided a flexible, robust, unbiased mechanism to address our questions. (iii) By investigating sharing of pathogens across multiple taxa and sub-taxa (e.g. DNA/RNA viruses, Gram+/Gram− bacteria), we were able to ascertain important differences in the mechanisms of sharing of different types of pathogens, and the effect this has on zoonoses. (iv) In addition, by integrating three measures of centrality, rather than focusing on a royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspb Proc. R. Soc. B 287: 20192882 single measure, we were able to differentiate key species in networks based on the unique characteristics of each network. This was highlighted where host species with higher betweenness carried more zoonotic viruses and bacteria, whereas hosts with higher Opsahl degree carried more zoonotic helminths and protozoa. (v) Finally, we were also able to differentiate the roles that host order and their domestication status play in different networks. We recognize several areas for future improvements of our models. First, our data were mined mainly from published research and deposited genetic sequences. While we made best effort to capture all interactions available within our resources [19] and to control for research effort as per previous studies [9, 12, 16] , we realize there are inherent biases in our data sources. Recent research has revealed that between 20 and 40% of pathogen host ranges are currently unknown [47] . An area of future improvement will therefore focus on closing this particular knowledge gap, furthering recent attempts to predict missing interactions in networks such as ours. Second, edges in our networks, which represent sharing of pathogens, may be interpreted in a variety of ways including: spillover; direct contact; indirect sharing through vectors, intermediate hosts or environment; and coevolution of specific host-pathogen lineages. To further improve our models, we will aim to distinguish between these various events, focusing in particular on the role of transmission routes as means to include direction of pathogen sharing into our undirected networks. Third, we have focused our analyses on host and pathogen species interactions with minimal geographical layering. Geography plays a key role in facilitating host interactions and affects the probability of contact between humans and wildlife, which in turn increases chances of zoonotic transmission [5, 48] .

In the current study, we identified seven bats [including three insectivorous bats (Hipposideros cineraceus, H. armiger and Taphozous melanopogon) and two frugivorous bats (Eonycteris spelaea and Rousettus leschenaultii)] positive for paramyxovirus by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that paramyxoviruses carried by insectivorous bats were distinct from those found in frugivorous bats (Figure 1 ). Virus sequences from insectivorous bats could not be definitely assigned to any existing paramyxovirus genus, however, they appeared to cluster within the relatively new genus of the Jeilongvirus [37] . Moreover, we found that KC599257 (E. spelaea) and KC599259 (R. leschenaulti) from fruit bats belonged to henipavirus-related paramyxovirus and Rubulavirus genus, respectively. The finding of a henipavirus-related agent in E. spelaea provides further evidence that there is a large spectrum of henipa-like viruses among bats, including insectivorous species. Li et al. [42] previously found serological evidence of henipa-like viruses in bats, including Rousettus spp., Myotis spp., Hipposideros spp., and Miniopterus spp. in China. Henipaviruses have thus far overwhelmingly been identified in Pteropus and Eidolon species, though this may, in part, be due to a lack of surveillance in non-pteropodid bats [2, 17, 43] . The phylogenetic distance of species may constrain both cross-species transmission and host shifts and thus result in the separation of viruses [44] . Previous studies demonstrate that humans can be infected by paramyxoviruses through a secondary host species, such as horses and pigs, or directly from bats [9, [45] [46] [47] . Although it is currently unknown whether paramyxoviruses, such as Jeilongvirus, are capable of infecting people, the potential risks of bat borne paramyxoviruses to human health should be considered and surveys of human populations highly exposed to bats for evidence of spillover of bat paramyxoviruses would help establish the public health risk.",41.34018571692162,15.644671355993633

The recently increased distribution of the arthropod (mosquito) vector Aedes aegypti, for example, has led to massive outbreaks of dengue fever in South America and Southeast Asia.

Nipah, Hendra, and perhaps SARS-CoV and Ebola viruses, are on the list of emerging viruses that involve amplification in bat hosts [52] . Although TCRV was isolated from bats [19] , the suggestion that Artibeus species bats serve as the natural hosts for TCRV has been questioned [53] . Our observation that AjTfR1 is an efficient receptor for TCRV, and also for JUNV and MACV, supports a role for bats in sustaining the replication of arenaviruses. Ecological surveys of bats for novel arenaviruses are thus warranted, and may afford further insight into the diversity of arenaviruses. In addition, although cats experimentally infected with MACV do not become ill [54] , viral titers in these animals were not determined. The finding that feline TfR1 supports the entry of AMAV and the pathogenic clade B arenaviruses thus highlights a possible role for cats in serving as intermediate hosts in the transmission of NW arenaviruses to humans [39, 40] .",37.87464356468001,13.863234497766271

We estimated, in quantitative and qualitative terms, the evolutionary history and extent of the association between environmental and demographic factors and geographical distribution of the PRRSv in endemic settings. We demonstrated that pig density and climate seasonality were not only important factors for maintaining endemic PRRSv strains, but also, they likely shaped genetic diversity over time as well as spatiotemporal diffusion patterns. Simultaneously, we revealed the wide and rapid spatiotemporal diffusion characteristics in the evolution of emerging strains. We demonstrated how the combined use of the analytical tools here was not only able to identify the geographical risk of PRRSv outbreaks but also were able to distinguish between endemic and emerging strains.",35.087933484609835,13.820135663314232

Bats formed significant reservoirs of RNA viruses. Taking the total number of known extant species of species-rich orders into account [46] , we found that 52.46% of carnivores shared pathogens with humans, followed by 35.50% of known primates and 26.32% of known Artiodactyla.

For example, although Eidolon helvum poxvirus 1 is closely related to MOCV, a human-only contagion, poxvirus-associated lesions mirroring MOCV-disease have also been found in horses, donkeys and a red kangaroo [41] [42] [43] . Similarly, the discovery of Eptesipox virus in North American brown bats is analogous to the discovery of the other North American poxviruses found in voles, skunks, raccoons and squirrels, which are also detected at high prevalence in their reservoir hosts [44, 45] . Notably however, in the initial Eptesipox virus report, the authors comment that poxvirus infection manifesting as musculoskeletal disease (osteomyelitis) has also been reported in human VARV and Vaccinia virus (VACV) infections [35] . However, given that no bat poxviruses identified to date are orthopoxviruses, and the little information available, it is clear that much more detail is needed before the potential threat of bat poxviruses to man can be commented on.

In addition, related hosts may sometimes inhabit the same geographic region, increasing the probability of cross-species transmission through more frequent exposure [13] . Indeed, a useful generality in studies of disease emergence is that the closer the phylogenetic relationship between hosts, then, given appropriate exposure, the more likely that a pathogen will be able to jump between them, in turn leading to preferential host switching [27] . If true, so that cross-species transmission results in a viral phylogeny that mirrors that of their hosts, then any phylogeny-based approach such as that utilized here will underestimate the true frequency of host jumping. As a case in point, although there is a general concordance between the phylogenies of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and their primate hosts, in which four species of African green monkey harbor distinct forms of SIV that is clearly suggestive of co-divergence [19] , it has been argued that the evolutionary history of SIV may also have been shaped by preferential host switching [28] , although these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. In contrast, incomplete lineage sorting among closely related viruses may produce a false signal for cross-species transmission when co-divergence has in fact occurred [19] . In addition, because there is growing evidence that viruses can have complex evolutionary histories with genes derived from multiple sources [29] , it is important to note that our virus phylogenies are necessarily gene trees rather than species trees. It is therefore possible that other virus gene trees will exhibit a stronger topological match with host phylogenies than those presented here, and hence provide more evidence for co-divergence. Finally, while our analysis was only based on robust phylogenetic patterns, because nodes that were topologically uncertain were excluded from the analysis, it is possible that our virus trees contain topological errors reflecting the use of sometimes small numbers of highly divergent sequences.",38.2934153386545,15.33161033272814

Nevertheless, components of Darwinian fitness correlated with intestinal biome features can provide insight into the function of associated organisms for their host. At a more basic level, research on a broad range of wild mammals is required to permit the correct functional role (parasite, commensal or mutualist) to be assigned to individual taxa present in intestinal biomes, and in the case of predatory species to correctly differentiate passaging material such as parasites of prey from true host gastrointestinal biome constituents. For the latter, high resolution amplicon markers (e.g., COI; Hebert et al., 2003) and analysis of correlations of the composition of the apparent intestinal biome and ingested food items might offer solutions. Annotation of taxa with functional roles additionally requires databases collating such information (Poelen et al., 2014) . Whereas studies on humans and laboratory animals have revealed the importance of the bacterial microbiome in host nutrition, physiology and immune processes, little is known about the impact of intestinal eukaryote diversity and composition on any host. We propose that the assessment of intestinal biomes in freeranging wildlife in the context of host fitness in terms of survival or reproductive success can help to identify beneficial and adverse community compositions for different demographic or social categories of host populations and distinguish those from dysbiosis. The hologenome concept of evolution proposes that evolution in complex organisms should, in addition to considering interactions between an individual's genome and its environment, also consider its interactions with the products and physiological processes arising from the combined genomes of the microorganisms it hosts (Zilber-Rosenberg and Rosenberg, 2008; but see Douglas and Werren, 2016) . This has led some to suggest that, during the current period of rapid environmental change, the plasticity of the gastrointestinal microbiome may help some vertebrate populations adjust in an appropriate manner (Alberdi et al., 2016) . We suggest that research on the roles of intestinal biomes for humans and wildlife should in addition encompass both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, including those traditionally thought of as parasites and the vast majority of organism so far unknown for their impact on hosts, before we can arrive at a balanced view of the benefits and costs of different community compositions of intestinal biomes.",38.00070373460452,15.002258711911043

Additionally, other unexpected pathogens such as Anaplasma spp. and B. quintana (an agent causing Trench fever) were detected among UFI patients as well as Bor. miyamotoi in rodent populations. However, to date in-depth analyses as to how, when and where transmission occurs are lacking. Human, animal, and vector interactions play a major role in disease transmission and form a dynamic transmission cycle. Pathogens can spread from animal-toanimal or animal-to-human by several modes of transmission. Probably the most important method of transmission occurs during feeding by parasitic arthropods. This study employed NGS and metagenomics to characterize bacterial pathogens and understand their transmission in animal, human, and vector populations. Several pathogens were detected in rodent and vector populations indicating the complex ecology of bacterial pathogens and their reservoir hosts and vectors in the area close to where human activities occur which increase the risk of human-animal interface. The most apparent example is scrub typhus where O. tsutsugamushi was found in UFI patients, chiggers, and rodent populations. These data clearly illustrate the complex picture of pathogen transmission from animal reservoir hosts to humans via arthropod vectors. Local public health officials can effectively use the data to assist in understanding the seasonality of diseases such as scrub typhus and the populations most at risk. Information can be shared locally and preventive measures, such as repellents, can be used when appropriate.

For example, long-term virus-host codivergence has been suggested to play a key role in the evolution of vertebrate herpesviruses over periods of~400 million years [1] and insect baculoviruses over a time-scale of~310 million years [2] . Indeed, it has been proposed that a number of families of DNA viruses have codiverged with their hosts over long evolutionary time-scales [3] [4] [5] , and do so more frequently than RNA viruses, which in contrast display a combination of co-divergence and host switching [6] . In particular, while phylogenetic trees for some RNA viruses, such as particular retroviruses, are generally congruent with those from their hosts suggesting long-term codivergence [7] , for others, such as flaviviruses, host jumping appears to be relatively frequent [8] . In the case of flaviviruses this likely in part reflects the fact that many are transmitted by arthropod vectors and characterized by short durations of infection.

Metagenomic approaches combined with NGS can be powerful tools to disentangle complex patterns of pathogen transmission among ectoparasites, animal reservoirs, and humans. For example, NGS has been used to perform blood meal analysis to determine the wide-range of animals that vectors feed on and possible reservoirs (Alcaide et al., 2009) . NGS has also been useful in finding unexpected pathogens not normally associated with particular vectors (Vayssier-Taussat et al., 2013) and has been used to show the genetic diversity of bacteria that are specific to certain animal hosts and vectors (Pierlé et al., 2014; Swei et al., 2015) . Such information can be used to correlate infections in people with important vectors and reservoir hosts.",35.60587783550362,13.327638171496977

Viral shell proteins constitute the protective proteinaceous layer which is needed for virus to survive during its transmission between the hosts. Figure 1 shows that the mean PID levels of M-proteins in coronaviruses are strikingly lower than those of influenza A. On the other hand, coronaviruses are often transmitted via the oral-fecal and fecal-contact modes [10, 13, 15, 18] , whereas the major transmission mechanism of the influenza viruses is the respiratory mode. Based on these and similar observations we hypothesize that there is a correlation Journal of Pathogens 7 between the PID levels in the viral shell proteins and the virus transmission modes. While higher levels of disorder in shell proteins are likely to be associated with greater probability of respiratory transmission, lower PID levels in the nucleocapsid and matrix proteins are conversely often associated with increased levels of fecal-oral transmission mode. These correlations can be due to the need of a given virus to adjust to the changes in the environmental conditions associated with the process of transmission between the hosts.",37.50612655213385,13.127144293246847

In some instances, there is direct evidence that viruses have spilled over from bats to other vertebrates. For example, Nipah virus spilled over from bats to humans and pigs leading to outbreaks in Southeast Asia and Hendra virus continues to spillover into horses and humans in Australia [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In other instances, the evidence of virus spillover from bats is circumstantial. For example, in case of ebolaviruses, serological evidence and the detection of viruses related to the ebolaviruses in bats [7, 8] suggests that they are reservoirs of the virus. Recent discoveries of filoviruses in bats of China and Sierra Leone have further bolstered this claim [9, 10] . However, viruses linked to specific Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemics have not yet been detected in bats. Although bats harbor many diverse viruses, their spillover to other animals is extremely rare [11] . One of the reasons is that for a spillover event to take place several factors such as pathogen shedding, environmental conditions, pathogen persistence in environment, and recipient host susceptibility, should all be conducive to transmission. This would result in the ""perfect storm"" required for spillover. A review by Plowright et al. [12] describes the factors that could lead to such a perfect storm. Here, we focus on one of the initial events affecting this spillover, i.e., an increase in pathogen shedding.",40.6949177207878,16.45343256869075

Occasionally epizootic rabies occurs in interior regions of Alaska [10] . Although the exact extent of enzootic regions is unknown. Large urban settlements such as the cities of Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau, are not directly affected by enzootic rabies apart from occasional importation of the disease through translocation of infected dogs from enzootic rural areas (for an example see [11] ). The regions of Alaska with the highest burden of rabies cases in both wildlife and domestic dogs, like many other remote arctic communities, generally lack adequate veterinary care and dog vaccination. In addition, the true burden of rabies, especially in foxes is not known, because diagnostic testing is generally limited to incidents of possible human exposure and animals suspected of having rabies in regions considered non-enzootic. There is little active surveillance of rabies among wildlife in enzootic regions of Alaska. The majority of rabies testing occurs only in close proximity to human infrastructure.

However, exposure to these pathogens -and by extension contact with domestic dogs -is not necessarily harmful in all cases. Indeed, the fact that we detected evidence of exposure to these pathogens in apparently healthy wild dogs, in a growing population, shows that exposure is not invariably fatal, and did not cause population decline at the level of domestic dog contact observed here. Exposure to these pathogens may maintain some level of immunity in the population, helping to prevent large outbreaks from occurring or mitigating their lethality, and may also help to maintain selection pressure for disease resistance. The balance between these positive and negative effects is likely to vary between pathogens, suggesting that a single management strategy (e.g., domestic dog removal) might not be appropriate for all pathogens. However, substantial increases in contact between wild dogs and domestic dogs -as might occur through land use change [25] would be expected to increase pathogen exposure for wild dogs and could undermine population viability. Our findings help to identify the most appropriate pathogenspecific control measures. Among the pathogens we studied, rabies virus has the clearest record of causing mortality in wild dogs [9, 10, 54, 55, 56] and is thus the most likely to require management intervention. The findings presented here, combined with those from other studies [25, 36, 57] suggest that, in principal, wild dogs might (where necessary) be protected from rabies by vaccinating either domestic dogs or wild dogs themselves. Both of these approaches have strengths and weaknesses: domestic dog vaccination can fail to protect wildlife if conducted over too small an area [2] , but has the added advantage of protecting human health [58] , whereas wild dog vaccination directly targets the host of conservation concern but has proven controversial in the past [59] . Deciding which form of management is most appropriate therefore requires a careful analysis of costs and benefits. Canine distemper virus is less likely than rabies virus to require management, since it has less of a history of causing wild dog mortality (but see [11, 12] ). However, should this virus seriously threaten a wild dog population, vaccination of domestic dogs might have no conservation benefit since there is growing evidence to suggest that this pathogen is not always maintained in domestic dog populations [36, 49, 50] . Protecting wild dogs from canine distemper would therefore need to target wild dogs themselves. For the other pathogens studied here, both disease dynamics and impacts on wild dog populations and are less certain; hence, deciding on the most appropriate form of management (if any) remains problematic. This study is one of a very small number of empirical attempts to quantify rates of contact between wild and domestic mammals [60, 61, 62] . To our knowledge, this is the first such study to successfully link individual variation in hosts' opportunities for interspecific contact to variation in pathogen exposure. Identifying such links required detailed data on the behaviour of both host species, highlighting one practical challenge of recognising reservoirs of pathogens affecting wildlife [5] , even when one of the hosts is a domestic species. Still greater challenges would be involved when both hosts are wildlife (but see [63] ). Nevertheless, further studies of this kind are needed to address the growing number of wild species threatened by infectious disease [64] .",38.71957572206368,14.681642997926259

All three disease agents can be traced back to bats, animals known to harbor other deadly viruses, including Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus (12) . Bat CoVs are highly prevalent around the world and also show great genetic diversity, making up almost 60% of all known Alpha-and Betacoronavirus species. It is generally believed that some of these bat CoVs have the potential to spill over into humans and other mammalian species, causing another SARS-like pandemic (13) . While predicting the potential spillover and emergence of a novel bat coronavirus is difficult, active surveillance is a valuable monitoring mechanism. Surveillance programs have been designed to aid viral discovery in wildlife reservoir hosts to mitigate infection and emergence in the human population. These programs propose to use next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other approaches to ensure unbiased evolutionary analysis of bat CoVs that takes into consideration their high genetic diversity (14) . In order to be effective, these types of surveillance programs rely upon processing of samples in a high-throughput manner and require the compilation of whole-genome sequences. Although NGS enables unbiased pathogen discovery, implementation of this methodology for virus surveillance is costly.

Empirical data on both contact rates [25] and pathogen exposure [36] suggest that, in this study area, domestic dogs do act as a reservoir for rabies virus: infection appears to persist in the domestic dog population, but not in the wild dog population [36] , probably because domestic dogs occur at high densities with high intraspecific contact rates, whereas wild dogs live at low population densities with few opportunities for transmission between packs [25] . In contrast, the other pathogens found to be associated with domestic dog contact -parvovirus, Ehrlichia and Neospora -might in principle be maintained in low-density host populations, like those of wild dogs, without the involvement of another primary host species [52] . This is partly because their transmission does not require direct contact between hosts, being able to survive in, respectively, the environment, a tick vector, and ungulate prey [52] and, in the case of Neospora, also being vertically transmitted [32] . It is possible that domestic dog populations function as reservoirs for these pathogens but, alternatively, domestic dog contact may simply elevate the prevalence of these infections among wild dogs, without being necessary for infection to persist. The latter appears especially likely for Neospora, which occurs at higher prevalence in wild dogs than in domestic dogs (Table 1) , with high prevalence perhaps being maintained by vertical transmission. We note that exposure to all of the pathogens considered here has been recorded among wild dogs inhabiting large protected areas remote from domestic dogs [9, 14, 17, 49, 53] ; hence the absence of domestic dogs does not guarantee total protection from any of these pathogens.",36.6710210335452,14.27795067352747

First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche. Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined. Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified. Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted. Should it be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future. Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.

Some of these zoonotic diseases originate in wildlife and others in domestic livestock species; many have the potential to affect humans through a livestock-human interface (Cleaveland et al. 2001) in which domestic livestock can act as ""amplifier hosts"" (Keesing et al. 2010) for diseases that they contract from wildlife and then pass to humans through frequent and close contact. In light of this, there is growing interest in promoting cooperation between medical and veterinary sectors, as captured in the concept of ""one health"" (Zinsstag et al. 2011 ).

Yet our understanding of these diseases has largely been shaped by evolutionary ecologists such as May and Anderson (1983) . This distinction reinforces separations outlined in Tinbergen's Four Questions (Tinbergen 1963; Nesse and Stearns 2008) . The former group of professionals focuses on proximate mechanisms of disease (i.e. 'causation' and 'ontogeny'); for example, aetiology or pathogenesis. The latter concentrate instead on the ultimate or evolutionary causes of disease (i.e. 'survival value' and 'evolution' or phylogeny). To understand the ultimate causes of disease spread, we must answer such questions as how pathogens can increase R 0 or how hosts adapt to emergent diseases. Where proximal methods are important for diagnosing and treating individuals, the primary focus of wildlife managers is population level indices of 'health', such as population growth, which can be affected by disease. The need remains for a more comprehensive synthesis of our understanding of wildlife disease from individual hosts to ecosystems (Tompkins et al. 2011) . For instance, aspects of disease linking different parts of an ecosystem include pathogen transmission that can vary within individual hosts due to heterogeneity in contact rates or immunity; transmission among multiple hosts and involves multiple pathogens; and occurs in environments with successional trajectories that affect which hosts reside within them (Fig. 2) . Ultimately, evolutionary principles can inform management strategies (Ashley et al. 2003; Hendry et al. 2011) and should help predict how species may or may not adapt when facing the selective pressures imposed by novel infectious pathogens, changing environments or management interventions.",43.8696552143226,17.582768063645112

Transmission between domesticated species and sympatric wildlife underpins the emergence of a range of wildlife diseases. Examples where the main reservoir is a domestic species are numerous, ranging from pneumonia transmitted from domestic to bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) (Cassirer et al. 2013) , cheratoconjunctivitis and brucellosis transmitted from domestic sheep to wild ungulates in Europe (Giacometti et al. 1998) , and salmon lice transmitted from farmed to wild salmon (Krko sek et al. 2006; Miller et al. 2014 ). These diseases can be controlled in domestic stock through vaccines or antibiotics but are nearly impossible to control in wild animals where they can cause devastating mortality. The reverse situation, where disease is transmitted from wild reservoirs to domestic animals, can also occur, although it is in many cases controversial as politicians and other vested interests find it simpler to blame wildlife species rather than addressing more complex causes of epizootics that require changes in farming practices. Examples include brucellosis and tuberculosis in wild bison (Bison bison), elk (Cervus canadensis) and domestic cattle in North America (Wobeser 2009) and tuberculosis in badgers (Meles meles) and livestock in Britain (Donnelly et al. 2006) .

In the specific case of raccoons in North America, rabies provides a very rare example of a wildlife disease that can be effectively controlled with a massive vaccination programme (Rees et al. 2011) , because of the availability of both an effective vaccine and an effective bait to deliver it (Boyer et al. 2011) .

It is believed that most CoVs, if not all, are also circulating in different mammal species originating from ancestral bat CoVs. Notably, only a small minority of the estimated 1,240 bat species has been tested for CoVs. It is likely that many more CoVs could be discovered in bats. Although 31% of bat-borne viruses are CoVs (Calisher et al., 2006) , only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bat CoVs. Even though the direct transmission of bat CoVs to humans has not been evidenced yet, the creation of conditions for more frequent encounters between bat CoVs, domestic animals and humans poses a significant threat for the future (Chan et al., 2013) . Considering that the increasing impact of human activities on the ecosystems is unlikely to abate in SEA, it is necessary to increase CoV surveillance in wildlife, cattle, pets and humans to better understand the dynamics of interspecies transmission and improve risk assessment, early warning and intervention (Devaux, 2012) . It will certainly be crucial to pay special attention to ""superspreaders"" who are very efficient at transmitting CoVs through exposure to respiratory droplets. The emergence of a disease is an accidental process and it is therefore impossible to predict the scenarios and dynamics of emerging infectious disease events. The attractive effect on bats of anthropized environments is a major risk factor in the emergence of novel bat-borne diseases in both humans and animals. Also, given the share of CoVs described in bats, i.e., 31%, the risk of newly emerging CoVs-associated diseases in the future should be considered seriously.

Although the transmission of lyssaviruses from bat species to humans or terrestrial species appears rare, interest in these viruses remains, through their ability to cause the invariably fatal encephalitis-rabies. The association of bats with other viral zoonoses is also of great interest. Much of the EU is free of terrestrial rabies, but several bat species harbor lyssaviruses that remain a risk to human and animal health. Whilst the rabies virus is the main cause of rabies globally, novel related viruses continue to be discovered, predominantly in bat populations, that are of interest purely through their classification within the lyssavirus genus alongside the rabies virus.

Seminal work conducted during this period began to shed light on the myriad linkages between human, wildlife and livestock hosts that result in pathogen spillover (successful transmission from one host species to another) and subsequent emergence events [17] . Taylor et al. [18] produced the first list and quantitative study of emerging pathogens (not diseases) which they defined as, ""… those that have appeared in a human population for the first time, or have occurred previously but are increasing in incidence or expanding into areas where they had not previously been reported, usually over the last 20 years."" They noted, ""Some definitions of emerging also include recently discovered aetiological agents of already-described diseases. However, if there was no evidence that such a pathogen was increasing in incidence, it was not regarded in this database as emerging."" Their tally identified 175 pathogenic species associated with emerging diseases, 75% of which were zoonotic (transmitted to humans from non-human vertebrates). Viruses and protozoa were deemed especially likely to emerge while helminthes were not, and no effect of transmission type (i.e., vector-borne vs. direct transmission) was detected. This [18] research paved the way for additional studies on the risk factors for human disease emergence. One of these studies updated the list assembled by Taylor et al., examined the relationship between host range and pathogen emergence, and identified social and environmental causal factors, i.e., ""drivers"" [19] . This study also revealed that emerging zoonotic pathogens can be maintained in a wide variety of non-human hosts, tend to have broad host ranges, and are largely the result of human impacts on the landscape (e.g., deforestation to support agriculture and livestock) and changing human demographics (e.g., population density in particular) [19] .",44.46897431746294,17.28046415733605

Also, viral hemorrhagic fevers, because of their high infectiousity and the dramatic outcome, have attracted the attention of the medical world and the public in Africa and around the world to this particular category of EID. 68 However, global effort in EID surveillance and investigation is inadequately allocated. Indeed, the majority of scientific resources focus on places from where the next important emerging pathogen is least likely to originate. 3 Jones et al. advocated for the re-allocation of resources to EID hotspots in lower latitudes, such as tropical Africa because of the critical need for health monitoring and identification of new potentially zoonotic pathogens in African wildlife populations, and this to be used as a forecast measure for EIDs. 3, 48, 67 Like other African countries, Gabonese resources for public health and health monitoring are unequally allocated; 60 % are spent at a central level. Public health services and clinical practitioners need more resources to be able to actively educate the public about the risks of repeated contacts with wildlife or other sources potentially harmful for health. 48 However, Gabon could be considered as a good model to investigate the emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic EID. On one hand, Gabonese forests are a hot spot for biodiversity (wild animals and unknown pathogens) and on the other hand there is a relatively small population (1.5 million of habitants), which is often in contact with surrounding wildlife. Also, the CIRMF, a research center advantageously located, offers high quality researchers and facilities that study pathogens and wildlife ecology. Altogether the combination of these factors should help to better understand the mechanisms of contact and transmission of new pathogens from wildlife to human, the emergence of zoonotic EID and the breaking of species barriers by the pathogens. Indeed the emergence of infectious diseases in wildlife is a continuous and ongoing process. The factors that give rise to zoonotic EID, such as ecosystem perturbations and modifications, climate changes, migrations of reservoirs species, pathogens or vectors, and intrinsic changes of pathogens may be of natural origin or due to human influences. 17 To understand the underlying mechanisms that govern relationships between reservoir species, ecological factors and environmental perturbations with the emergence, transmission and dissemination of viral diseases in tropical forests, the CIRMF wishes to set up permanent surveillance of the health of the population by the establishment of (1) a network reference laboratories (WHO based reference laboratories including CIRMF, Pasteur Institute Network and other National laboratories or universities based) and (2) a Health Ecology Observatory (that is,. The CIRMF's Scientific Station in la Lopé National Park). Such measures will compile data from the public health system with the monitoring of the emergence of new pathogens.

Their locations as well as their contacts with other individuals can be measured. As such, wild populations of rodents can be valuable as model disease systems to address relevant questions like: Are there key hosts for transmission? How does prevalence vary seasonally or over time? What is the contact rate between the reservoir and humans? How do these pathogens flow through populations? The answers are of critical importance because they provide an indication of when and where there is increased risk of a zoonotic event whereby a human becomes infected, or when a species becomes at genuine risk of extinction. By monitoring and manipulating wild populations, one might also be able to identify factors that may increase a pathogens chance of emerging. For instance, what characteristics of hosts and viruses make them more or less likely to be involved in cross-species transmission?

For example, hunting of bats for bushmeat, a major threat to Old World fruit bats [56, 64] , is a high risk activity that puts hunters and butchers in direct contact with blood and excreta and increases the risk of viral spillover from bats [65, 66] . Direct persecution of bats and attempts at population eradication (e.g., the recent culling of bats in Mauritius [67, 68] ) may have countereffects by actually increasing viral prevalence in the bat population [69] , and also increasing the opportunities for viral spillover through direct contact with bats during culling [12, 69, 70] . Similarly, the loss of bat habitat through land conversion for agricultural and livestock production and development, the primary threat to bats globally [3, 71] , is a major risk factor for zoonotic disease emergence [22] . Clearing of forested habitats, specifically for agricultural crops (e.g., fruit orchards), leads to the direct destruction of roosting and foraging sites, and therefore displaces bat populations. It also creates a direct interface between frugivorous bats and humans or livestock that can mediate viral species jumps (e.g., Old World fruit bats and Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh) [72] [73] [74] . Cave disturbance, such as resource extraction (guano or mineral mining), hunting, and ecotourism, is a major threat to bat populations [75] , especially for species less tolerant to human disturbance [76] , but can also lead to increased contact between bats and humans that may facilitate viral spillover.

A target for One Health programmes should be further exploration of the significance of these pathogens in animal and human medicine. A number of ehrlichial and rickettsial infections are shared by man and companion animals [26] . The cause of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia canis transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus) is not considered an organism with significant zoonotic potential (although human cases of infection are reported); however, human and canine infections with E. chaffeensis and E. ewingii (transmitted by Amblyoma americanum) are well-documented although it is not clear whether the dog acts as a reservoir for human infection. Of increasing significance in human, canine and feline populations is the Ixodestransmitted cause of granulocytic 'ehrlichiosis' (Anaplasma phagocytophilum). The reservoir species for this infection are wild rodents and wild and domestic ruminants, but human and companion animal infections are emerging as a significant problem in Europe and North America. The spotted fever group of rickettsiosis are also significant problems for man and dogs. In the Americas, Rocky Mountain spotted fever caused by Rickettsia rickettsii (transmitted by Dermacentor andersoni, D. variablis, R. sanguineus and Amblyomma cajennese) is the most important of this group, while in Europe, Asia and Africa, Mediterranean spotted fever caused by R. conorii (transmitted by R. sanguineus) is of greatest concern. The role of the dog in these human infections is again in transporting infected ticks into the domestic environment and the risk to owners of removing infected ticks from their pets. The early diagnosis of canine rickettsiosis by the veterinarian is of importance as this may precede the recognition of the pathogen in in-contact people. The flea-transmitted rickettsioses (R. typhi and R. felis) also fall into this group [23] . The reservoir potential for domestic pets for R. typhi is not proven, but there is much recent interest in the emergence of R. felis which is found in dogs, cats and cat fleas (Ct. felis) [23, 27] . As R. felis may be transmitted transovarially and trans-stadially, the domestic pet may introduce infected fleas into the home environment, which then become the means for human infection. Table 1 also lists a range of other vector-transmitted diseases shared by man and companion animals, a number of which are relatively uncommon causes of human infection, but are important in animal species (e.g. dirofilarasis, West Nile fever).",35.99185850907016,14.274541306903233

While most studies on infectious disease ecology focus on the dynamics of a single host species and single pathogen, we acknowledge that more research is needed to address the complexities of multi host-pathogen dynamics [148] . Community ecology, with its emphasis on the composition of and interconnections between ecological communities, allows one to understand infectious disease dynamics in multi-pathogen, multi-host disease systems that occur across diverse scales (e.g., from within a single host, to between species, to between regions) [148] . Other topics of importance deserving further study in bat species of Western Asia include: effects of extreme weather (e.g., heat waves) on bat survival, including changes in the distribution of bat species (and associated pathogens) and changes in prey abundance or food resources that could alter reproductive patterns and disease transmission [149, 150] . For example, increased prevalence of Marburg virus (MARV) in Rousettus aegyptiacus colonies corresponded with defined periods of synchronized parturition (which resulted in an influx of immunologically-naive, juvenile bats), as well as an increased incidence of spillover into human populations [77] . If such virus-host associations exist in regional bat species, climatic changes may affect reproductive phenology in bats, and therefore the timing of peak viral spillover into human populations. A systems-wide, hypothesis-driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors, and more effective policy recommendations for reducing the disease transmission and spread [146, 148] .",37.68153796292512,14.145656001011618

NGS has already been used successfully as both a diagnostic tool and a means to discover novel viruses associated with human diseases (2, 8, 15, 23, 44) . Applying NGS as a diagnostic tool holds the promise for a relatively unbiased view of the microbes infecting humans, as it does not require a priori knowledge of the pathogens present. It also has the potential to elucidate the spectrum of disease-causing viruses in patients with undiagnosed febrile illness, which is a common occurrence in health clinics around the world. NGS can also serve to increase the power of surveillance systems to detect infrequent zoonotic transmissions that have the potential to become pandemics. Epidemiological studies are ongoing with the aim of identifying factors that converged and potentiated the transmission and rapid dissemination of EVD throughout the Western African subregion in 2014. A potential index case for the current EVD outbreak may have been identified in Guinea (1). A recent report suggested that ecological factors may have contributed to the convergence of factors that culminated in the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Manu River region (3) . Anecdotal reports of an exceptionally dry and prolonged dry season, starting with sharply drier than normal conditions at the end of the rainy season, may have had an impact in triggering the transmission of EBOV from its natural host to humans. At least one conclusion may be derived from the current situation: it is clear that geographic expansion and increased human-to-human transmission of one of the most feared infectious agents known to science is underway.",33.09482384256921,12.67237669116597

Such infectious exposures could pose a risk to family members and other close contacts of the worker, and potentially even the global community. Almost a third of wildlife workers in this survey reported working and having occupational contact with wildlife in multiple countries, which may increase the risk of spreading infections to human or wildlife populations either through the worker themselves or through fomites. Extra precaution should be taken by those working in multiple countries to disinfect possible fomites, such as work boots or other reusable PPE. Such travel and exposure history emphasizes the importance of early recognition of an occupational infection in such persons. Enhanced occupational health programs with procedures for appropriate surveillance, diagnosis, and management of high-risk exposures and suspected workrelated illness across geographical regions, including the consideration of a wide range of both recognized and newly emerging potential animal pathogens could potentially help detect and prevent the sequelae of zoonotic infection.

Wildlife workers engaged in surveillance for infectious pathogens in wildlife face unique occupational risks due to their animal contact. In addition, due to the geographical dispersion of such surveillance activities, consistent occupational health preventive services for such workers may be lacking because of the variability in both access to and quality of local health services, differing cultural norms, and other local and regional factors.

Similarly, the ancestor of bird-CoV was transmitted to another species of birds and generated gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.

Based on the evolutionary relationship and molecular features of PEAV and bat-HKU2-CoV, as well as the important role of bat in the ecology of coronaviruses, we conjecture that the origin of PEAV is the result of the interspecies transmission of bat-HKU2-CoV from bat to swine approximately 90 years ago.",43.628311329084475,15.695565333763007

Whenever possible, educational efforts should be done in an informative, non-lurid way, presenting the facts rather than provoking additional fears to the already bad reputation of bats. Wherever possible, solutions should be found to enable the existence of bats in anthropogenic landscape, including the development of more affordable and readily available vaccinations (e.g. against rabies), and the reduction of potential contact between bats and humans and livestock. This however also includes that the natural habitats of bats need to be better protected to provide bat populations with sufficient space and to prevent range expansion into urban and suburban areas, where contact with humans and livestock may increase the risk of spillover events.

Vital to reducing the spread and impact of zoonotic pathogens to humans and among animal populations is early detection and isolation, which first requires observations of the affected animal hosts either when they are sick or dead. Because the transmission route for zoonotic pathogens from animal host to humans is inherently complex, evidence can be presented to advocate for both active and passive animal surveillance (Olson et al. 2012) . We suggest that, in part because of this complexity, both should co-occur in comprehensive surveillance programs for disease prevention in humans and wildlife. We have shown that 75 zoonotic pathogens are known to cause extended morbidity or mortality in their animal hosts, and we argue that the quick reporting of these sick or dead animals could have prevented the subsequent or concurrent emergence in humans. Active animal surveillance programs, although essential, are often costly and must be operated by extensively trained personnel thus limiting the scope of surveillance efforts. Passive animal reporting monitoring, on the other hand is a monitoring system that can employ low-cost technology available to civil servants (e.g., park rangers) and the public (e.g., hunters, farmers, citizens) of all income levels, greatly expanding the geographic range of surveillance efforts. If zoonotic disease surveillance and monitoring were limited to the sampling of live animals, it would greatly limit the scope of the search to a small proportion of the public trained for such sampling. We therefore propose that integrating an animal morbidity and mortality surveillance program is fundamental for the success of public health surveillance systems. Pilot tests can easily be included in public health platforms initially in one to two zoonotic disease hotspots by merging public health surveillance systems with wildlife management efforts. Peri-urban regions near wildlife conservation areas would be ideal interfaces for such pilot tests and disease hotspots would provide a more opportunistic environment to evaluate the effectiveness of reporting sick or dead animals for pathogen detections. Recent use of mobile phone technology has proven highly successful in the public health sector (e.g., 'Outbreaks Near Me' application, [29] [30] [31] FrontlineSMS, 32; EpiSurveyor, 33) . It also offers a similar utility for animal morbidity and mortality monitoring because it can easily be integrated in citizen science approaches that encourage people to report animal mortality events as well as prioritization of reporting in high-risk pathogen transmission zones, such as conservation areas and regions where agriculture and wildlife overlap. We propose that mobile-based data collection could facilitate and rapidly mobilize surveillance teams for pathogen sampling by linking reporting by the public and civil servants to alerting mechanisms with local authorities. Once local authorities are alerted, dead animals can be sampled for the presence of pathogens and surveillance efforts can be initiated if animals have tested positively for zoonotic pathogens, thus focusing surveillance on target animals, pathogens, or areas. The challenges inherent in any system requiring large-scale surveillance of potentially small targets are both in the survey and reporting. For animal morbidity or mortality surveillance, reports may be biased toward larger animals-not only because they are more visible but because carcasses may persist for a longer period of time (Santos et al. 2011 )-, animals that are found near or in human habitations, or domestic animals (Table 1 ) because of their proximity to humans and financial value.",42.013711805585366,16.098671476821274

However, even in this system, the focus is cases in wildlife, rather than companion animals (for example, in 2005 approximately 92% of the cases were in wildlife, and 8% were in domestic animals; Blanton et al., 2006) .

However, the study apparently was driven by a research goal and not as an ongoing effort, thus, not strictly matching the definition of surveillance.

Such ""civilization diseases"" include some likely acquired directly from domesticated species (e.g., measles, pertussis) or indirectly, either because domestic animals provided a more stable route of infection for pathogens to enter human populations from wildlife (e.g., smallpox) or due to the infl uence of environmental perturbation in elevating the risk of pathogen transmission to humans from wildlife hosts and vectors (e.g., falciparum malaria) (Pearce-Duvet 2006 ). All of the diseases mentioned above were at one time EIDs, highlighting how some of the emerging diseases of the recent past and present will almost certainly become the diseases of humanity in the future.

For example, porcupines, snakes, frogs, tigers, and a range of other wildlife species are farmed in Southern China for food and medicine (Abbott and van Kooten 2011 ) . While this has been debated widely as a tool for conservation (e.g., the farming of tigers to reduce poaching), it has not been proposed as a strategy to reduce the public health risks of the wildlife trade. We propose that the farming of wildlife species could reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover if similar health and biosecurity measures are applied to farmed wildlife as to livestock. In this scenario, specifi c known zoonoses are tested for, treated or infected animals removed from a farm's founder wild-caught stock, resulting in reduced risk of zoonotic pathogen ""spillover"" to ranchers, traders, or butchers. Biosecurity measures will be critical to reducing risk because the intensive production of species that potentially carry novel zoonotic agents could result in increased pandemic risk. For example, civets have long been farmed in some parts of Africa (Eniang and Daniel 2007 ; Tolosa and Regassa 2007 ) , and prior to the SARS outbreak in China in 2002, civets were farmed increasingly in China. While the role of civets in the emergence of SARS is not fully understood, it is thought that they may have acted as amplifi er hosts, expanding transmission and evolution of a bat-origin SARS-like coronavirus (Wang and Eaton 2007 ) .",52.21031185158366,20.432642148523488

These distal or upstream risk factors also include any condition or activity along any transmission pathway that intensifi es the contact rate, increases the prevalence or diversity of available pathogens to be transmitted, or elevates the likelihood of successful disease transmission given contact (Murray and Daszak 2013 ; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009 ). Distal risk factors could also include other ""enabling"" factors, such as climate or other environmental factors. The key distal factors that have been associated with the emergence of viral zoonoses from food systems are summarized in Table 2 .1 . Broadly speaking, large-scale ecosystem and environmental change, including deforestation, land-use change and conversion for agriculture, have been commonly implicated in disease emergence within food systems. Examples include the rodent-borne arenaviruses (Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Laguna Negra) that are often facilitated by agricultural land conversion, HIV which is thought to have emerged as a result of the changes in forest access and human connectivity attributable to industrial development, and Nipah and Menangle viruses which are thought to have emerged due to increasing niche overlap and contact between reservoirs and domestic animal species (see Table 2 .1 and references therein). In addition to human-induced ecosystem changes, there are a range of social and demographic factors that have also played roles as distal risk factors, including the trade of wildlife species within markets with sophisticated transport networks and in which inter-species mixing has occurred (SARS, monkeypox), or increased domestic animal stocking densities (agricultural intensifi cation) to meet growing human food demands while at the same time enhancing conditions for viral amplifi cation (HPAI, Japanese Encephalitis) (see Table 2 .1 and references therein). If the diversity of previous disease emergence mechanisms is anything to go by, forecasting disease risks within food systems should not rely solely on historical precedence. While decomposing the risks of disease emergence into subcategories of proximal and distal risk factors can seem trivial, particularly for the well-known examples examined here (Table 2 .1 ), the real utility and application of this approach is for forecasting future risks (see Sect. 4.3 below). Such horizon scanning exercises are critical for anticipating the risks associated with the growth in scale and magnitude of food systems into the future. For example, in industrial food systems, airborne transmission may potentially be an under-recognized pathway as a recent study found a million-fold elevated concentration of aerosolized invisible dust in a poultry barn fan compared to the outside air (Leibler et al. 2009 ). This could have implications for both human and animal health in addition to the spread of true airborne diseases such as Foot and Mouth disease (FMD), infl uenza, or Q fever.",52.3153256963123,20.17260640627644

For example, the primary driver of pathogen pressure for rabies virus is the prevalence of infection in key hosts (such as domestic dogs 36 ). Nonlinearities in rabies transmission generate a threshold effect in susceptible host density below which the pathogen cannot persist. These thresholds can be used to set vaccination targets for disease elimination 37 . By contrast, pathogen pressure of L. interrogans is also affected by fluctuations in reservoir host density (such as rodents 29 ), and prevalence and shedding from infected animals 29 . However, if human exposure occurs through mechanisms that aggregate and disperse pathogens shed by many individuals (through accumulation in the environment, sustained survival after exiting the host 38 , and dispersal through rain, rivers and flood waters 39 ), the detailed dynamics in reservoir hosts do not matter because they get integrated out by the environmental reservoir. In this scenario, spillover risk is determined by the aggregate pathogen pressure, human behaviours that determine exposure and the integrity of within-human barriers to infection. For example, when flooding mobilizes Leptospira spp. during the wet season in Brazil, human exposures can become widespread and epidemics of spillover infection can occur 40 . During these extreme environmental events, control efforts must focus on preventing exposure to contaminated sources (for example, by wearing protective clothing and boots 41 ) and reducing the infectious inoculum rather than reducing the source of pathogen shedding, as the release of Leptospira spp. into the environment by animal reservoirs occurs before the extreme precipitation. Similarly, pathogen pressure of E. coli O157 is affected by the density of its cattle host population 42 , by variation in shedding among individuals and by prevalence in herds 43 . Each of these factors can be highly skewed and seasonal 44, 45 . If spillover events are driven by contact between humans and cattle, then variation in pathogen load among animals would interact with nonlinear doseresponse functions to determine spillover risk (see below). However, this individual variation matters less if human exposure to exposure through different routes of transmission 52 . Human behaviours, such as occupational interactions with reservoir host animals, the consumption of certain animal products or the use of particular environments, may increase the risk of infection 53 .",47.58982776411828,18.362811060577233

Contact events can occur in many different contexts but their common feature is that they provide the opportunity for the transmission of a pathogen. Transmission interfaces could include: human-wildlife, human-vector, human-domestic animal, human-human, wildlife-vector, wildlife-domestic animal, and vector-domestic animal contact. The diversity of types of contact that have been relevant historically for the emergence of viral zoonoses from wildlife associated with food systems is summarized in Table 2 .1 . In wild harvest systems, contact events have typically occurred directly between a person and a range of wildlife species ultimately used for food (HIV, Ebola, SARS, Lassa, Monkeypox), via contact activities such as hunting, handling, butchering, consumption, and trade. In animal production systems, people have become infected most commonly from contact with domestic animals that had fi rst been exposed to wildlife pathogens (e.g., HPAI infl uenza, Nipah, Menangle), where tending and treating domestic animals for illness resulted in human infection. Japanese Encephalitis represents an example where humans are infected when bitten by mosquito vectors, which acquire and maintain infection after feeding on wild hosts or infected domestic species (e.g., pigs). For diseases more diffusely associated with agricultural activities, infection often occurs via contact with virus present in wildlife excreta (e.g., hantaviruses) or fomites (see Table 2 .1 and references therein).",49.583625046733744,17.989835965050563

Thus, future studies of wildlife isolates at the molecular level are paramount for refining the host range, transmission dynamics and zoonotic potential of known and novel Giardia and Cryptosporidium species and genotypes. Future studies must be undertaken in defined locations in which host assemblages and their interactions are well understood so that the results of genotyping studies can be put into an ecological context.

Within-host barriers to infection vary widely and depend on the specific combinations of pathogen, host species and Figure 3 | Bottlenecks to spillover. Different barriers permit or constrain the flow of pathogens from one species to another. The figure is illustrative, owing to the lack of sufficient data for more than one or two barriers for any given system. The width of the gaps in barriers represents the ease with which a pathogen can flow through the barriers and will vary depending on context. The question marks represent points at which the barriers are especi ally poorly understood and highlight gaps in our knowledge of some patho gens that are of global concern (for example, the lack of information on disease dynamics in reservoir hosts of Ebola virus). Many rabies virus reservoirs, such as domestic dogs, are widely distributed. The prevalence of rabies virus is generally low and the incidence of spillover closely tracks the prevalence of infection in the reservoir host. Rabies virus is almost always fatal to spillover hosts 25 . Interventions are usually aimed at reducing the preva lence in reservoir hosts through vaccination 37 . Leptospira interrogans survives in water and soil after being shed in the urine of a wide range of rodents and other reservoir hosts 29 . Key bottlenecks to the zoonotic spillover of this patho gen are exposure and within-host barriers. For example, during floods in Brazil, many humans that are exposed do not become infected, probably because the initial within-host barrier, the skin, is not penetrated 41 . However, once L. interrogans penetrates the skin (for example, through skin wounds), 1-10 leptospires may be sufficient to cause systemic infection 110 . Therefore, wearing protective clothing and boots is an effective control measure 41 . Important bottlenecks to Escherichia coli O157 spillover include heterogeneous shedding from cattle 43, 44 (although it is still unknown whether super-shedding is a characteristic of particular individuals or is a transient phase that occurs in most cattle 42 ). In some contexts, exposure is an important bottleneck; for example, when the pathogen is eliminated from food through cooking. Widespread dispersal leads to uncertainties about the source of many outbreaks 46, 47 , and weak within-human barriers enable low doses of E. coli to cause infection 49, 50 . Humans are frequently exposed to Toxoplasma gondii carried by domestic cats and intermediate hosts, but the parasite rarely causes disease because most humans have strong within-host immunological barriers. Cats are widely and densely distributed, but the prevalence of T. gondii is low and cats shed oocysts only once in their lifetime 111 . However, sporulated oocysts survive in the environment for long periods of time 112 . Limiting exposure to oocysts may prevent spillover; however, this is challenging when it is unclear whether cats or the environment are the major sources of infection in humans 111, 113 . Ebola virus has not been isolated from bats and the definitive reservoir bat species is unknown 114 ; therefore, characteristics of infection in bats are unknown 114, 115 . The pathogen is released through excretion or slaughter, then survives for up to a week, depending on the environmental conditions 116 . The most tractable bottlenecks for intervention may be the zoonotic exposure of humans through interaction with bats, bushmeat or the carcasses of other species 97, 117, 118 , because once exposed, the within-host barriers to Ebola virus may be extremely low 119 . pathogen 60, 61 . Even when pathogens can replicate within cells, several barriers can prevent their transmission to other cells 62, 63 and thus the establishment of an infection. For example, avian influenza virus must pass through a series of within-host barriers to infect a human, including mucins in respiratory tract excretions, specific receptor molecules that constrain virus entry into cells and have different distributions in the respiratory tracts of different host species, suboptimal viral polymerase that restricts the ability of the virus to replicate in cells of the human respiratory tract, viral neuraminidase that is inefficient in its role in the release of influenza viruses from infected cells, and innate immune responses that are initiated early and that block infection in both infected and neighbouring cells 63, 64 .",42.94543247617693,16.885441357087036

Second, the movement and behaviour of hosts affect contact and the likelihood of exposure within and between species.

Collectively, these processes determine how the pathogen is distributed across reservoir host populations. Such pathogen distribution can be highly variable (for example, pulses of Sin Nombre virus infections in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) populations in response to climate-driven increases in population density) 22 , or stable (as illustrated by Mycobacterium bovis infections in populations of livestock and wildlife) 23 . Figure 1 | Pathways to spillover. The risk of spillover is determined by a series of processes that link the ecological dynamics of infection in reservoir hosts, the microbiological and vector determinants of survival and dissemination outside of reservoir hosts, the epidemiological and behavioural determinants of exposure, and the within-host biological factors that shape the susceptibility of recipient hosts. The distribution and intensity of infection in reservoir hosts, followed by pathogen release, movement, survival and possible development to infectious stage, determine the pathogen pressure, which is defined as the amount of pathogen available to the recipient host at a given point in space and time.

We need models to reveal the points of vulnerability where intervention against zoonoses will be most effective, and to highlight the gaps in data collection. We need to know when particular zoonotic phases, i.e., reservoir transmission, spillover from animals to humans, stuttering transmission or incipient outbreaks among humans, can be targeted to optimize epidemiological outcomes while reducing cost. How should health policy be adapted to account for environmental change or regional differences in ecology and sociology? How might zoonotic pathogens evolve in response to anthropogenic forces or control strategies? Dynamical models, rooted in data, provide an essential framework for addressing these critical questions. (A) Schematic diagram of zoonotic transmission dynamics. Zoonoses can involve as many as four dynamical phases, including enzootic or epizootic circulation in the animal reservoir, spillover transmission from animals to humans, and sometimes self-limiting stuttering chains of human-to-human transmission or sustained transmission leading to outbreaks. Adapting Wolfe et al. (6) , we classify zoonotic pathogens into three stages (II, III, and IV) according to their transmissibility among humans. (B) The spillover force of infection is determined by the product of three major components. The force of infection is defined as the per capita rate of infection of susceptible humans. Beneath each major component is a list of contributing factors drawn from many disciplines; these factors may pertain to all zoonoses or to particular transmission modes, as indicated.

Its threat is therefore limited to spillover from avian hosts that maintain it in a region. One might argue that evolution of transmission from person to mosquito could transform West Nile virus into a major threat in countries with mosquito-proof dwellings. But the evidence from malaria and dengue suggests otherwise. Even if a mutation allowed some transmission from human to mosquito, this toehold has little chance of leading to sustained transmission from mosquito to human when infrastructures block sustained mosquito-borne transmission of pathogens that are well adapted to transmission from humans to mosquitoes. The Plasmodium agents of human malaria and dengue virus, for example, have highly evolved abilities for transmission from human to mosquito; yet they could not maintain themselves in the US, even though Plasmodium once did, and the yellow fever virus, a relative of the dengue virus, once spread epidemically in the US.

Wolfe et al. (3) proposed a useful classification scheme for pathogens, delineating five stages spanning the range from those exclusively infecting animals (stage I) to those exclusively infecting humans (stage V). The zoonotic component of this scheme (stages II-IV) can be divided into the constituent phases of transmission and associated epidemiological mechanisms (Fig. 1A) . Stage II pathogens are those, like West Nile virus or Brucella abortus, that can transmit from animals to humans to cause 'primary' infections but do not exhibit human-to-human ('secondary') transmission. Stage III pathogens, such as monkeypox virus and Leishmania infantum, spill over into human populations from animal reservoirs and can cause limited cycles of human-to-human transmission that stutter to extinction. Stage IV pathogens persist in animal reservoirs but can cause self-sustaining chains of transmission in human populations; examples include Yersinia pestis (plague) and pandemic influenza. Our approach diverges from Wolfe et al. by basing the distinction among stages II-IV on the basic reproductive number, R 0 , from the perspective of the human 'spillover' hosts. This quantity, defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious individual in a wholly susceptible population, is a central concept in epidemiological theory (14, 15) . R 0 enables us to distinguish stages II-IV on dynamical grounds since it quantitatively demarcates pathogens capable of sustained transmission among humans (those with R 0 >1) from those doomed to stutter to local extinction (R 0 <1) or those with no onward transmission (R 0 =0). The dynamics of all zoonoses involve multiple phases, including transmission in the animal reservoir, spillover transmission into humans, and possibly stuttering or sustained transmission among humans. Cross-species spillover transmission is the defining characteristic of a zoonosis, and examination of the factors influencing the force of infection from animals to humans (Fig.  1B ) reveals three distinct components: the prevalence of infection in the animal reservoir, the rate at which humans come into contact with these animals, and the probability that humans become infected when contact occurs. These components are each influenced by diverse properties of natural, agricultural and human systems, with important differences driven by the pathogen's mode of transmission. Significant quantitative or qualitative differences may also arise between zoonoses that use wildlife rather than domesticated animals as reservoirs, owing to differences in frequency, duration and nature of crossspecies contacts and in opportunities for human intervention (Fig. 1 ).",40.7849822730292,15.210362717674592

In many countries where public health infrastructure is rudimentary, deteriorating, or nonexistent, efforts to improve the ability to conduct electronic disease surveillance include more robust data collection methods and enhanced analysis capability (6, 7) . However, in these parts of the world, basing timely and sensitive reporting of public health threats on conventional surveillance sources remains challenging. Lack of resources and trained public health professionals poses a substantial roadblock (8) (9) (10) . Furthermore, reporting emerging infectious diseases has certain constraints, including fear of repercussions on trade and tourism, delays in clearance through multiple levels of government, tendency to err on the conservative side, and inadequately functioning or nonexistent surveillance infrastructure (11) . Even with the recent enactment of international health regulations in 2005, no guarantee yet exists that broad compliance will be feasible, given the challenges associated with reporting mechanisms and multilateral coordination (12) .",35.887258246527686,12.925226056943636

However, for most pathogens, we still have a limited understanding of how this affects epidemiology, persistence and virulence of infections-including several zoonotic pathogens that reside in wild animal reservoirs and spillover into humans. In this chapter, we review the current knowledge of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) as host for pathogens. This species is widely distributed, often occupying habitats close to humans and livestock, and is an important game bird species and the ancestor to domestic ducks-thereby being an excellent model species to highlight aspects of the wildlife, domestic animal interface and the relevance for human health. We discuss mallard as host for a range of pathogens but focus more in depth of it as a reservoir host for influenza A virus (IAV). Over the last decades, IAV research has surged, prompted in part to the genesis and spread of highly pathogenic virus variants that have been devastating to domestic poultry and caused a number of human spillover infections. The aim of this chapter is to synthesise and review the intricate interactions of virus, host and environmental factors governing IAV epidemiology and evolution.",52.56574233869767,19.367484095444475

For physical factors, 79 percent of the hospitals reported having excessive heat, 77.5 percent identified noise as a risk factor, and 76 percent noted low light as an occupational risk factor. 13 When individual HCWs (88,667) in these hospitals were surveyed the frequency with which risks were experienced on the job was less than that reported by the hospitals overall. Thirtytwo percent of HCWs reported experiencing ergonomic risk factors on the job; 26 percent identified biological risk factors, 12 percent noted the presence of chemical risk factors in their job, 18 percent reported psychosocial risk factors on their job, and 18 percent of the HCWs reported unsafe working conditions. For physical hazards, 5.9 percent of HCWs identified excessive heat as a risk factor on their job, 7.1 percent identified noise, and 12.4 percent noted low light as a job-related risk factor. The discrepancy in the reporting of occupational risk factors by direct line HCWs compared to the hospital administrators is most likely due to the unit of analysis, the hospital overall versus individual HCWs.

As a result, there are more domesticated ducks in China than there are wild mallards across the globe. These large numbers, specifically the large input of young birds, are imperative in the maintenance of infection diseases. Thus, it is a combination of large distribution range, large population size and turnover rate in wild mallards and enormous population size of farmed ducks, most of which are free-range, that make mallard one of the largest aquatic reservoir hosts for diseases.

Correspondingly, contact with poultry and rodents/ shrews, as well as with carnivores, was identified in the LASSO regression as being associated with self-reported ILI and/or SARI symptoms, with results varying by income and province. It's important to note that the questionnaire used broad classification of the type of animals for these exposures due to the presumed variability in respondent's capacity to identify species or genera of wildlife. It is likely that the most significant exposure we identified (to carnivores) reflects animals as diverse as civets, porcupines, ferret badgers and taxas that respondents recognized as nonrodent and non-shrew. This study also assessed health risks from human interaction activities for each study participant in the survey based on their travel history and the health history of people who they lived with. The goal was to minimize the possibility that illness was caused by human-tohuman transmission of pathogens causing ILI and/or SARI symptoms. We did not find evidence supporting a direct relationship between bat contact and bat coronavirus sero-positivity in the human population. However, there is frequent contact with domestic animals in these communities and it is known that other bat-borne viruses have been transmitted to humans via livestock (e.g. henipavirses and filoviruses) [38] [39] [40] [41] .

Spillover infections from other non-avian hosts are also possible but occur much less frequently or may be underappreciated. First, due to high genetic similarity and sharing habitat with domesticated conspecifics or utilising habitat surrounding intensive poultry farms, there is a high risk for spillover infections from both gallinaceous poultry and domesticated ducks (e.g. Christensen et al. 1998; Wang et al. 2008; Shin et al. 2000 Shin et al. , 2002 . Indeed, pathogens more frequently found in poultry are identified in wild mallards but very infrequently (Table 9 .1). These pathogens are usually only detected in wild mallards utilising habitat surrounding poultry farms as they are used as sentinels. For example, avian pneumovirus has been detected in mallard sentinels and wild mallards in the vicinity of poultry operations (Shin et al. 2000 (Shin et al. , 2002 . Given the large population sizes of birds reared for meat production, one can hypothesise that the occurrence of spillover of poultry-associated pathogens into mallard and other wild bird populations is underestimated. Although modern poultry production units enforce barrier protection, no system can truly be regarded closed-and in many parts of the world, poultry are reared in open units or are let free to roam the environments exposing a large wildlife/domestic animal interface. The extent of this can be exemplified with repeated isolation of bacteria in wild birds with antibiotic resistance profiles suggesting origin in anthropogenic environments (e.g. Stedt et al. 2014; Hasan et al. 2014; Hernandez et al. 2013; Bonnedahl et al. 2014 ).",37.70861097590199,14.329404183682053

This is reflected by the adaptation of particular pathogens to their hosts, the efficiency of the parasite to exploit the host effectively for replication and, crucially, the transmission to new hosts. In order to ascertain the specific role of each host species in pathogen epidemiology, it is imperative to combine large screening efforts, molecular-based phylogeny approaches and infection experiments, which unfortunately is rarely met. Compounded with this, we have limited understanding of the role of mallards as hosts for pathogens: are these birds the central reservoir, important but not central to the epidemiology or merely permissive to spillover infection? Moreover, variation in pathogen phenotypic characteristics is usually unknown, such as variation in virulence, pathogenicity, survival in the environment and duration of infection. These properties will depend on both host and pathogen and likely are variable among genetic variants and/or strains of the pathogen. Regardless, our current catalogue of disease-causing agents is probably an underestimation, and with the advent of deep sequencing and more sensitive screening tools, we will likely uncover numerous new disease-causing agents such as picornaviruses (Woo et al. 2010) or disentangle complex epidemiology of known pathogens in new hosts such as coronaviruses ).",36.29051508522816,14.185569913246985

Historically, there have been several profound and distinct transitions in human environmental and interpopulation interactions that have radically changed the spectrum and causes of infectious disease in human populations (Table 1) Vertical grey arrows represent (from left to right): (1) rabies (dead-end transmission to human through bites of infected dogs or bats); (2) Ebola virus (transmission to humans through contact of hunters with infected gorillas or chimpanzees followed by several cycles of humanto-human transmission that suddenly stop); (3) yellow fever (mosquito-borne transmission from monkeys to humans that can be maintained from human to (mosquito) to human for many cycles (in contrast to Japanese encephalitis virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes from an avian or porcine reservoir to humans but is -due to low viral load in blood -not transmitted from human to mosquito)); and (4) HIV (several transmission events of related viruses from apes and monkeys to humans followed by sustained local and pandemic human to human transmission). into all geographic areas of the world, the globalization of economic activities and culture, the speed and accessibility of distant contact, the spread and intensification of urbanization, and our increasing reliance on either intricate or massive technology, are reshaping the relations between humans and microbes. 5 The species jump: the species jump that initiates a first human infection by a new agent is often brought about by a novel or unusual physical contact between potential pathogen and human. Such contacts usually occur because of cultural, social, behavioural or technological change on the part of humans that affects the humaneanimal interface. The potential for subsequent spread of this 'new' infectious disease will depend on many different factors, including environmental or social factors. These changes and factors are the drivers of emergence and are listed in Table 2 . 2 Biologically, the species jump is often more a transition process involving several stages rather than a single event. These stages are displayed in Figure 1 . 6 The pathogen has to overcome various biological barriers (interspecies, intrahuman and interhuman) to move from one stage to the next, to be able finally to cause sustained human-to-human transmission. 7 Based on data from 1940 onwards, the hotspots for emergence of infectious diseases were mapped for zoonotic infections from wildlife and domestic animals, and for drug-resistant and vector-borne organisms. Figure 2 shows that these hotspots are primarily located in South and South East Asia, South and Central America and Subsaharan Africa. 8, 9 Various international consortia and large research programmes have been established in an attempt to predict and prevent, or prepare for and mitigate, these novel emergence events, summarized in a recent issue of The Lancet. 8 Technical advances enable us to detect and characterize these agents much more rapidly than ever before (e.g. availability of whole genome sequences of influenza virus A/H7N9 influenza or Escherichia coli O104:H4 within days). 10, 11 Non-zoonotic emergence",36.24557648621878,14.147064886321706

Diseases that affect wildlife are relatively neglected but may affect the wild food chain, the farmed food chain (as diseases do not recognize farm fences), the economic health of the agricultural sector, and, in the case of zoonosis, human health. There is also a great need to assess how surveillance is occurring in wildlife and whether there are appropriate response policies in place to address wildlife health. In addition, other complex health threats such as antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in animals and humans and accidental introduction of pathogens to plants, animals, or humans should be of high concern. 20,21 Multidisciplinary approaches are needed at the local, national, and global levels to prevent and mitigate crises at the interfaces between humans, animals, and the environment. 22, 23 To ensure sustainability, the One Health Security approach to wildlife disease should be based, to the maximum extent possible, in already existing structures to conserve financial resources and avoid duplication of effort. 24 Even though the connectedness of humans with their environment is now generally acknowledged, the veterinary, human, and environmental health disciplines have in large part remained separate in their work and professional training. The past decade has seen great strides in changing this, including integrated surveillance initiatives, 25, 26 new education and training programs focused on One Health, 27, 28 and research to study how diseases in animals become threats to human health and how changes in the environment affect animal, human, and plant health. 29 The addition of security experts and professionals for One Health Security adds another layer by connecting law enforcement, public health, animal health, and plant health. The One Health Security approach is not an additional agenda but rather an important subset of the GHSA, which should incorporate law enforcement and security throughout. While this approach is necessary, and shared responsibility among security, agriculture, and health sectors is needed in the GHSA, it will remain complicated to integrate these diverse disciplines. 30 Nonetheless, the objectives of the GHSA depend on the integration of One Health concerns as well as security and law enforcement in order to adequately prevent, detect, and respond to emerging natural and deliberate biological threats.",38.0563164371911,13.815311748810824

These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and it is conceivable that the evidence for either one may differ for different diseases. The perturbation hypothesis assumes that changes in the environment may disturb an equilibrium that is associated with lower risks of transmission of viruses from wildlife to humans. What exactly that equilibrium is may differ for each ecosystem and its components, including the animals and pathogens in there. The second hypothesis, the pathogen pool hypothesis, assumes that disease emergence related to change of land use is explained by increased exposure of humans (or animals, as intermediate hosts) to a rich pool of pathogens from which they were separated before the change occurred.

A Review,"According to Holmes (2013) , there are some evolutionary and ecological generalities that may allow large-scale predictions of interspecific transmission. A well-established rule is that pathogens are more likely to ""jump"" between phylogenetically related hosts. For example, Streicker et al. (2010) demonstrated that frequencies of interspecies transmission of the rabies virus decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between bat host species. Yet such phylogenetic barrier appears to be less significant for viruses than it is for other pathogens. Davies and Pedersen (2008) studied different pathogen communities (protozoans, helminthes, and viruses) in primates and humans and observed that-for viruses-host phylogenetic distance is less important than geography in explaining pathogen community similarity between hosts. They suggested that geographical overlap between neighboring hosts is more relevant due to the rapid evolution of viral lineages allowing them to ""jump"" hosts across larger evolutionary distances.

For such a plan to be feasible for emerging viruses it would be necessary to judge the potential risk posed by a virus not yet known to infect humans. Epizootic disease in livestock or wild animals is used as a threat indicator for some known zoonotic viruses, such as influenza, Rift Valley Fever virus, and West Nile virus, but there is no assurance that an agent potentially pathogenic to humans will cause noticeable disease in animal hosts. Coronaviruses closely related and putatively ancestral to SARS virus, for example, seem not to cause disease in host bats [56] . The extent of animal disease surveillance is also far less in the tropics than even the poorest human clinical networks so the likelihood of recognizing an unusual event is less. Periodic sampling of animals can discover novel viruses but is too infrequent and limited to be surveillance. Considerable attention has been given to human contact with bush meat, or animals captured for food [5] . While harvesting and slaughtering wild animals appear to have provided the mechanism by which some important pathogens have emerged, such as HIV and SARS, it has not played a role in the emergence of many others, including the three examples discussed in this paper: lujo, Heartland and MERS-CoV. Vectors obviate the need of direct human-mammal or human-bird contact and can move viruses across ecological zones. Sequencing and cataloging the viruses of animals in selected areas can provide valuable insight to transmission dynamics and phylogenetics but, as discussed, cannot yet be used to predict. One must wonder if the US $6.3 billion proposed to catalog mammalian viruses not yet known to be pernicious [26] would not be better spent on developing more suitable diagnostic tests for humans in remote areas most liable to emerging pathogen risk or on conducting sentinel human surveillance. Ultimately, the best indication that a pathogen has the ability to jump to humans is finding it in humans [57] .",35.120266976740545,14.463092533722822

A Review,"In particular, large and dense reservoir populations may be predictive of a large pathogen load and virulence (Anderson et al. 1992 ). Because of this, certain species of bats (Calisher et al. 2006 ) and bird species (Cui et al. 2014 ) are being increasingly recognized as major reservoirs for several viruses. Remarkably, it has been reported that bats can serve as reservoir hosts of a greater viral diversity than other host species, for example, rodents (Luis et al. 2013; O'Shea et al. 2014) . Such reservoir capabilities of bats may arise, firstly, because of their roosting behavior in large and dense congregations that greatly promote transmission and, secondly, because of their flying capabilities and ample home ranges that potentially allow them to translocate viral strains across large geographic regions. Drexler et al. (2012) suggested a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds. In fact, they placed bats as tentative ancestral hosts to both the major Paramyxoviridae subfamilies (Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae).

Pathogens spilling over from wildlife reservoirs, either directly or via intermediate hosts, were the basis of most of the outbreaks. Striking examples in humans were the emergence of AIDS from chimpanzees, avian flu from migratory birds, and SARS, MERS, and Ebola virus disease from bat reservoirs. A complex mix of predisposing factors in our globalizing world, linked to major changes in the societal environment and global ecology, collectively created opportunities for viruses and other pathogens to infect and adapt to new animal and human hosts. This paved the way for the unprecedented spread of infections, with dramatic consequences for public and animal health, animal welfare, food supplies, economies, and biodiversity. It is important to realize that, because of the complex and largely interactive nature of the predisposing factors, it is virtually impossible to predict the next pathogen threat, where it will come from and when it will strike. However, a better understanding of the underlying processes may eventually lead to enhanced predictive capacity, improving preparedness for outbreaks in humans and animals.

However, pathogen exposure may not be a simple function of the presence or absence of a large domestic dog population at some identified interface. CDV and other multi-host canine pathogens can infect a wide variety of wild and domestic carnivore hosts increasing potential for pathogen maintenance in the system through interspecies transmission [43] . In general, individual wild carnivore species are unlikely to occur at sufficient densities to attain critical community size necessary to maintain most pathogens. Domestic dogs, dependent on population number and required critical community size for a pathogen could be considered non-maintenance or maintenance populations for a pathogen [14] . Coupling all susceptible species populations together could constitute a maintenance community irrespective of the size of a particular species component. Therefore even small and low density domestic dog populations could provide the ecosystem with the pathogen flow to allow invasion into a diverse community of susceptible hosts which together reach the critical community size required for pathogen invasion and onward transmission.",39.180503962669036,14.816132607441784

In addition, the diseases these vaccines are designed to prevent may be so mild or self-limiting that the risks associated with administering the vaccines may be greater than the actual disease. Lastly, some vaccines may interfere with common screening methods for disease detection, and are therefore not recommended unless absolutely warranted for a specific individual. It is the burden of the practitioner, along with the pet owner, to make decisions regarding which, if any, of the noncore vaccines should be administered to a puppy. 3, [6] [7] [8] Leptospirosis A bacterial pathogen that causes acute hepatic and renal disease, leptospirosis is typically transmitted through urine of infected animals (reservoir hosts include dogs, rats, wildlife, and livestock), and in contaminated water.

However, a dog that frequents rural environments or has exposure to waterways or livestock is definitely at risk of infection and should therefore be protected against the disease. Again, the initial puppy appointments should involve a through history and include the owner's plans for the dog's future use. If an owner brings a Labrador retriever puppy to the veterinarian for ""whatever vaccines he needs,"" it is up to the practitioner to ask ""will he be a hunting dog, will he be used in field trials, will he be exposed to wildlife and waterways?"" The Border Collie who lives on a working sheep ranch surely should be vaccinated appropriately against leptospirosis.

This model promotes the view that diarrheal disease could be transmitted through food, flies, fields, fingers, and fluids and played a key role in developing a framework for the multiple pathways of environmental transmission of infectious diseases (Curtis et al., 2000; Eisenberg et al., 2012; Kawata, 1978; Wagner and Lanoix, 1958) . Most pathogens that are excreted into the environment usually die. However, some of them reach fingers, fluids, new hosts such as flies, and floor or surfaces that are used for food preparation or eating. From any of these sites, pathogens may reach food and infect a new human host. All these transmission routes can be blocked by changes in domestic hygiene practices (Curtis et al., 2000) . This model envisions two types of barriers to reduce disease transmission. Preventing transmission at the level of the primary barriers prevents the entry of the pathogens into the environment, and these initiatives are the most effective interventions to prevent disease transmission.

Moreover, sequencing data have demonstrated that bats serve as a reservoir of coronaviruses that have the potential to cross the species barrier and infect humans.

While identifying the source of an outbreak is decisive for successfully limiting it and for preventing recurrences, implementation of the interventions is often delayed or complicated by various factors, such as the increased distances to which food products are transported, the increasing global mobility of populations, and the many processes and locations that are often involved in food preparation. This is compounded by the existence of several transmission routes and various transmission vehicles that can be exploited by certain pathogens. More than 250 known foodborne diseases affect one-third of the world population, and some segments of the population, particularly the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, are an a heightened risk, pointing toward the relevance of these conditions for medicine and public health. Foodborne illnesses can be transmitted through vectors, fomites, contaminated food products, directly by person-to-person contact, from animals, or through the airborne route.

Infection by an oral pathogen is defined as the multiplication of organisms within the host, followed by excretion (Haas et al., 1999) and, for the purpose of the work here does not include progression of disease or the host acquired immune response. Obtaining dose-response data for humans has generally relied on volunteer challenge experiments e.g. Cryptosporidium parvum in students (Okhuysen et al., 1998) or using outbreak data to back-calculate the relationship between measured exposures and infection rates (Teunis et al., 2004) . There are limitations to both approaches particularly with emerging pathogens for which the exposure routes may not be fully elucidated, and for pathogens with serious clinical outcomes, e.g. Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV). Furthermore zoonotic viruses emerge through jumping the species barrier from an animal source to humans, e.g. Nipah virus (NiV) and EBOV, and in this respect the dose response would be for a one-off event that may be inefficient and difficult to reproduce without large numbers of animals. An additional complication is that the pathogen may adapt to the new host, such that its infectivity increases. This is well established for filoviruses in laboratory animals where the infectivity per plaque-forming unit (pfu) may change by several orders of magnitude with passaging (Gale et al., 2016) , and has recently been demonstrated for EBOV Makona adapting to humans through an amino acid substitution in its glycoprotein during the recent catastrophic outbreak in West Africa (Diehl et al., 2016; Urbanowicz et al., 2016) . That outbreak also raised many questions regarding the unknown potential for companion animals (cats and dogs) to serve either as a reservoir or vector for the virus and so be involved in transmission of EBOV to humans and other animals. The absence of dose-response data for EBOV in humans limits development of MRAs for the risk of infection of citizens in the EU for example from EBOV in illegally imported bushmeat. Indeed, it has been proposed that the infectivity to humans of an EBOV pfu may differ not only from bushmeat samples from different wildlife species (e.g. fruits bats and nonhuman primates) but also from different individuals of the same species depending on the degree of host adaptation (Gale et al., 2016) . In effect no two pieces of bushmeat from EBOVinfected wildlife may be the same in terms of infectivity to humans, although this remains to be proved. There is clearly a need for novel approaches to calibrate dose-response relationships for the purposes of MRA for emerging pathogens.",32.8442293067775,12.695360799233182

The fi rst case of human monkeypox was identifi ed in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with subsequent outbreaks in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Côte d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Democratic Republic of the Congo (reviewed by Reynolds et al. 2010 ; Rimoin et al. 2010 ) . Recent MPX increases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere have been attributed to cessation of the human smallpox vaccine, which conferred some immunity to other pox viruses . Human and nonhuman primate infections are suspected to result from wildlife exposure such as would occur in bushmeat-related activities; infected species include squirrels (e.g., Thomas's rope squirrel, Funisciurus anerythrus ; Khodakevich et al. 1986 ; African ground squirrels; Xerus sp.; Reynolds et al. 2010 ) , dormice ( Graphiurus sp.; Reynolds et al. 2010 ) , and giant pouched rats ( Cricetomys sp.; Reynolds et al. 2010 ) . The outbreak that occurred in the USA in 2007 after exposure to rodents in the illegal pet trade also linked human monkeypox to rope squirrels, dormice, and pouched rats (Hutson et al. 2007 ). While dormice are small and not likely to be the target of hunting, the diurnal and highly visible squirrels and the giant pouched rats are routinely hunted (Taylor et al. 2015 ) , making the spillover to humans highly plausible. Jones et al. ( 2008 ) list 54.3 % of EID events as being caused by bacteria and there is good evidence to suggest that bacterial pathogens have the potential to be just as important as viruses when it comes to those that may spillover due to bushmeat-related activities, but in this capacity they have received far less attention (Cantas and Suer 2014 ) . Transmission pathways for bacterial pathogens can occur through direct exposure to body fl uids or feces, but they can also possibly be transferred indirectly through exposure to disease vectors such as fl eas and ticks when handling animals. In a rare survey of bacterial pathogens that might spillover via bushmeat-related activities, Bachand et al. ( 2012 ) sampled muscle from 128 bushmeat carcasses from multiple species at markets in Gabon for the presence of Campylobacter , Salmonella , and Shigella . While they only recorded the presence of Salmonella , the potential for contamination and thus spillover of enteric pathogens from carcass handling remains high, especially in the days after purchase when pathogens continue to replicate. Bacteria in the genus Leptospira are endemic sub-Saharan African pathogens that have a high risk of spillover during bushmeatrelated activities as they are shed in urine. Jobbins and Alexander ( 2015 ) documented their widespread presence in wild mammals, birds, and reptiles, highlighting the role that wildlife may play in leptospirosis. The bushmeat interface may also play a role in human cases of anthrax, caused by Bacillis anthracis , which is largely a disease of grazing herbivorous mammals, but to which common chimpanzees are also susceptible (Leendertz et al. 2004 ). If bushmeat includes not only the hunting of apparently healthy animals but also sick animals or salvage of contaminated carcasses, the risk of human outbreaks increases (Hang'ombe et al. 2012 ) .",36.00959414556048,14.404273031255082

Expansion of hog farms by deforestation increased contact of fruit bats with hogs. In addition, planting of fruit orchards near hog farms caused localized habitat sinks that contributed to increased contact between bats and hogs, leading to virus spillover. Once virus entered the hog population, transmission to humans occurred, which lead to human to human transmission. Thus, agricultural intensifi cation likely contributed to the transmission of virus to humans in the Malaysian outbreak (Pulliam et al. 2012 ) .",33.213849099771714,14.39060570528486

However, these species are unlikely reservoirs as high mortality rates rule out an indefinite infection chain (Leroy et al. 2004; Bermejo et al. 2006; Wittmann et al. 2007 ). Scientists are therefore searching for other hosts where EBOV circulate without major negative effects; fruit bats have received the most research attention and are frequently referred to as the reservoir for African EBOV (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2014b; O'Shea et al. 2014; World Health Organization 2014) . We review current evidence and highlight that fruit bats may not represent the main, or the sole, reservoir. We discuss evidence implicating insectivorous bats and reiterate that bats themselves might not be the ultimate reservoir for EBOV.

From this, it follows that emerging pathogens are not an arbitrary selection of all pathogens. Becoming established in a human host typically requires adaptations, often for increased virulence, as has been documented in HIV (Wain et al. 2007 ; Etienne et al. 2013 ) . Generalist pathogens have the ability to infect more than one host species and have higher relative emergence risk than pathogens that are very hostspecifi c (Cleaveland et al. 2007 ); this is especially true for pathogens that can infect species in more than one taxonomic order. One example of this generalist ""broad"" host range is found in the newly described African henipavirus, which can enter and infect cells of nonhuman primates, bats, and humans (Lawrence et al. 2014 ) .",38.38596644936155,14.022850609355693

Despite a lot of efforts to identify the natural reservoir of filoviruses in the last decade, little progress has been made. RNA of ZEBOV was detected in rodents and shrews captured in the Central African Republic, although serology and virus isolation were negative. In several outbreaks of filovirus infections, index cases were associated with visiting a cave or cave-like environments inhabited by bats. Experimental infections of fruit and insectivorous bats showed that filoviruses replicate to high titres in several organs (Swanepoel et al, 1996) . Up to three weeks after infection, ZEBOV RNA could still be recovered from faecal samples. Furthermore, infected bats did not develop disease signs, which is an important condition to function as a natural host in which the virus might persist. Recently, evidence was presented that three species of fruit bats caught near affected villages at the Gabon-Congo border, harboured RNA sequences of ZEBOV . The three bat species have a broad geographical range that includes the regions where filovirus outbreaks had occurred. The sequences recovered cluster with strains found during human outbreaks, providing strong indications for the involvement of these bats in either transmission of EBOV to humans or to other types of introduction of the virus into new areas. There is evidence to suggest that the reservoir for MARV can be found in the same or related bat species (Towner et al, 2007a) . However, it is not completely clear how humans and non-human primates may become infected by bats.

The concept of immunizing wild animal reservoirs for the prevention of disease in humans or domestic animals is even more challenging and has received limited attention. Moreover, human and animal health divisions of the biopharmaceutical industry are generally separate and segregated, and there is no organized approach to the development of new vaccines indicated for the prevention of spread of diseases from domestic or wild animals to humans.

Low virulence allows infected host individuals to survive, and pathogens can have more chance to spread to other host individuals. If pathogens have high virulence, they can propagate within an infected host individual, but risk killing the infected host and limiting their spread to other hosts. Trade-offs between reproduction within a host and transmission among hosts is a well-studied explanation for the evolution of reduced virulence (Anderson and May 1982; Alizon et al. 2009 ). However, the balance (or equilibrium) of this trade-off can differ depending on biological characters of pathogens. Ewald (1993) discussed how transmission mechanisms of pathogens can alter the predicted trajectory of virulence evolution. Highly virulent diseases tend to immobilize hosts in early stage of infection. Therefore, if pathogens are mainly transmitted by contacts between hosts, higher virulence would greatly decrease chances of new transmission. However, if pathogens can survive outside of the host and can be transmitted by air, water or vectors in which they are not virulent, host immobility should have less effect on the chances of new transmission. Ewald (1993) noted that such pathogens, such as smallpox, tuberculosis or diphtheria, are often more virulent than pathogens that depend more directly on hosts for transmission. Other factors can affect the balance of the trade-off and allow evolution of high virulence (Galvani 2003) . For example, if multiple pathogen strains infect simultaneously and compete within individual hosts, high reproduction rate within a host (leading to high virulence) may be favored. In sexually-transmitted diseases, frequent exchange of sexual partners makes transmission of pathogens between hosts easier and as a result cause high virulence. This may be the case of HIV in human society (Lipsitch and Nowak 1995) .",34.732225038445534,12.310154872504661

The very high number of wild birds circulating in markets where live poultry and other mammalian hosts can be found may represent an interface for avian influenza transmission, mutation, and re-assortment of domestic and wild viruses (Moon et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2005) . The very high volume of monitor lizard and wild boar meat sold on markets may increase the risk of food-borne parasite transmission, such as Taenia solium, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, Trichinella spp., and Hepatitis E virus, all transmitted through consumption of insufficiently cooked meat and present in Laos (Barennes et al., 2008; Holt et al., 2016; Ming et al., 2017) .

Almost sixty percent of the pathogens that have emerged in humans during the last 30-40 years are of animal origin and about sixty percent of them show an important variety of host species besides humans (3 or more possible host species). In this review, we focus on zoonotic infections with vector-borne transmission and dissect the contrasting effects that a multiplicity of host reservoirs and vectors can have on their disease dynamics. We discuss the effects exerted by host and vector species richness and composition on pathogen prevalence (i.e., reduction, including the dilution effect, or amplification). We emphasize that, in multiple host systems and for vector-borne zoonotic pathogens, host reservoir species and vector species can exert contrasting effect locally. The outcome on disease dynamics (reduced pathogen prevalence in vectors when the host reservoir species is rich and increased pathogen prevalence when the vector species richness increases) may be highly heterogeneous in both space and time. We then ask briefly how a shift towards a more systemic perspective in the study of emerging infectious diseases, which are driven by a multiplicity of hosts, may stimulate further research developments. Finally, we propose some research avenues that take better into account the multi-host species reality in the transmission of the most important emerging infectious diseases, and, particularly, suggest, as a possible orientation, the careful assessment of the life-history characteristics of hosts and vectors in a community ecology-based perspective. ß 2011 Acadé mie des sciences.

Understanding how they are transmitted in animal species communities and identifying the underlying ecological and evolutionary mechanisms is essential to lessen the transmission risk to humans [7] . Anthropogenic changes in landscapes, particularly habitat destruction and fragmentation [4] and their subsequent effects on biological diversity have led to disease emergence in a number of situations [8] . Here, we discuss new insights gained from studies that explicitly acknowledge the contribution of multi-host species systems to the dynamics of emerging pathogens. Throughout this review, we also argue on the necessity to better cross-fertilize the two separate research fields of epidemiology and ecology of infectious diseases if we want to anticipate future epidemics.

Further, the observation that sick birds died and one of these few animals had H5N1 raises the question as to whether the migratory birds in this surveillance project were highly competent carriers of the organism. Further work must be performed to determine if there is a species of wild bird that can carry the disease for long distances. If wild birds prove to die precipitously from the disease, then wildlife birds are not likely the source of spread for HPAI H5N1, but rather one must consider other sources for spread into domestic poultry populations. These sources could easily be domestic poultry or the vast number of animals moving through the trade in domestic animals and wildlife for meat and pets that are being placed into markets in distant and disparate sites. The most effective method of protecting people from contracting HPAI H5N1 is to educate them on proper sanitation and hygiene for themselves and their domestic poultry. Basic preventive methods such as hand washing and proper protective garb when handling poultry will greatly reduce the risk of spread to humans from animals.

In cases in which the virus establishes long-term endemicity in intermediate hosts, intermediate hosts can become natural hosts according to the above definition. The viruses existing in the primordial host and the intermediate host can both belong to the same species, but the viral source population involved in zoonotic transmission may be disconnected from that in the primordial host. For clarity of source implications, we will therefore refer to source species in zoonotic transmission processes as zoonotic sources, irrespective of whether they also fulfill all criteria of natural hosts. A prominent example is rabies virus that has highly diversified conspecifics in bats but is enzootic in dogs to such a degree that dogs are considered zoonotic sources and natural hosts at the same time, but not primordial hosts. The transmission of Nipah and Hendra virus (belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae) from bats to humans involves swine or horses that act as zoonotic sources but are not considered natural hosts because they are only accidentally infected (Eaton et al., 2006) . Intermediate hosts may act as zoonotic sources for dead-end hosts not only because they close gaps of contact between species, but also because they could make the virus transmissible by intermediary adaptation (Caron et al., 2015; Plowright et al., 2015) . Intermediary adaptation was strongly suspected for the SARS-CoV whose zoonotic source is in carnivores, in which the virus would have evolved human-compatible receptor tropism Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2004) . However, viruses directly infecting human cells have later been found in rhinolophid bats, the primordial natural host of the species SARS-related CoV Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015) . Of note, these viruses are conspecific with SARS-CoV but do not fall into the viral clade that was transferred from carnivores to humans and initiated the epidemic. The actual ancestors of the SARS-CoV may continue to exist in the natural reservoir, as new virus variants are continuously formed in the reservoir. If the natural host (e.g., a bat species) harbors different virus populations of the same species, recombination contributes new variants. The proofreading and repair mechanisms typical in CoVs may aid the survival and selection of recombinant viruses in populations (Eckerle et al., 2010; Hanada et al., 2004; Minskaia et al., 2006) . Indeed, recombination between the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike gene has been discussed as one of the major mechanism involved in the emergence of human SARS-CoV strains from bat and civet ancestors (Eckerle et al., 2010) . On the other hand, ongoing recombination maintains stability of the gene pool of a defined virus species by shuffling sequences and thus limiting divergence processes (Lukashev, 2010) .",44.259505965943305,18.34617171140741

It might also be desirable to monitor farm animals and pet cats for infection with 2019-nCoV, since their ACE2 receptor responsible for 2019-nCoV binding differs in only a few amino acids from human ACE2. Surveillance might prevent the virus establishing itself in another animal species that is in close contact to humans. In addition, in light of the fact that there are multiple species of CoVs circulating in wildlife species and that these animals are constantly interacting with each other, host-species expansion or interspecies transmission of new CoV to humans seems to be inevitable. Major knowledge gaps regarding the emergence of 2019-nCoV remain exists but worldwide scientists are working with unprecedented speed to investigate the virus, rushing to develop targeted therapeutics (see Outstanding Questions). Notwithstanding, a global surveillance network involving veterinarians and animal biologists is urgently needed to monitor, and possibly to predict, potential sources for the emergence of another highly pathogenic CoV.

Ecological, social, or socioeconomic changes (eg, change in land use) alter the dynamics of pathogen transmission within the host or between hosts and allow the pathogen to expand within its host population, spread to a new region, or be transmitted to another non-human host population or species. Each of these changes increases the likelihood of the pathogen making contact with and spilling over into human beings (and thus progressing to stage 2). 1, 6, 7 The drivers that cause stage 1 emergence tend to be large-scale environmental, agricultural, or demographic shifts-eg, moving of livestock to a region for the fi rst time, or transportation of wildlife from a region for food. Such events happened before the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1997, after intensively managed pig farms and fruit orchards were built in a region frequented by fruit bats (the natural reservoir). These bats began to feed on fruit trees around pigsties, enabling viral transmission to pigs and stage 1 emergence. 14 Similarly, change in land use in Africa has brought livestock, people, and wildlife into the same habitat, leading to multidirectional pathogen transmission between livestock and non-human primates (stage 1), and some spillover into people (stage 2). 15 Stage 2 (localised emergence): initial spillover of a wildlife or livestock pathogen to people. Causes range from handling of butchered wildlife to exposure to fomites in wildlife markets or livestock farms, or in the wild.

Targeting of surveillance to such regions pro vides a rationale for better allocation of global resources to prevent emerging infectious disease or rapidly deal with outbreaks. 3 The process through which pandemic zoonoses emerge can be analysed to identify the crucial control points and specifi c research challenges (panel 1, fi gure 2). The model we adopt here (developed by Daszak) to assess pandemic potential has three stagesno human infection (stage 1), localised human infection (spillover; stage 2), and widespread transmission and global dissemination (stage 3). The frequency at which stages 1 and 2 occur is unknown but probably high. That human populations are continually exposed to a wide variety of non-human-animal pathogens, many of which infect human beings, seems reasonable to assume. To assess the role of pathogen biology in emergence, investigators need to know how many pathogens people are exposed to and how many successfully cross the species barrier. A complete inventory of spillovers is not available, but researchers have a good working know ledge of pathogens of domestic livestock and pets (species in frequent contact with human beings). Almost 50% of the roughly 1000 species of pathogens that are noted in livestock and pets are zoonotic, 17 implying that any barriers between these hosts and human beings are routinely breached by many diff erent pathogens. More than 50% of the recognised pathogens of human beings can infect other vertebrate hosts. 18 Many non-human pathogens can infect several hosts, and clear examples of viruses transferring between diff erent animal hosts to cause outbreaks in other species have been reported. 17, 19 Pathogens can transfer from human beings to animals and between diff erent animal species before being trans ferred back to people, allowing remixing and evolution with spill-back and potentially enhanced pathogenicity (eg, infl uenza). 20, 21 Human pathogens from all taxa contain zoonotic species. Roughly 80% of viruses, 50% of bacteria, 40% of fungi, 70% of protozoa, and 95% of helminths that infect human beings are zoonotic. 18 Most of the identifi ed reservoirs are mammalian (roughly 80%) or, to a lesser extent, avian, 18, 22 although people share some pathogens with invertebrates, which act as vectors 23 or inter mediate hosts. Identifi cation of the key taxonomic groups that are sources for the emergence of zoonotic disease could help to improve targeting of surveillance and interventions. Ungulates are the mammalian taxa with which human beings share the most pathogens 17 -perhaps not surprising because, as major food sources, these animals are often in close proximity to people, and their diseases have been studied extensively. Rodents, carnivores, and primates are also well represented. Although pathogens deemed emerging or re-emerging are disproportionately likely to be zoonotic, 18 their reservoirs are much the same as those of non-emerging zoonoses. 22 The situation, however, is substantially diff erent for pathogens that have reached stage 3. A disproportionate number of these pathogens are viruses, suggesting that viruses have the potential to evolve more rapidly than do other kinds of pathogen. However, this fi nding could be due to ascertainment bias. Less complete knowledge is available about the diversity of viruses than that of other pathogens, and researchers might still be missing many at stages 1 and 2. 24 Although a lot of stage 3 pathogens that infect only people don't strictly have reservoirs (eg, HIV-1), many are thought to have had zoonotic origins, including in non-human primates, which con trasts strongly with the minor contribution of primates as High risk Moderate risk Low risk Figure 1 : Global hotspots for emerging infectious diseases that originate in wildlife A database of all known emerging infectious diseases 3 since 1940 was used to identify the most likely origins of each separate emergence event. Presence or absence of infections emerging from wildlife was analysed with logistic regression against a series of known drivers, including human population density, change in human population density, and wildlife diversity (mammalian species richness), gridded at 1 km² resolution. The global distribution of model outputs gives a measure of the likelihood of a region to generate a new zoonotic emerging infectious disease that originates in wildlife. Because previous pandemics have mainly originated in wildlife, these maps identify hotspots where the next pandemic is most likely to originate. reservoirs for zoo noses in general. If risk is a function of contact frequency and probability of successful adaptation to human beings, pathogens acquired from other primates might already be better adapted to successful transmission than those from other mammals (exposure from rodents, bats, 25 and other common vertebrates are the most frequent).",44.58884674259289,18.309409656940822

Taylor and colleagues observed that out of 1415 species of infectious organisms that have been identified to be pathogenic to human beings, 61% are zoonotic pathogens. Emerging infectious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Symptoms (SARS), avian influenza, West Nile and HIV/AIDS, Nipah virus, Ebola, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are all associated with zoonotic pathogens. In general, zoonotic diseases are usually severe, with high fatality rates, and have no readily available cure, treatment or vaccine. Because zoonotic pathogens complete part of their natural life cycle in animal hosts, any human-induced activity that disturbs the equilibrium of wildlife habitats, such as encroachment into forested areas, is likely to facilitate the transmission of zoonotic pathogens between humans, wildlife, domestic animals, and plants (Daszak et al. 2001) .",41.94284891641758,15.976254506357687

Climate change will affect northern ecosystems by altering host range (i.e., expansions, shifts, increased or decreased overlap), abundance, and resilience, in addition to availability of environmental contaminants, free-living stages of pathogens, and intermediate hosts/vectors (Table 2) . Climate change may also interact with other drivers for infectious disease emergence in northern North America. These include 1) development of new ecotones related to expansion of southern animal species, such as deer, red fox, and domestic livestock; 2) altered routes and timing of migration for wild birds and caribou herds; 3) habitat alteration and fragmentation due to resource extraction and development; and 4) historical and ongoing translocation of hosts and pathogens (e.g., historical introductions of reindeer and muskoxen, natural expansion of existing wood bison populations, proposed reestablishment of wood bison in Alaska, and increasing interest in livestock production in the North). The cumulative implications for health of wildlife that are culturally and economically important for northern communities are unlikely to be positive (37) .

Specific questions that could be asked include whether filoviruses infect and replicate in reservoir host APCs in vivo, whether they elicit different responses in reservoir host APCs as compared to human APCs and whether the potency of innate immune evasion mechanisms differs in reservoir hosts as compared with primate cells.

The practical challenges range from establishing appropriate data collection to managing increasingly large volumes of information. The theoretical challenges require fundamental study of many-layered, non-linear systems in which infections evolve and spread and where key events can be governed by unpredictable pathogen biology or human behavior. In this Review, we start with an examination of real-time outbreak response using the West African Ebola epidemic as an example. Here, the challenges range from underreporting of cases and deaths, and missing information on the impact of control measures to understanding human responses. The possibility of future zoonoses tests our ability to detect anomalous outbreaks and to estimate human-to-human transmissibility against a backdrop of ongoing zoonotic spillover while also assessing the risk of more dangerous strains evolving. Increased understanding of the dynamics of infections in food webs and ecosystems where host and nonhost species interact is key. Simultaneous multispecies infections are increasingly recognized as a notable public health burden, yet our understanding of how different species of pathogens interact within hosts is rudimentary. Pathogen genomics has become an essential tool for drawing inferences about evolution and transmission and, here but also in general, heterogeneity is the major challenge. Methods that depart from simplistic assumptions about random mixing are yielding new insights into the dynamics of transmission and control. There is rapid growth in estimation of model parameters from mismatched or incomplete data, and in contrasting model output with realworld observations. New data streams on social connectivity and behavior are being used, and combining data collected from very different sources and scales presents important challenges.",38.33510923435585,15.378950888093348

Leading into the International Polar","A broader understanding of the drivers for infectious disease emergence is in part dependent on appreciating why pathogens occur in particular regional settings and host groups, which is in turn determined by evolutionary and ecologic constraints that have structured pathogen diversity in space and time (11,22,23; Table 2 ). Our interpretations of current host and geographic distributions of northern parasites have been guided by a strong foundation in historical processes, both recent and deep (10 thousand years before present [KYBP] to 5 million years before present [MYBP]) (9, 18, 22) . For example, the current focal distribution of the Arctic-adapted lungworm U. pallikuukensis in a circumscribed population of muskoxen ( Figure 2 ) is attributed to recent host extirpation and reduction to a remnant population in the early 1900s, primarily as a result of hunting (12, 14) . In contrast, deeper historical processes (600-300 KYBP) account for widespread distribution of the lungworm P. stilesi in wild sheep, which entered North America across Beringia, the land mass that historically joined North America and Siberia (10, 24) . The muscleworm P. odocoilei has a more heterogeneous distribution in wild sheep because these hosts were colonized relatively recently (late Pleistocene) in a host-switching event from deer (Odocoileus hemionus), probably when the 2 species were concentrated in glacial refugia, and later expanded northwards following deglaciation (categories of emergence: host switching and geographic expansion) (15,24; I. Asmundsson, E.P. Hoberg, E.J. Jenkins, unpub. data). Table 1 .

For example, knowledge of the relationship and behavior of related parasites provided immediate information on the likely life history of U. pallikuukensis (12, 14) and site specifi city and potential hosts for P. odocoilei (17) and is now guiding our search for adults of a previously undescribed protostrongylid (20) . Finally, we have a unique window into the past to examine historical diversity and phylogeny as pathogens in frozen feces of caribou and other northern wildlife species (both extant and extinct) emerge from receding ice packs-a natural cryoarchive.

To identify the wildlife species that harbor the greatest proportion of potential novel zoonoses, we need to consider two factors: phylogeny and contact. Logically, it is more likely that a virus harbored by a wildlife species phylogenetically closely related to humans will be able to replicate in human cells following exposure. However, testing this hypothesis has not been the focus of a great deal of research effort, other than studies in plants [7] , bats [8] , and insects [9] . With large databases of virus-host relationships, global datasets on wildlife host traits and viral phylogeny, extending these studies to produce predictive models should be plausible.

Some prevailing sociocultural practices, such as an increasing encroachment of human activities in the forests or the close contact between human and livestock populations, especially in poor and marginalised populations, provide excellent conditions for the frequent exchange of pathogens between animal and human populations. Furthermore, the high human and animal density and the globalisation of trade facilitate the spread of the diseases.

In the absence of these analyses, decisions on which wildlife species to target for sample collection, and which human populations to conduct surveillance on are made based on assumptions about typical emerging diseases. For example, there is a great deal of interest in bush meat hunters because it is logical that their exposure to wildlife is intimate. A more targeted approach would be to estimate the intensity of exposure, the frequency of exposure and the species that different groups make contact with in EID hotspots. For example, if a hunter only catches one primate a week, is that person at higher risk of viral spillover than someone who lives on the forest edge and gets regular exposure to primate or rodent fomites and feces? Efforts to effectively target the first case clusters of a newly emerging pathogen could involve surveillance of other high-risk communities such as forest workers, road builders, miners, livestock production workers, abattoir workers, field hands and others. However, analyses of the relative risk of exposure in each of these populations are critical to better inform surveillance, and give the most effective use of resources.

In work presented by the International Labor Organization, it is estimated that between 1.9-2.3 million work-related deaths occurred worldwide in 2000 (data available at www.ilo.org/safework). In the same work, the lower limit of work-related diseases was 1.6 million and approximately 320,000 (20%) were attributed to communicable diseases (data available at www.ilo.org/safework). The epidemiology appears to differ per country and depends on gross domestic product (GDP) per sector. The type of profession is also very important. The healthcare professions are characteristically associated with an occupational risk from blood-borne pathogens that has led to the implementation of specific protection measures (Beekmann & Henderson 2005; Brunetti et al. 2006; Puro et al. 2005; Sadoh, Fawole, Sadoh, Oladimeji & Sotiloye 2006) . A large study from the Netherlands examining data from a region with a half-million people (and two major hospitals) discovered an incidence of exposure to blood-borne pathogens of 1.2 cases per day-both in the hospital and the community setting (van Wijk et al. 2006) . Athough the incidents were split between the hospital and the community setting, they were related to occupational activities 95 percent of the time and, more specifically, healthcare activities in 84 percent of the cases (van Wijk et al. 2006) . High-risk incidents predominantly involved hospital personnel (van Wijk et al. 2006 ). In another large study from the United Kingdom, known hepatitis C virus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmissions to health care workers was reported to be at the rate of 1.43 per year. In the same study, HIV and hepatitis C transmissions were occurring at an approximate rate of 0.009 per 1,000 hospital beds per year. The risk of infection when exposure involved sources with no risk factors was significantly lower (less than one in one million for HIV transmission). More work is necessary to correctly identify prevalence and incidence of specific disease entities according to profession, and recent studies have shown unexpected observations (Olsen, Axelsson-Olsson, Thelin & Weiland 2006) .

Furthermore, the observation that SL-CoVs from R. sinicus are prone to recombine with CoVs from other hosts may suggest that the wildlife markets in Guangdong may provide an ideal incubator for the genesis of SARS-CoVs. Moreover, human consumption of wildlife increases the possibility of human exposure to viruses carried by wildlife.

When disease outbreaks occur in people, the animal source is often diffi cult to identify, restricting epidemiological investigation and ecological understanding. As for many zoonoses, foodborne pathogens often cause mild or subclinical disease in reservoir hosts, and because surveillance systems for wildlife and domestic animals are not universally adequate for detection of clinical disease or pathogen presence, humans beings often act as sentinel populations for zoonoses. 39 The volume of consumption of wildlife products for food is at least an order of magnitude lower than it is for domestic livestock. 40 However, human being-animal contact associated with hunting, preparation, and consumption of wild animals has led to transmission of notable diseases. Such diseases include HIV/AIDS, which was linked to the butchering of hunted chimpanzees, 41 SARS, which emerged in wildlife market and restaurant workers in southern China, 42 and Ebola haemorrhagic fever linked to the hunting or handling of infected great apes or other wild animals. 43 All these disease transmissions are examples of organ isms or pathogens exploiting new host opportunities resulting from human behaviour.

Livestock may act as a secondary host which facilitates transmission to humans. Vectors, such as mosquitoes or midges, may also be involved. Many spillover events do not result in sustained disease transmission: the infection is not well adapted to the new host and burns out. However, in some cases, the disease establishes in a new host. Emerging zoonotic diseases have obvious implications for nutritional and food security. Widespread animal diseases reduce the availability of animal source food. But control of ZEIDs can also reduce animal source food available with likely nutritional consequences (Kavle et al., 2015) . If people become ill their health and nutrition are obviously affected.

Land modifi cation, irrespective of reason, changes vegetation patterns, vector and host species dynamics (eg, abundance, distri bution, and demographics), microclimates, and human contact with domestic and wild animals. All these factors are crucial in disease ecology. The eff ects have been well studied and described for vector-borne diseases such as malaria and Lyme disease. 48 In northeastern USA, a historical cycle of deforestation, reforestation, and habitat fragmentation changed predator-prey popu lations and led to the emergence of Lyme disease. 24 Prevalence of human alveolar echinococcosis (caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, a tapeworm of wild and domestic canids, with small mammals serving as inter mediate hosts) in Tibet is correlated with overgrazing and degradation of pastures and the resulting increase in small mammal densities. 49 In tropical regions, changes in land use have been linked to the occurrence of Chagas disease, 50 yellow fever, 51 and leishmaniasis. 51 Such changes are particularly intense in tropical regions where primary forest is opened up to mining, logging, plantation devel opment, and oil and gas extraction. This deforestation poses a threat to global health because many of these regions are emerging disease hotspots-rich in wildlife biodiversity and probably rich in the diversity of microbes, many of which have not yet been encountered by people. 8 Increased access to tropical forests for these extractive industries might increase the risk of zoonotic disease by changing habitat and vector community com position, modifying the distribution of wildlife popu lations and domestic animals, and increasing exposure to pathogens through increased human contact with animals. 48, 50 Human contact with wildlife is increased on a large scale through road building, establishment of settlements, and increased mobility of people, and the extractive process itself. 51 Where these changes take place, hunting, consumption, and trade in wildlife for food often increases. 4, 52 If sites are poorly managed, increased populations can strain existing infrastructure, leading to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, improper disposal of waste, and a lack of potable water. 53 All of these changes increase the risk of cross-species trans mission of pathogens, resulting in zoonotic disease.

A decrease in the abundance of a preferred animal host can cause an arthropod vector to shift feeding patterns to human beings, leading to a disease outbreak. For example, when rinderpest was fi rst introduced to east Africa, cattle and wildebeest populations depleted rapidly and tsetse fl ies switched to feeding on people, causing a large epidemic of sleeping sickness. 27 Environmental changes (including anthropogenic eff ects) might change the abundance of a wildlife reservoir host, increasing transmission within the reservoir and the risk of zoonotic transmission. El Niño events in 1991-92 and 1997-98 led to human hantavirus cases in the southwestern USA via an ecological cascade: increased precipitation caused vege tation growth, allow ing rodent densities to rise, allowing an increase in hantavirus infections in rodents. This increase did not cause population declines in rodents because, like many wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic patho gens, hantavirus causes mild or subclinical infections in this group. However, the increased prevalence in rodents increased the risk of infection in people. 28 Ecological principles also apply at the scale of individuals. Infected hosts contain a population of patho gens that grows and evolves according to the same principles as a free-living plant or animal popu lation. Processes of viral replication, immune clearance, and tissue tropism can be understood by analogy to ecological processes of reproduction, mortality, and dispersal between habitats. 29, 30 The microbial ecology of zoonotic pathogens within their reservoir hosts can be a key determinant of risk to human health. For example, feeding diff erent diets to beef cattle before slaughter leads to diff erent environmental conditions within the gut, and a shift in the balance of competition among microbial species, which can change the abundance of human pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7. 31 The ecological principle of competitive exclusion is the basis for common approaches to control of zoonotic pathogens in livestock and poultry. 32, 33 Meta-genomic studies show that the community of commensal bacteria within healthy hosts plays an important part in defence against pathogens. 34 Furthermore, disruption of this community through changes in diet or use of antimicrobials can allow the growth of other organisms, some of which might be pathogenic. This mechanism underlies diff erential susceptibility to Clostridium diffi cile infection and might also increase the risk of zoonotic infections (as reported for salmonella). 35, 36 This factor underscores the importance of study of the full microbial community within hosts (microbiome), and not just pathogens. 34",35.434033001746656,14.263106196969819

The outbreak of monkeypox virus in humans in the USA in 2003 was the result of the importation of infected African rodents, including rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.), Gambian giant rats (Cricetomys spp.), and African dormice (Graphiurus spp.), which subsequently infected prairie dogs in quarantine. In total, 81 human cases of monkeypox were diagnosed (Di Giulio and Eckburg 2004) . On a broader scale, the legal and illegal trade of wildlife and wildlife products represents a major source of emerging infectious diseases, from local scales, involving bushmeat hunting and wet markets, to cross-continental scales. It expands the diversity of animal species coming into contact with humans and their domestic animals. These diseases may affect humans, their domestic animals, or other wild animal species, thus also expanding the dire consequences of their cross-species transmission across the contemporary human-animal interface. Although the animal reservoirs of Filoviruses like Ebola virus are unknown, bush-meat hunting in Africa, in particular of primate species, is typically incriminated as the source of recent violent outbreaks in humans (Wolfe et al. 2005) . As growing human populations in urban areas feed the demand for bush-meat, intensive hunting and trade are likely to pose an increasing risk for the cross-species transmission of these and other pathogens in African countries. Wet markets in Asia, hosting a diversity of wild animal species, were the sources of the novel coronavirus that triggered the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in (Peiris et al. 2003 . As for Ebola viruses, the animal reservoirs of the virus were unknown at the time of its emergence in humans. Civet cats found infected with the virus at the wet markets were the stepping stones in the chain of transmission of this new pathogen to humans (Song et al. 2005) . For both filoviruses and the SARS coronavirus, bat species are now considered the most likely reservoir hosts (Li et al. 2005; Monath 1999 ). These two examples illustrate the complex cross-species transmission dynamics at the human-wild-animal interface that arise from the intensifying trade of wildlife and their products. Among the most spectacular examples of global spread of a wildlife disease is that of the emerging chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, affecting and threatening amphibian populations worldwide. Its emergence is thought to have followed the international trade of an African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, starting in the 1930s (Weldon et al. 2004 ). The pathogen is now found on every continent that has amphibians, and is likely the cause of the dramatic amphibian population declines and extinctions recently witnessed in many parts of the world. The trading component of the contemporary human-animal interface has undoubtedly taken domestication and the exploitation of animal species to levels beyond the imaginable, realizing unparalleled meltingpot conditions for the emergence of new human and animal pathogens.",35.6670192037337,13.80129001677131

Destruction of natural habitat for agricultural purposes has been associated with rodent colonization and population expansion that favored the cross-species transmission of these novel pathogens to the human species. Arena-and hantaviruses have co-evolved with their rodent hosts: they cause asymptomatic chronic infections in these hosts, and their phylogeny closely mimics that of their hosts, in a similar way to that of the heirloom pathogens of humans. Cross-species transmission of these viruses typically may turn them from harmless to life-threatening pathogens for both humans and domestic animals. While New World arenaviruses (such as Junin, Machupo, and Guanarito viruses) cause hemorrhagic fever syndromes in humans, New World hantaviruses (such as Sin Nombre, Oropouche, and Andes viruses) cause acute pulmonary syndromes.

In general, increasing opportunities for human exposure to animal groups with high zoonotic potential will increase the risk of zoonotic disease in humans. In addition to overall host richness of an area, zoonotic potential depends on the chance that a species is a zoonotic host given the order it belongs to, and breadth of zoonoses harbored by host species in a given order [13] . Thus, based on the results described above, rodents can be considered to have high zoonotic potential because there are more rodent host species than hosts from any other mammal group. And while there are fewer carnivoran species in comparison to rodents, they may also be considered to have high zoonotic potential because a greater fraction of them are zoonotic hosts (i.e., given an encounter with a carnivore, the likelihood that it is a zoonotic host is higher than for an equivalent encounter with a rodent from which there are comparatively fewer zoonotic hosts). If the high degree of parasite sharing suggests that the majority of zoonoses has already been transmitted from wild reservoirs to humans, the fact that humans already share a large number of zoonoses with carnivorans may indicate there are few zoonoses left to spillover anew (novel emergence) but many available to seed re-emergence events. Carnivorans also carry a greater diversity of zoonotic pathogens than any other mammal group. While zoonotic potential is considered high for rodents based purely on numerical frequency, there may be something intrinsic about carnivores where, despite relatively low direct contact with humans, they are more permissive to zoonotic infections and may be particularly good at sustaining them even if the risk of transmissible contacts with humans is lower. Similarly, while there are fewer species of ungulates compared to rodents, bats, primates, carnivorans, and insectivorans ( Figure 2 , Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla), many more wild ungulates are closely related to domesticated livestock species that humans are in regular and increasingly close contact, which could facilitate successful transmission [13 , 20 , 67 , 71] . Bats are suspected to be particularly permissive hosts of zoonotic infection [72 , 73] , but outside of the paleotropics where bats are hunted as bushmeat, direct human contact with bats is likely surpassed by contact with rodents. Thus, for both bats and carnivorans, it may be more likely that spillover is facilitated by indirect transmission (e.g., for bats, contact with partially consumed food, including insects, vertebrates, and fruit; [12 , 74] ; for carnivorans, contact with domesticated pets or livestock, and through parasite shedding in encroaching habitats [75] ). These patterns should also be tempered by more explicit quantification of surveillance bias. For example, the surveillance scrutiny applied to bats for particular pathogen types (e.g., viruses [76 , 77] ), may skew the number of species found to be positive for zoonotic viruses. Similar surveillance biases across other clades will impede comparisons of relative zoonotic disease risk posed by particular mammal groups or species.",54.052218136153186,19.930556740300403

Ultimately, there are many factors describing hosts, pathogens, and environments that combine to determine the risk of zoonotic disease emergence from mammal species. Understanding the current geographic and taxonomic distributions of zoonotic mammalian hosts offers an important baseline of empirical data against which observed patterns of human disease can be compared to improve first-order predictions of human disease risk posed by wild mammals. Here, we have summarized the global distributions of mammal hosts and the zoonoses they carry, and discuss them in context of existing research on human zoonoses. These hotspots provide only a partial view of zoonotic disease risk in humans and highlight many outstanding questions for future research (see Outstanding Questions). Moving forward, studies comparing hotspots of mammal hosts or particular pathogen types against the spatial landscape of epidemiological metrics (e.g., prevalence, incidence, frequency of disease events in human populations) and extrinsic drivers (e.g., environmental, sociopolitical, economic) will continue to triangulate those areas where high realized risk of human disease coincides with high zoonotic potential.

In enzootic cycles, vertebrates, including birds, primates and small mammals, serve as amplifying hosts by producing viremias (Figure 2 ). After ingestion from a viremic vertebrate host, the virus infects midgut epithelial cells and then disseminates to secondary sites of infection in the open body cavity (hemocoel) of the vector. Subsequent virus replication in salivary glands and deposition into saliva allows for transmission during subsequent feeding.

Understanding the ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments will become increasingly important for managing disease risks to wildlife and, in some cases, humans. Indeed, many pathogens are capable of infecting multiple host species [11, 12] , and some pose serious threats to human health and already vulnerable wildlife populations [13] .

Consumer demand for local and organic production systems actually increases the greenhouse gas footprint of most developed and many developing country food systems, depending on the crop or animal product [8] [9] [10] and also can increase food safety risks relative to today's widely used production systems. 11 Those producers that remain local are often small in size, thus limiting benefits of scale, and many use organic methods, which can limit their ability to prevent disease through approaches such as constructing barriers and facilities for containment. The result is increased contact with wildlife, which increases opportunities for the transmission of infectious diseases to crops, livestock, and humans. For instance, interaction between domestic poultry and wild waterfowl reservoirs has resulted in the introduction of new IAV, 12 and the movement of H5 HPAI from domestic poultry to free-flying bird populations demonstrates that the exchange can be bidirectional, 13 which changes paradigms of transboundary disease spread. The interface between wildlife and agriculture will only increase as more land is converted for agricultural use to meet consumer demands, thus forcing wildlife into shrinking habitats or to adapt to increased contact with humans and livestock. Housing food animals inside helps to protect animal health, prevent cross-species disease transmission, and improve production efficiency, but it does not always meet consumer preference for local needs and resources. Nontherapeutic (nonclinical) antibiotic use in food animals is a tool that promotes production efficiency, but it has been associated with a rise in antibiotic resistance of human pathogens. However, epidemiological and ecological studies fail to support a causal link; instead, these studies indicate the spread of antibiotic resistance from humans to pigs and chickens. 14 In the future, the World Food Summit global food strategy of ""providing access for all people at all times to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life"" must be expanded to include considerations for environmental sustainability, animal welfare and non-nutritional aspects of public health. 15 Progress toward these goals requires strong linkage of scientific knowledge and discovery that helps both to advance medical practice and health improvement as well as inform health policy development.",39.14117619507881,15.875938924051129

This is not unexpected given that they constitute 20% of known mammalian species, have unique and diverse lifestyles including the ability to fly, they often have gregarious social structures achieving incredible abundance and densities, some cave-dwelling bats reaching up to 500 individuals per square foot, and they have long life spans. Importantly they also frequently live in very close proximity to humans, often interact closely with livestock and other domestic animals that are potential intermediate hosts for human pathogens, and with habitat loss due to land changes, are therefore very much at the wildlife-human interface [16] . Bats are grouped into two suborders, Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera; the former comprises a single family, Pteropididae, containing 42 genera and 166 species of fruit bats and flying foxes which do not use echolocation; and the latter comprises 18 families of 135 genera and 917 species, most of which use echolocation. Thus bats provide a rich and diverse source of potential reservoirs. Prior to SARS, Pteropid fruit bats had been found to be the reservoirs of a number of novel viruses able to infect humans, including two new paramyxoviruses, Hendra [17, 18] . This latter virus, which is closely related to classical rabies virus, was also found in at least one species of insectivorous bat [24,25], but has not crossed into terrestrial wildlife or domestic animal hosts. Thus, it is clear that RNA viruses associated with Old World fruit bats pose zoonotic disease threats of high public health significance. Insectivorous bats have also been strong candidates as potential reservoirs, as demonstrated by their role as reservoirs of rabies and rabies-like Lyssaviruses in Europe, Africa and elsewhere in the Old World, and in the Americas. It was therefore not surprising that bats were the major initial target in the search for the natural reservoirs of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).",56.74476360731842,20.70220490355027

Our hypothesis states that an individual might reach a subthreshold for PTSD and then develop the illness due to a decreased availability of resources, an accumulation of risk factors such as personality traits or poor social interactions, or a major stressful life event. Furthermore, unresolved subclinical psychiatric symptoms caused by a disaster may increase a survivor's sensitivity to future stressors. 7 ",34.041542690626045,13.125590851476728

The toll in illness and death from emerging zoonotic diseases is high, and outbreak investigations are costly (37) . These investigations often fail to identify the source of a pathogen, let alone answer the question of why an outbreak occurred at a given time and place. If the host species or vector is found, eradication usually is neither possible nor desirable, particularly when the species are as ubiquitous as deer mice. Prophylaxis is difficult when transmission is airborne, as in hantaviruses, for which potentially everyone in a region is at risk. Ecosystem-level control may be the best way to protect the public from the increasing threat of many zoonotic diseases. Wildlife also are at risk for infection with novel pathogens, and the factors underlying wildlife disease emergence are similar to those in humans (38) ; a dilution effect may therefore help protect wildlife as well. For example, a study of West Nile virus suggested that increased bird species richness depressed the prevalence of the virus in ecosystems (39) . Thus, wildlife could be protected in 2 ways: first, from dilution of diseases that are potentially harmful to them and second, from maintenance of healthy ecosystems.",33.7395966320269,12.80300279301022

Some viruses are strictly species specific, while others have adapted themselves to many different hosts. Since viruses are generally unstable in the environment, transmission in the wild is usually limited to members within a herd, except when direct contact is made between animals of different species. The latter may be effected during fighting, by sharing water-holes, or by the consumption of virus-infected fluids and tissues by predators. However, many viruses have circumvented this limitation by making use of insect vectors, especially mosquitoes and ticks. There are more than 400 so-called 'arboviruses' (ARthropod BOrne viruses), representing several different virus families, which have adapted to growth in the cold blooded invertebrate host as well as many vertebrate species (McLean, 1980 In contrast, domesticated animals of different species are often deliberately maintained in close contact, thus permitting viruses more opportunity of cross-infection.

These factors can be extrinsic and/or intrinsic. Extrinsic factors such as environmental and anthropogenic stressors can have an effect on the ecology of disease in bats. Environmental stressors such as climatic events (typhoons/cyclones and droughts) that destroy habitat and food resources have been hypothesized to have an impact on the health of bats [40] [41] [42] [43] 44 ]. In addition, human activities are selecting for some species of bats that are synanthrophic, and so are benefiting from living close to humans, thereby increasing their numbers and the risk of transmission of disease to humans [45] . Human activities are artificially increasing animal densities by changing the land use and this is increasing the contact between humans, domesticated animals and bats [46] . In the cases of Hendra virus, Nipah virus and Menangle virus, domesticated animals are the amplifying hosts of these zoonotic viruses [15, 47, 48] . Habitat change such as deforestation force changes in roosting sites and can lead to alterations in the population density and the migratory patterns of bats. These anthropogenic activities may be impacting our ecosystem in such a way that the equilibrium is disturbed and spillover of zoonotic viruses readily occur [49] [50] [51] .",56.100690482811245,20.851681325897214

However, what are less obvious are the factors that modulate pathogenicity; such as exposure of naïve hosts being a major factor in the emergence of new diseases. This exposure can be as a result of changing environmental, ecological, behavioural and evolutionary conditions. Fine changes in the equilibrium of hosts and potential pathogens in their natural niches are resulting in the emergence of novel diseases in naïve populations. These changes are likely to accelerate in the future due to continuing pressures of global climate change, rapidly expanding human populations either due to housing or expansion of agriculture resulting in encroachment into previously unpopulated natural areas. In the future we are likely to see further emergence of novel pathogens and the increasing recognition of environmental microorganisms as potential pathogens due to human activities. Climate change may also allow pathogens to move into new environmental niches where they previously where not a concern. This will place an increasing demand on water and sewage treatment, the protection of crops from plant pathogens, and humans and other animals from newly emerging pathogens. The challenge for microbiologists and public health personnel is to identify and address these risks early for the protection of human and environmental health and agricultural crops (van Elsas et al. 2010) .

Habitat loss directly affects bat movement and pathogen spillover. For example, as humans have destroyed bat feeding habitats in subtropical Australia, pteropodid bats have sought alternative food sources in urban ar-eas, leading to spillover of Hendra virus from bats to horses, and subsequently humans (Plowright et al. 2015 ; Figure 6 ). A number of hypotheses link these urban bats to spillover: one hypothesis is that decreased movement of urban bats, and therefore decreased connectivity, leads to decreased population immunity and larger outbreaks of virus shedding; another hypothesis is that urban bats experience food shortages that lead to increased virus shedding (Plowright et al. 2011 (Plowright et al. , 2016 . Similarly, Nipah virus spillover has been linked to urban pteropodid bats drinking date palm sap from collection pots in Bangladesh, although the mechanisms linking bats and virus shedding are unknown (Luby et al. 2006) . Therefore, we conclude that linking bat movement ecology to disease ecology is critical to understand the role of bats as reservoir hosts, spillover risk, and the impact of disease on populations (De Castro and Bolker 2004; Wibbelt et al. 2010; Plowright et al. 2015) .",49.25037990161828,18.367892476441146

Evidence that a pathogen is permanently maintained in a population, often in the absence of disease, is required to confidently identify its reservoir (Calisher et al., 2006; Haydon et al., 2002) . Detection of fragments of viral genomes, combined with serological evidence for viral exposure in multiple individuals of a species are generally the first lines of evidence to associate a host with a pathogen (Halpin et al., 2011; Li et al., 2005; Swanepoel et al., 2007; Young et al., 1996) . Additional evidence in the form of virus isolation and the ability to link a reservoir to a spillover event is necessary to confirm the association. Examples of bat viruses that are confirmed or speculated to have 'jumped' from bats into humans and agricultural animals include coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] , porcine epidemic diarrhea [PEDV] virus), filoviruses (ebolaviruses and Marburg virus), and henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra viruses) [reviewed by (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015) ]. Consistent with the definition of a wildlife reservoir, infection of bats by some of these viruses results in viremia and viral shedding in the absence of clinical disease (Halpin et al., 2011; Schuh et al., 2017) . The spillover of some of these viruses to other susceptible hosts, including humans, can result in severe disease and mortality due to the lack of therapeutics and vaccines. The emergence of zoonotic diseases is increasing globally and mammals, including bats, are major sources of emerging and re-emerging pathogens (Plowright et al., 2015) . The drivers of disease emergence include anthropogenic changes to the environment (e.g., agricultural intensification), climate change and the encroachment of human populations into wildlife habitats (Tait et al., 2014) . The biological characterization of a newly identified virus often begins with its isolation in cultured cells. Although detection of virus-specific antibodies by serology and the use of molecular methods, such as viral sequencing, are often readily achievable, virus isolation from bats has been far more challenging. For example, bats are implicated as the reservoirs of ebolaviruses based on the detection of viral genome, serological evidence and their confirmed role as a reservoir for the closely related Marburg virus. However, ebolaviruses have yet to be isolated from bats to definitively link them to spillover events (Leroy et al., 2005) . Identifying wildlife reservoirs and the viruses they host will require the development of better laboratory tools for virus isolation to study replication kinetics and virus-host interactions.

These pathogens include rabies, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah and Hendra virus [1] [2] [3] [4] . To understand the conditions that enable pathogens to spill over from bats to other species, we need to understand the mechanisms driving pathogen dynamics within and among bat hosts. Pathogen spillover events are often associated with sharp increases, or pulses, in pathogen prevalence that vary in amplitude and timing [4] [5] [6] , but the mechanisms driving these pulses are unknown. Therefore, characterizing pulse variation across space and time, and identifying biotic and climatic factors associated with these pulses, will enhance our ability to predict and manage spillover [1, 7, 8] . Longitudinal studies across time and space are necessary to identify such factors [9, 10] , but such studies for wildlife zoonoses are rare.

The first is based on a philosophical belief that since cats are a domestic species, they should not be allowed to hunt wildlife but should be confined indoors, to an enclosure or yard or on a leash (arguably for the cats' welfare as well as for that of wildlife).The second theme is that cats are an introduced, non-native species and therefore should be removed from the environment. There are several assumptions underlying this argument: firstly, introduced or non-native species are harmful and native species should be protected from them. However, cattle and sheep are routinely protected from coyotes, foxes and wolves, despite the latter being native species that are killed because they may prey on domestic species (Cohen 1992) . In some locations, native mountain lions, northern harriers and kestrels have been killed to prevent them from preying on rare species (Cohen 1992) . The second assumption is that if we remove cats from the environment, the ecosystems will return to ""normal"" or to the pre-cat situation. However, ecosystems are complex and have often been heavily influenced by the effects of human habitation including construction, changes in fire control and water movement, pollution and the introduction of livestock. There are often other introduced plant and animal species (starlings or rats) that affect the balance of the ecosystem. For example, removing cats in certain locations may cause serious problems from the resulting increases in rodent populations. The third theme is the actual impact of cats on wildlife, largely through predation but also through competition or disease. While competition is commonly cited as a concern, little evidence is available to support this claim (George 1974) . Predation is generally considered to be the most serious problem, especially predation of birds. Again, the interaction between cats and wildlife varies widely from location to location, and is heavily influenced by other environmental factors such as variety of prey species, the reliance of cats on garbage or being fed, other pressures on local species, climate and the biology of threatened species.",33.93481427521555,14.642197248656222

Ideally, to control or predict the size and frequency of outbreaks, we should understand how pathogens persist in the cryptic phase, and we need to identify and predict conditions that cause outbreaks. Persistence and outbreaks can be affected by rates of transmission that are influenced by multiple factors, such as rainfall and temperature, host and vector abundance, exposure rates, and host behavior. But not all hosts are equal: Pathogens often display broad host ranges, infecting multiple host species that vary in predisposition to infectiousness, susceptibility to disease, and modes of transmission (e.g., direct contact, vector borne, and environmental exposure). Detection of the pathogen can be difficult if incidence becomes so low that ongoing surveillance efforts cannot detect outbreaks without an increase in sampling efforts.

This is clearly demonstrated with the recently emerged paramyxoviruses. To date, Hendra virus, isolated from the Australian species of pteropid bats, has been responsible for disease only in spillover hosts (horses) on the east coast of Australia. All human infections have occurred as a result of exposure to infected horses-thus, the limited geographic distribution of human disease. The Malaysian strain of Nipah virus, isolated from Malaysian species of pteropid bats, has caused disease only in spillover hosts (the major one being pigs) in that country, and, similarly, human infections occurred as a result of exposure to infected pigs.

For example, are fruit bats that are seropositive for Ebola virus evidence of heightened disease risk for human populations because fruit bats can be infectious and demonstrate local Ebola virus activity? Or are seropositive fruit bats simply indicative of recent Ebola virus transmission in an unidentified reservoir host some months prior? Without directly addressing these questions, precious public health resources may be misdirected into inappropriate monitoring and surveillance programs.

With rapid international transport, several infected travelers died after transit from West Africa to other parts of the word, which demonstrates the potential of a worldwide epidemic.

It can be described as a single infection ""spillover"" event, hence the very low number of cases. Were it not for the dreaded consequences of this disease, it would probably not attract medical attention. A major barrier against viral spillover between species is the species barrier. Unfortunately, this concept is more a time con fi rmed empirical medical concept than a much investigated experimentally phenomenon. What leads to breaches in this barrier? One could imagine that spillovers occur primarily between species with high ecological contact rates. Alternatively, the height of the barrier might be determined by host genetics factors. Streicker and colleagues ( 2010 ) have addressed this question by sequencing the nucleoprotein gene in nearly 400 rabies viruses isolated from 23 bat species. They identi fi ed 43 unambiguous cross-species infections. Their observations amount to one trans-species for every 73 within-species transmission events. These authors also observed that the intensity of the trans-species transmission declined continuously with the genetic difference between donor and recipient species. Transmission increased less with the extent of geographical overlap between species habitats. The authors concluded that the vast majority of the trans-species infections of bats with rabies virus are evolutionary dead-ends. From these data it appears that this highly mutable RNA virus does not represent a major concern for introduction of a bat virus into the human population. Can this relatively assuring conclusion be generalized to other viruses of bats? Unfortunately, the answer is No. In subsequent paragraphs, we will recognize cross-infections from bats that led to transient outbreaks (e.g. Nipah virus infections) and even sustained epidemics with the potential of endemic establishment (e.g. SARS corona virus) in the human population. There is another reason not to be complacent with bat rabies. Virologists from the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where Louis Pasteur had developed the fi rst rabies vaccine, had sequenced many lyssaviruses (how rabies virus is called taxonomically) isolated from carnivoran and chiropteran ("" fi nger-wings"", the systematical name of bats) hosts. The phylogenetic tree of the surface glycoprotein which is responsible for receptor recognition revealed seven genotypes (Badrane and Tordo 2001 ) . The long branches on the tree were all bat viruses. Genotype 1, the classical rabies group, was found in bats and carnivoran mammals. The carnivoran rabies viruses were all small twigs on the glycoprotein tree suggesting recent introduction. Using the tree, the authors deduced two spillover events, one into raccoons and another, independent event into the other carnivores (dog, fox, wolf, skunk, mongoose) which then spread worldwide without much diversi fi cation. Using molecular clock arguments, the authors dated this spillover to the time of the decline of the Roman Empire. They explained the fact that rabies was already described in cuneiform tablets in Mesopotamia 4,000 years ago by the hypothesis that this represented a spillover event with a rabies virus which became in the meanwhile extinct. In an even bolder hypothesis, the Pasteur authors speculated that bats had acquired the lyssaviruses from their insect prey.

In this respect, anthropogenic changes, and in particularly globalization, are drivers. Other changes including farming practice, environmental and climate change not only affect land use but also influence zoological and ecological factors including habitat and food supply. Thus, over time, there may be changes in both the range and distribution of species and intensity and nature of species' interactions. Climate change is associated with extreme weather events such as drought and flood. It is most likely to be linked to the geographical distribution of fruit bats through availability of food sources; the species P. nathusii has been observed to be adapting its range in response to recent climate changes [161, 162] . This raises the question of how the range and population of fruit bats will change; ultimately, warming could convert forests to grassland savannas which are unsuitable habitats. A shift in the range of pteropid bats due to climate change could have an impact on the circulation of henipaviruses, by putting bats under stress [163] . Pteropus spp. may excrete viruses more often than usual in stressful situations such as when their food is destroyed by climatic events and extreme stress can result in immune suppression which can facilitate increased shedding of the virus [100] . Bats may also spread the virus between regions if they search for food in areas unaffected by flooding. Additionally one study found a significant association with the dry season for spillover events [153] .",38.478483481480474,14.853025543834594

Human infection of NiV in particular is currently limited to Bangladesh and West Bengal in India. Given the more widespread identification of NiV amongst bat species and countries in Asia, it is not clear why human outbreaks appear to be confined to this region. This could reflect the route of transmission, sensitivity of surveillance and also perhaps the greater titre of NiV-Bangladesh in bat saliva or urine compared to NiV-Malaysia [33] . Further knowledge of why these viruses do not currently seem to be spreading further, could help in assessing the risk of further spread, including the risk of reaching the EU. While a number of studies report high serological prevalence, actual virus infection in bats is rarely detected. This could explain why human spillover events of NiV-Bangladesh are fairly localised. P. giganteus roosts have been identified within 5 km of villages in Bangladesh and can consist of around 650 individual bats [50] , so even a low prevalence of infection within the roost can mean that there are still sufficient numbers of infected individuals able to contaminate local food sources such as date palm sap.",35.831029923986655,14.082718264342288

Examples include the paramyxoviruses Nipah virus (NiV) in Malaysia and [2] and the filoviruses Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg viruses (MARV) in Africa [3] . Bats have also been linked with the more recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4, 5] . Nipah Virus, in particular, has been suggested to have pandemic potential as it is capable of limited human-human transmission and RNA viruses in general have particularly high mutation rates. A human-adapted strain of NiV, were it to emerge in Asia, could spread rapidly due to high population densities and global interconnectedness [1] . A large, and still increasing, number of different viruses have been isolated from bats, many of which are asymptomatic in the host and are closely related to human pathogens. These viruses have the potential for cross-species transmission (i.e., -spillover‖) to other mammalian species, for example, MARV in monkeys [6] and NiV in pigs [7] , and to directly or indirectly infect humans [2] . A recent paper describes the infection of a wildlife biologist with a novel paramyxovirus during a field trip to South Sudan and Uganda [8] . A recent study found that bats have, on average, significantly more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, which are also known to host a large range of viruses [9] . Additionally, the authors estimated that viruses had a broader host range in bats, averaging 4.51 host species per virus. Bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in various bat species across Africa, Australia, South America and Asia and recently the detection and characterization of paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats has also been reported [10] . Further to this, recent evidence places bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes to Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae [11] . Bat species can have very broad geographic ranges [9, 12] and multiple species can share the same habitats and even roost sites [13] .

Their evolution is related to human evolution and vice versa , resulting in an equilibrium in which both are able to coexist, sometimes without consequences for human health. However, the crossing over of the species barrier by some pathogens can have devastating consequences in terms of infections, public health and mortality. Several factors have highly impacted the spread of viral zoonoses throughout the world. Increasing globalization, increased mobility, changes in demography, environmental determinants such as ecologic and climatologic infl uences, and intense farming have increased the potential for transmission of pathogenic viruses between animals and humans (Kuiken et al ., 2005 ; Osterhaus, 2001 ) . Human and livestock populations have increased globally, causing closer contact between animals and humans. The human impact of changes in ecology and climate, together with faster transportation between countries and regions (faster than the incubation period of most of the infectious diseases), have accelerated the emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens. 'Emergence' means either the appearance of a newly evolved or a newly recognized pathogen, or the appearance of a known existing pathogen in a geographic area where it has never been found before. 'Re-emergence' is used to refer to pathogens whose presence is already recognized in a given area but which have increased in incidence (locally or globally, as for pandemics) or for pathogens which have seen their potential to cause severe infections in humans increase due to a shift in their ecology allowing, for example, the crossing of barriers from wildlife to domestic animals (as in the case of avian infl uenza) (Cutler et al ., 2010 ) .",38.88417987626494,15.93535307457641

Among market workers in the same study, handling live camels and either cleaning equipment (e.g., halters, water troughs, etc.) or administering medications to camels were risk factors on multivariable analysis (32) .

Moreover, importing reservoir hosts from their country of origin can be costly, and quarantines are required to ascertain that they are free of the zoonotic pathogens dangerous to humans.

PREDICT and its partners repeatedly sampled the bats and used PCR with consensus viral primers for nine viral families to saturate the discovery of new viruses in the species (Anthony et al., 2013b) . Using statistical techniques similar to those used for estimating vertebrate diversity, the total viral richness within the nine viral families examined in this host was estimated to be 58 viruses. In addition, it was estimated that there is a minimum of 320,000 mammalian viruses that have yet to be discovered in these nine viral families.

Following the emergence of the SARS-coronavirus, bats have come under intense scrutiny as the potential origin of the SARS outbreak and a source of zoonotic viruses. Surveillance in bats from around the world has shown that they are infected with a diverse range of coronaviruses. Even European bats have been shown to host a range of SARSrelated coronaviruses (Drexler et al., 2012b) although there is no evidence to suspect that these viruses are capable of jumping the species barrier to humans at the present time. A recent study screening illegally imported products of wildlife origin simultaneously demonstrated the species from which the product originated and detected the presence of retroviruses and herpes viruses within it (Smith et al., 2012) . In some instances, the original species were shown to be nonhuman primates and thus the viruses that infected these animals were theoretically adapted to primates and thus have a shorter ""species jump"" to humans and present a higher threat to the human population.

On the other hand, other viruses can infect multiple species and are considered to have a broad range of hosts. An example of a virus with a broad range is the rabies virus, which can infect animals and be transmitted to humans. Emerging viral diseases affecting humans, wildlife and agricultural have resulted from viruses infecting new novel hosts, a process known as a ""host shift"" (Longdon et al. 2014) or a ""host switch"" (Parrish et al. 2008 ). These shifts have caused pandemics in the human population, such as HIV from chimpanzees (Sharp and Hahn 2010) , severe acute respiratory syndrome from bats , and influenza virus from aquatic birds (Webby and Webster 2001) . Although the reservoirs of the influenza virus are in aquatic birds, swine also serve as another zoonotic source as evidenced by the 2009 H1N1 outbreak (Novel Swine-Origin Influenza et al. 2009; Fraser et al. 2009; Gatherer 2009 ).

They argue that the introduction of pathogens via global air travel and trade, the encroachment of human activities into wilderness regions, urbanisation, climatic changes and agricultural intensification are common drivers of emergence. For zoonotic diseases associated with wildlife reservoirs, anthropogenic factors that alter wildlife population structure, migration patterns and behaviour may also drive emergence of disease in human populations (Daszak et al. 2000 (Daszak et al. , 2001 . For example, human population encroachment into wildlife habitat may increase the risk of Lyme disease and other tick-borne encephalitides by driving the loss of less competent reservoir hosts and promoting a more efficient one, namely the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus (Ostfeld and Keesing 2000) . Likewise, the introduction of a ""new"" infection into a human or domestic animal population may follow the incursion of humans (accompanied by their domestic animals) into previously remote natural habitats where unknown disease agents exist in harmony with wild reservoir hosts. Upon contact with new species, an agent may jump species barriers, thereby spilling over into humans or livestock. Unlike the natural host, the new host may have no natural immunity or evolved resistance.

Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts are capable of remaining infective for long periods, particularly in cold and moist environments . The microscopic size and low specific gravity of infective stages facilitate their dissemination in water (Gajadhar and Allen, 2004 ). These stages are resistant to most of the routine disinfection methods used for drinking water, swimming pools and irrigation systems (Gajadhar and Allen, 2004) . Both Cryptosporidium and Giardia can infect their hosts at very low doses (<10 oocysts/cysts) (Okhuysen et al., 1999; Rendtorff, 1954) . Among different Cryptosporidium species infecting humans, C. parvum has a broad host range, including livestock, companion animals and wild animals; therefore, it can be transmitted via both anthroponotic and zoonotic routes . In contrast, Cryptosporidium hominis primarily infects humans, although experimental (Giles et al., 2001) and natural infections in livestock and other animals (Morgan et al., 2000b) have been reported in some instances.

An essential component of the control of these parasitic infections, from a public health perspective, is an understanding of the sources and routes of transmission in different geographical regions. Bovines are considered potential sources of infection for humans, because species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia infecting humans have also been isolated from cattle in molecular parasitological studies.

Nipah virus was highly infectious for pigs, with all classes of pigs susceptible. The pattern of on-farm infection was consistent with respiratory transmission; betweenfarm spread was generally associated with the movement of pigs. The extensive post-outbreak surveillance program in Malaysia showed that farms that did not receive pigs generally remained uninfected even when neighbouring farms were infected. Human infections were predominantly attributed to contact with live pigs; none was attributed to contact with bats. Horizontal transmission was not a feature of infection in humans (although the potential for person-to-person transmission was noted previously). Recommended host management strategies primarily target pig-to-pig transmission, secondarily the flying fox-pig interface (that is, the natural host-spillover host interface). The central strategy is the implementation of sound farm management practices, such as monitoring herd health and early recognition of disease syndromes. The latter includes maintaining the high level of farmer and veterinarian awareness of the disease generated by the outbreak. A second key strategy is the strict application of farm-gate biosecurity (Daniels 2000) , with clearly defined protocols for the introduction of new stock. These may include quarantine and/or exclusion testing. A Nipah virus vaccine is not currently available and development of one is unlikely in the near future. Overarching the above is a strategy of advanced planning for emergency management of disease outbreaks. This involves established surveillance, detection, and emergency response capabilities. The pre-existence of the latter in Malaysia enabled the implementation of effective quarantine, movement controls, and culling to bring the outbreak under control.

Ecological, social, or socioeconomic changes (eg, change in land use) alter the dynamics of pathogen transmission within the host or between hosts and allow the pathogen to expand within its host population, spread to a new region, or be transmitted to another non-human host population or species. Each of these changes increases the likelihood of the pathogen making contact with and spilling over into human beings (and thus progressing to stage 2). 1, 6, 7 The drivers that cause stage 1 emergence tend to be largescale environmental, agricultural, or demographic shifts-eg, moving of livestock to a region for the first time, or transportation of wildlife from a region for food. Such events happened before the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1997, after intensively managed pig farms and fruit orchards were built in a region frequented by fruit bats (the natural reservoir). These bats began to feed on fruit trees around pigsties, enabling viral transmission to pigs and stage 1 emergence. 14 Similarly, change in land use in Africa has brought livestock, people, and wildlife into the same habitat, leading to multidirectional pathogen transmission between livestock and non-human primates (stage 1), and some spillover into people (stage 2). 15 Stage 2 (localised emergence): initial spillover of a wildlife or livestock pathogen to people. Causes range from handling of butchered wildlife to exposure to fomites in wildlife markets or livestock farms, or in the wild.

Targeting of surveillance to such regions pro vides a rationale for better allocation of global resources to prevent emerging infectious disease or rapidly deal with outbreaks. 3 The process through which pandemic zoonoses emerge can be analysed to identify the crucial control points and specific research challenges (panel 1, figure 2 ). The model we adopt here (developed by Daszak) to assess pandemic potential has three stages-no human infection (stage 1), localised human infection (spillover; stage 2), and widespread transmission and global dissemination (stage 3). The frequency at which stages 1 and 2 occur is unknown but probably high. That human populations are continually exposed to a wide variety of non-human-animal pathogens, many of which infect human beings, seems reasonable to assume. To assess the role of pathogen biology in emergence, investigators need to know how many pathogens people are exposed to and how many successfully cross the species barrier. A complete inventory of spillovers is not available, but researchers have a good working know ledge of pathogens of domestic livestock and pets (species in frequent contact with human beings). Almost 50% of the roughly 1000 species of pathogens that are noted in livestock and pets are zoonotic, 17 implying that any barriers between these hosts and human beings are routinely breached by many different pathogens. More than 50% of the recognised pathogens of human beings can infect other vertebrate hosts. 18 Many non-human pathogens can infect several hosts, and clear examples of viruses transferring between different animal hosts to cause outbreaks in other species have been reported. 17, 19 Pathogens can transfer from human beings to animals and between different animal species before being trans ferred back to people, allowing remixing and evolution with spill-back and potentially enhanced pathogenicity (eg, influenza). 20, 21 Human pathogens from all taxa contain zoonotic species. Roughly 80% of viruses, 50% of bacteria, 40% of fungi, 70% of protozoa, and 95% of helminths that infect human beings are zoonotic. 18 Most of the identified reservoirs are mammalian (roughly 80%) or, to a lesser extent, avian, 18, 22 although people share some pathogens with invertebrates, which act as vectors 23 or inter mediate hosts. Identification of the key taxonomic groups that are sources for the emergence of zoonotic disease could help to improve targeting of surveillance and interventions. Ungulates are the mammalian taxa with which human beings share the most pathogens 17 -perhaps not surprising because, as major food sources, these animals are often in close proximity to people, and their diseases have been studied extensively. Rodents, carnivores, and primates are also well represented. Although pathogens deemed emerging or re-emerging are disproportionately likely to be zoonotic, 18 their reservoirs are much the same as those of non-emerging zoonoses. 22 The situation, however, is substantially different for pathogens that have reached stage 3. A disproportionate number of these pathogens are viruses, suggesting that viruses have the potential to evolve more rapidly than do other kinds of pathogen. However, this finding could be due to ascertainment bias. Less complete knowledge is available about the diversity of viruses than that of other pathogens, and researchers might still be missing many at stages 1 and 2. 24 Although a lot of stage 3 pathogens that infect only people don't strictly have reservoirs (eg, HIV-1), many are thought to have had zoonotic origins, including in nonhuman primates, which con trasts strongly with the minor contribution of primates as reservoirs for zoo noses in general. If risk is a function of contact frequency and probability of successful adaptation to human beings, pathogens acquired from other primates might already be better adapted to successful transmission than those from other mammals (exposure from rodents, bats, 25 and other common vertebrates are the most frequent).",43.74506998580803,17.129955397871516

For ex ample, SARS, which originated from the SARS-like coronaviruses of bats, emerged in China in 2003 and was due to hunting and trading of bats for food. 27 In the wildlife markets of southern China these bat viruses seemed to become stage 1 pathogens, which spilled over to civets before being trans mitted to people and achieving stage 2. 28 SARS coronavirus then underwent repeated cycles of transmission in people, and spread nationally and then globally (ie, reached stage 3), including 251 cases as far away as Toronto. Non-human hosts can have a role in the maintenance and transmission of some stage 3 pathogens (eg, influenza A virus). 20, 21 Of the 400 or so known emerging pathogens, roughly 100 occur only as human pathogens-ie, such specialisation is rare. 29 Some of the seemingly specialist human pathogens are thought to have had zoonotic origins much further back in evolutionary time (eg, Plasmodium falciparum). 30 This pattern could be the norm, but the origins of most specialist human pathogens are unknown. 13 Much more is known about the dynamics of pandemic pathogens once they can be transmitted among people. Transmission rates are often higher in dense than in sparse populations, and spread is often greatly enhanced by air travel or human migration. The mathematics of these spreading events is well known, and a sophisticated array of computational models have been used to backpredict such events accurately-eg, the first case clusters of SARS 31 and the subsequent global spread, including the country-by-country distribution of human cases. 32 Models based on air travel, realistic human contact networks, and individual countries' capacities to deal with outbreaks can now produce reasonably accurate predictions of future pan demic spread (particularly for influenza). [33] [34] [35] However, less is known about the factors that enable pathogens to move from stage 2 to stage 3 and ultimately achieve pandemic status. During this process, stuttering chains of novel human trans mission (as with human monkeypox in Africa, for example 36, 37 ) can become self-sustaining (which monkey pox has still not achieved in people 36 ). The distribution and behaviour of human beings, reservoir hosts, and vectors are crucial for emergence, and human demo graphics and behaviour often establish capacity for person-to-person transmission. Differential host physiology, especially age and immunocompetence, affect susceptibility to infection. 38, 39 The surge in immunocompromised patients during the HIV/AIDS pandemic was associated with an upsurge in other emerging pathogens. 7, 9 Host factors often receive less research focus than does pathogen virulence, but improved knowledge of host responses is essential to understand the species barrier and why some zoonotic pathogens are benign in their natural hosts but lethal when introduced to other species. 38, 39 In view of the importance of human activities in emergence, integration of social sciences research-particularly that focused on human behaviour and demographics-into models of infectious disease emergence and evolution is essential to understand pandemics. 40, 41 The importance of human exposure throughout the emergence process also suggests that simple behavioural precautions could greatly reduce risk. Risks to hunters, food handlers, and livestock workers from occupational exposure could be reduced in hotspots of emerging infectious diseases though routine sanitation and biosafety precautions, as has been tried with H5N1 in agricultural settings. 42 Nosocomial spread could be prevented by stringent adherence to infection control practices-eg, use of sterile injection equipment.",44.116948404658245,16.36892116224959

The vast majority of infections with enteric zoonotic bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, and Yersinia enterocolitica, probably occurs through this route. For other zoonotic pathogens, direct contact between animals and humans may also be an important route of transmission, this could be the case for Brucella spp., Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) or some newer strains of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Bacteria from production animals are widespread in the environment, mainly as a result of their presence in manure. Thus, the environment and wild fauna also transforms into reservoirs of foodborne pathogens and resistance, and forms a source of (resistant) pathogenic bacteria into the food animals and human reservoirs. Although consumption of wildlife is not considered a major route in many developed countries, wildlife is consumed at a substantial level in developing countries. In addition, because of generally lower bio-safety levels in rural animal keeping, contact between humans and food animals may in general be more frequent in these countries. For instance, the general understanding now is that the SARS epidemic in 2003 originated in direct human contact with and/ or consumption of, wildlife, or indirectly through contact between wildlife and domestic animals (Guan et al. 2003; Shi and Hu 2008) . Wildlife holds a broad spectrum of diseases including some of the most deadly ones. For this reason also the consumption of wildlife animals, and the spillover of infectious diseases from wildlife to food/production animal, is of global importance. Fig. 1 Schematic presentation of important microbial transmission routes via which the human and (food) animals are in contact with each other. In blue control mechanisms are shown and in red some of the transmission routes that cannot be controlled, or escape control. Via the environment transmission may take place, through microbes present in excretion products and diseased animals, and in some countries also diseased humans. Next to the animals that are produced for direct consumption, in many developing countries animals are used as working animals to produce food and are thus included in this scheme. in these scheme. These animals when old or ill are often consumed (red dashed line), rather than destructed. Wildlife holds a broad spectrum of diseases including many highly pathogenic and deadly diseases. Though, the incidence may be low, because the associated risks are high, the consumption of wildlife animals and the spillover from wildlife to food/production animal is of importance. In Western countries wildlife is of lesser importance, however, in many developing countries and upcoming economies wildlife consumption may still be substantial, for instance in rural areas because of availability, as delicacies or other reasons. Moreover, in developing countries contact between humans and food animals may in general be easier and more frequent",44.49134157722555,16.70107368795948

Changing behaviors surrounding the active feeding of bitten fruit to domestic animals may provide a path to decrease mortality and morbidity in domestic animals and mitigate zoonotic disease emergence. Some initial possibilities might include cutting away bitten areas on fruit or washing fruit before feeding to domestic animals.

When fruit bats eat fruit, they contaminate the fruit with viruses in their saliva and urine; discarded fruit fall to the ground and is consumed by intermediate hosts, such as pigs, horses, and nonhuman primates; humans become infected by contact with or consuming products of the intermediate animal hosts. Flying foxes are thought to transmit NiV/HeV in Southeast Asia and tropical Australia. During the 1998 NiV outbreak in Malaysia, it is thought that pigs were infected by NiV by consuming mangoes contaminated by flying foxes. Mangoes were a food source for flying foxes, and discarded mangoes contaminated by the saliva and urine of the bats fell into the pigsties and were consumed by pigs, resulting in the cross-species infection of pigs and subsequently humans (Chua et al., 2002a) . HeV is endemic in flying-foxes in Australia. HeV spills over from bats to domestic animals, primarily horses, which amplify the virus and subsequently infect humans (Murray et al., 1995) . Bats contaminate a drip zone around trees where they feed or roost by excreting urine, feces and saliva (with partially eaten fruit). Horses may be exposed to HeV when consuming contaminated grass, fruit, feed or water; or when browsing or sniffing contaminated surfaces within this drip zone (Plowright et al., 2015) . Fruit contaminated by bats is also thought to transmit Ebola virus to apes in Central Africa (Leroy et al., 2005) . In the case of the 2003 SARS outbreak in China, the transmission of SARS-CoV from bats to humans was made possible by the special taste for wildlife cuisine, including civets, which acted as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV. In South China, civets are thought to strengthen health in winter, and the demand was so high that farming of this wildlife species was widespread. Trade of civets in live wet markets exposed other susceptible animals. Therefore, bat SARS-CoV was likely introduced into humans through civets and other animals (Liu, 2003) . As for MERS in Middle East, dromedary camels are hypothesized as intermediate animals to transmit MERS-CoVs from bats to humans (Memish et al., 2014) . Camels are popular in Middle East countries both for entertainment and transportation. People may be infected through direct contact with infected camels, which can shed virus in respiratory secretions (Azhar et al., 2014) . MERS-CoVs were also detected in camel milk samples from mares infected with the virus (Reusken et al., 2014) .

In recent years, viral metagenomics may provide a glimpse of bat viral diversity (Dacheux et al., 2014; Donaldson et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2012; He et al., 2013) . So far, viruses detected in bats can be classified into as many as 22 families and many are novel viruses (http://www.mgc. ac.cn/DBatVir/). The pathogenicity of many of these novel viruses for humans remains unknown, and further efforts are needed to determine their potential threats to humans. In addition, previously known bat-borne viruses are also being detected in more bat species, and the geographic distribution of these viruses is also expanding. With human activity increasingly overlapping the habitats of bats, emerging infectious diseases from bat-borne viruses will undoubtedly increase. Transmission modes discussed above are just current hypothesis that could theoretically explain some of the spillover events. However, the spillover process is still something of a black box that is scarcely understood and much more research is needed to expand our understanding of the spillover events. There are many questions that remain to be answered about the ecology of bat-borne infections: (1) Are bats the natural reservoirs or just transient carriers of these novel viruses? (2) How long can bats harbor these viruses? (3) What are the routes of virus shedding? (4) How long can viruses excreted by bats survive in the environment?

They are either proven or potential reservoirs and vectors of zoonotic human pathogens, especially viruses. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Viruses from 24 different families have been detected in bats, often without obvious deleterious effects on their hosts, leading to the suggestion that peculiarities of their immune system may allow them to resist the effects of viruses that are highly pathogenic in other mammals, including human beings. 6 Transmission may be direct, by bat bites or scratches, or through more subtle contact such as touching intact mucous membranes or inhalation of aerosol created by bats' urine; or transmission may be indirect, by infecting other mammalian hosts, or by creating in their accumulated feces (bat guano), a culture medium for pathogenic fungi whose spores may be inhaled by people entering bat caves. Bats may damage fruit crops, and cattle and other domestic animals are vulnerable to bat-transmitted infections. In Latin America, vampire bat-transmitted bovine rabies (""derriengue"") and trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma evansi infection causing ""surra"") threatens meat production. Nipah virus causes fatal disease in pigs in Southeast Asia, where epidemics have led to the culling of more than 1 million of these animals. Hendra, Menangle, and Tioman viruses have been responsible for fatal diseases in horses and pigs in Australia and Malaysia. However, bats are much less important, medically and economically, than rodents, although they host more zoonotic viral infections per species. Rats, mice, and voles are vectors and reservoirs of many prevalent zoonotic pathogens, such as Hanta and Arena viruses, plague bacillus, leptospires, rickettsiae, and parastrongyloids. Rodents also consume crops and food stores and damage human dwellings and installations. In their favor, bats are fascinating and beautiful animals that are protected and conserved in many Western countries and that benefit the environment by controlling insects, pollinating fruit trees, and distributing seeds. Bats are eaten medicinally in China families.

Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs 4 . However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species likely harbor the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries 5-7 . Here we conduct the most comprehensive analysis yet of mammalian hostvirus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species, and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy, and human population within a species range -which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate for the first time that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.

These are important findings because they can inform field and surveillance studies, which are costly and difficult in most areas where EVD outbreaks occur and for the species linked to EVD.

For pets and zoo animals, tools similar to the ones proposed can be adapted because these animals are regularly seen by veterinarians. Wildlife can be a source of new farm animal or human diseases and is affected by many farm animal diseases (Table 1) . Thus, all observations of health problems in wildlife can potentially contribute relevant information for human or domestic animal populations (37) . However, the ability to closely monitor clinical signs is lacking. Death rate is the most feasible way to monitor wildlife health and has indeed been the detection trigger of many emerging diseases (38) . Testing sampled healthy animals for a set of diseases is another strategy, but few disease surveillance programs not targeted at specific diseases are in place (e.g., ""marine mammal strandings"" project in United Kingdom [39] ). One of the key challenges remains to bring professional and amateur outdoorsmen to report wildlife health observations through an information system flexible enough to encompass all species and situations. New forms dedicated to wildlife with appropriate location (instead of client or farm) could be added to the information systems already adapted to several species (VetPAD and ""émergences""). Alternatives such as monitoring risk factors for emergence (e.g., encroachment of habitats), as well as minimizing contact between domestic and wild species by good, onfarm biosecurity, could reduce the likelihood of new domestic animal or human diseases emerging from wildlife reservoirs. In all cases, approaches must seek to increase collaboration among wildlife and domestic animals health workers to break down traditional boundaries between fields.",52.67627232643129,19.36421502759314

Such viruses have existed in bats for a long time, and the question, therefore, is why they suddenly jumped to human hosts. The virus might have been transmitted to humans in ancient times but has only been discovered recently. It is more likely, however, that the jump to human hosts can be attributed to changes in human lifestyle. Thus, one potential future plan to restrict infection would be to limit direct and indirect contact between bats and humans. In the meantime, understanding these routes of transmission may help us to prevent future outbreaks of known and/or currently unknown diseases that leap from bats to humans directly or via intermediate animal amplifiers. Although the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV has not yet been identified, its high sequence similarity to bat viruses is suggestive of an origin in bats. A MERS-CoV sequence identical to that of the virus isolated from an index-case patient in Bisha 2c EMC/2012 was detected in a faecal pellet from Taphozous perforatus. The bat sample was collected \12 km from the home of the index case in an abandoned date palm orchard and \1 km from his place of employment. The research team observed roosting bats and guano in abandoned wells and ruins in the nearby areas [45] . Interestingly, Al-Ahsa is ranked among the most important date-palm-production cities in Saudi Arabia. It is likely that food or water of farm animals in areas with palm orchards may be contaminated with bat guano, saliva, and/or urine, and this may constitute an indirect mean of transmission to people. MERS-CoVrelated viruses have not yet been detected in fruit bats. Meanwhile, drinking of raw sap is not known in the Arabian Peninsula, so the scenario of drinking raw date palm sap that has been identified as a risk factor for human Nipah virus infection [42, 55] is an unlikely possibility.",43.58915707808776,16.408763478395493

In a period of 64 years ) the emergence of 335 infectious diseases (all pathogens combined) was reported. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are dominated by zoonoses, the majority of which (72%) has wildlife origin. The increasing and ongoing documentation of novel animal viruses identified worldwide predicts that additional animal pathogens may jump species barrier to potentially become novel human infectious diseases in the near future, some perhaps highly pathogenic. Viruses account for 25-44% of all EIDs [5] and are the pathogen class most likely to emerge [6] with an estimated number of undiscovered mammalian viruses of at least 320,000 [7] . This estimation suggests that zoonotic EIDs represent a serious threat to human health and emphasizes the importance to evaluate the factors that are involved in the contact between human and animals, responsible for the emergence of ""zoonotic-human"" infections [5] . [8] , as the increasing contact between humans and wildlife habitats mainly due to agricultural practices and the globalization of travel and trade. Other important factors include climate changes that promote vector expansion (mosquitoes, ticks) and mass human migrations (due to wars, natural disasters, poverty, and desertification) [9] . For these reasons, there is now a clear increased risk of arbovirus emergence in the future due to environmental and climate changes, extensive tropical urbanization and to the colonization of this expanding habitat by highly anthropophilic mosquitos (i.e. Chikungunya and dengue viruses both transmitted by Aedes aegypti). To date, dengue viruses are internationally recognized as an existing threat to blood safety due to a known transfusion-transmission and severe/fatal disease in recipients [10] . As all arboviruses are potentially transmissible by transfusion due to their capacity to induce an asymptomatic viremic phase, this represents new risks for blood safety.",37.789107997667855,15.387422487942597

Moreover, bats host the broadest diversity of coronaviruses including close relatives of humans coronaviruses, supporting the zoonotic origin of several humans coronaviruses Drexler, Corman and Drosten 2014) . Birds have also been suggested to be the gene pool of group 3 coronaviruses (Woo et al. 2009 ).The presence of influenza viruses in both waterfowl and bats suggested that transmission from birds to bats may have occurred in the past (illustrated with the arrow between the two host groups). As humans come rarely into contact with bats and waterfowl, they are more likely to become infected with zoonotic viruses via intermediate hosts, such as domestic birds or mammals. Usually, these zoonotic events are restricted to isolated cases of human infection with no onward transmission between humans subsequently. Rarely, upon mutation or reassortment, zoonotic viruses adapt to become humanto-human transmissible, and may start a pandemic and become endemic in humans. Numerous viruses of animal origin are endemic in humans (outer circle). Four influenza pandemics have occurred in the last century.

And third, to reduce the probability that pathogens become established and transmissible within a new host population once spillover occurs, the husbandry of high-density monocultures of domestic animals, particularly in areas at high risk of spillover, should be subject both to more intensive surveillance and to measures that reduce contact between wildlife and livestock.

As with viruses, the role of bats in disseminating these agents to humans or domestic animals is not always clear, but the potential for transmission does exist. Among diseases caused by fungi, histoplasmosis is the human disease most associated with bats. Guano enriches the soil and results in optimal growth conditions for this fungus. 36 Under proper environmental conditions, the fungus produces spores and may cause an acute respiratory disease when inhaled by humans or other animals. Individuals visiting caves with large bat populations are at particular risk, and the disease has commonly been called ""cave sickness."" 36 Other at-risk populations include people working around bat feces, and sporadic cases may be associated with colonies of bats living in houses. The role of bats in causing human histoplasmosis is probably limited given that the infection rate among bats seems to be larger than the rates of human infection. 36 Bats themselves do not frequently succumb to histoplasmosis. In cases of naturally occurring bat infections, infection occurs via inhalation. 36 Histoplasmosis appears to infect and multiply in the intestinal tracts of some bats, and the bats disseminate the fungus both by shedding it in their feces and by producing guano. 36 Other species of fungi, bacteria, and parasites of bats with the potential to cause human disease have been found in bats, but no clear association exists between any of these agents and outbreaks of human disease. Wangiella dermatitidis, a pheohyphomycotic organism that causes skin disease in humans, has been isolated from the internal organs of multiple healthy individuals of bat species, including the pale spear-nosed bat (Phyllostomus discolor), the Pallas' s mastiff bat (Molossus molossus), the little yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnia lillium), and the silver-tipped myotis (Myotis albescens). 58 Blastomyces dermatitis has been isolated from the livers of the lesser mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma hardwickei hardwikei gray) and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Sporothrix schenckii, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, and M. canis have all sporadically been found in various species of bats. 56, 58 Bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Listeria, Leptosporosis, and Yersinia have been isolated from both sick and healthy bats. 3, 34 Streptococcus and Staphylococcus may act as opportunistic pathogens under the right circumstances. 43 Because of outbreaks of leptospirosis in humans, more organized efforts have been made to determine if bats may transmit the bacteria to people. Surveys of Australian flying foxes (Pteropus sp.) detected antibodies to leptospirosis, and bacteria were found in the renal tissue from 11% of individuals and urine from 39% of individuals, indicating the potential for spread. 18 Additionally, some evidence suggests positive leptospirosis titers in humans after exposure to bats. 18 Zoonotic parasites, including nematodes, cestodes, and protozoa, have been documented in bats. Specifically two species of Schizotrypanum, T. dionisii and T. vespertilonis, have been found in multiple species of bats, including the common pipistrella (Pipistrellus pipstrellus), Leisler' s bat (Nyctalus leisleri), common noctule ( N. noctula), the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus), and Brandt' s bat (Myotis brandtii). 30 T. d. dionisii has been found in the bat bug Cimex pipistrella, a parasite found in many bat roosts, and parasitic pseudocysts containing amastigotes have been found in the thoracic skeletal muscle of P. pipistrelllus. 30 Bats are unique in that regardless of the type of pathogen that they harbor, bats seem to tolerate the infections without developing noticeable disease. This ability for them to act as asymptomatic carriers is one of the most important aspects of bat-associated zoonoses. 14 How bats remain healthy while harboring pathogens that would kill other mammals is unknown. Some evidence suggests that hibernation may alter the immune system of bats. 13 Other evidence suggests that bats co-evolved with these pathogens. Lyssaviruses and rabies viruses seem to have evolved with bats, and Hendra and Nipah viruses are old viruses that may have circulated in flying fox populations throughout evolution. 26 Even if this phenomenon is the result of highly evolved host-pathogen interactions, it is unclear what variety of zoonotic bacteria, viruses, and parasites. At least 66 have been detected in bat tissues, and bats probably have a role in the propagation of these organisms. 40 These include rabies, Nipah, Hendra, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses, which are threats to human health. 14 However, despite this, ungulates, carnivores, birds, and primates are more important sources of zoonoses than are bats. 68 This does not mean that the threat is not serious. Characteristics in the life history of bats certainly favor disease transmission. Some species of bat may live up to 30 years, allowing infectious agents to persist in a population for many years. Flight allows them to spread disease over long distances. Some bats have been shown to wander as much as 393 km in a year. 38 Flying foxes are of particular interest as vectors because of their propensity to disperse over a large territory and to live in urban areas. Tioman virus, a paramyxovirus isolated from fruit bats (Pteropus spp) in Malaysia, is of unknown public health importance, but a correlation may exist between human seroconversion and a history of consuming fruits that have been partially eaten by bats. 70 In the case of the flavivirus Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), experimental evidence shows that bats may act to pass the virus to mosquitos. JEV causes approximately 40,000 human cases of encephalitis per year, and 25% of cases are fatal. 64 It is also possible that bats may indirectly pass viruses to humans through domestic animals. Hendra virus, a paramyxovirus, has caused serious outbreaks of human and equine respiratory diseases in Australia. During one outbreak, 21 horses and 2 humans were reportedly affected. Further research pointed to fruit bats and flying foxes as reservoirs for this virus, but little is known about how the virus circulates in the wild population. It appears that humans became infected through exposure to horses, not bats. It is possible that the horses became infected from bat contact. 68 Similarly, Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus related to Hendra virus, has been isolated from pigs and humans with encephalitis and respiratory illness. This virus appears most prevalent in areas in and around Malaysia and Singapore. Sporadic outbreaks of Nipah virus infection have been documented in these areas, and it appears that humans are most often infected by pigs, but serosurveys indicate that antibodies are prevalent in bats, including Indian flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus), the large flying fox (P. vamprus), and variable flying fox (P. hypomelanus). 68 Several of the other viruses that bats harbor pose a serious threat to human health. Bats are the only nonprimates known to harbor Marburg virus and Ebola virus. 33, 39 Both viruses have been found in multiple species of African insectivorous and fruit-eating bats, including Egyptian fruit bats (R. aegyptiacus) and straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum). Prevalence rates of these viruses in the bat populations vary among different surveys. Estimates range from 1.4% to 3.1% prevalence in Egyptian fruit bats from Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo to 2.4% to 12% prevalence in other studies. It is known that clinically healthy bats can harbor the viruses and that they can remain seropositive for several months. Histopathology performed on a filovirus-infected bat, captured in Kenya, showed no lesions. Filovirus has been found in a clinically healthy pregnant Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), and radiotransmitter studies have shown that at least one bat lived 13 months after being determined to be seropositive for Ebola virus. 17 Neither the exact risk of transmission of filoviruses from bats to humans nor the mode of potential transmission is clear. Scattered cases of human Marburg virus infection have been associated with a history of visits to caves in Africa with large bat populations. 33, 39 Bats have also been implicated as reservoirs for SARS virus, SARS-CoV, which emerged in China and resulted in over 900 human deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-seropositive species of horse-shoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.), and the Leschenault' s rousette (Rousettus leschenaultia) have been found in China. No illness has been detected in bats, but it is possible that a SARS-CoV-like virus of bats was transmitted to humans through exposure to bats sold as bush meat in local markets. 26 causes these diseases to emerge and enter human populations. Given the precarious conservation situation of many bat species, further study is needed to determine how pathogens interact with the Chiropteran immune system and what environmental pressure may lead to the spillage of disease from bats to other animals.",36.88319711364952,15.844743720364338

Certainly reductions in the number of hosts can reduce the number of vectors 15 and also their infection prevalence 16, 17 , but empirical examples are relatively rare, in part because the issue has been neglected, and also because all else rarely remains equal. For example, the loss of hosts can cause compensatory increases in the abundances of other hosts, such that total host abundance changes little relative to total host abundance in more diverse communities. Even when total host abundance does decline in less diverse systems, differences in host quality among species can alter simple correlations between host abundance and infection risk 18 .",37.450827534531506,14.557299373981587

Traits that make a host resilient to biodiversity loss may also make them susceptible to pathogen infection and transmission. Such a relationship would explain the frequency with which the link between diversity loss and disease transmission has been observed in nature ( Table 1 ). For plants, species that are fast-growing and nutrient-rich with relatively high metabolic rates-characteristics of 'weedy' speciescan be more competent hosts for arthropod vectors and plant pathogens than those with less weedy traits 25 . Plants with these weedy traits are also more likely to become more abundant when plant diversity declines 26 . Consequently, the very species that have traits permitting persistence in degraded and species-poor ecosystems are also more likely to carry high pathogen and vector burdens. A similar pattern may occur in vertebrates-resilience in the face of disturbances that cause biodiversity loss, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, is facilitated by lifehistory features such as high reproductive output and intrinsic rates of increase 27 . Vertebrates with these features tend to invest minimally in some aspects of adaptive immunity [28] [29] [30] ; we hypothesize that this may make them more competent hosts for pathogens and vectors. Understanding the interrelationships among pathogen transmission, biodiversity loss and interspecific differences in immune function is an important area for future research.

This demonstrates the importance of this co-evolutionary relationship. Bats are one example of a group of mammals that has a long co-evolutionary history with the viruses that they harbour. Although infection with viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus seems to result in little pathology in bats, the infection of other species often causes severe disease and has fatal consequences. Bats might have become able to coexist with viruses through the evolution of unique immune mechanisms associated with the control of viral replication. It has also been suggested that the severe pathology and disease that often occurs as a result of the spillover of viruses into other vertebrate hosts may result from the disturbance of this finely tuned interaction of viral proteins with their targets in host cells 13 .

Early case studies in the United States failed to show a significant increase in risk associated with outdoor recreation (e.g. Bowen et al., 1984; Ciesielski et al., 1989; Falco & Fish, 1989) but Smith et al.'s (1988) research found that persons who had spent more than 30 h per week in outdoor activities in endemic areas were 2.5 times more likely to test positive for Lyme disease. Since the 1980s, a small body of literature has evaluated the occupational risk for Lyme disease. In New York, Schwartz and Goldstein et al. (1990) confirmed that Lyme disease is a hazard of outdoor work and a study in New Jersey found that outdoor workers were nearly five times more likely to have contracted Lyme disease than indoor workers (Bowen et al., 1984) . In the broader international and tickborne disease contexts, the research shows similar relationships between tick exposure and infection. In Lithuania, Motiejunas, Bunikis, Barbour, & Sadziene (1994) report that those at highest risk for a tick-borne disease (established through seropositivity testing) are outdoor workers (32 percent tested positive/N ¼ 6187).

Two studies in Poland involving serological testing of both ticks and humans confirmed that those who perform work in forest environments are regularly exposed to tick-borne disease pathogens and as such, are at a higher risk of infection. Two Dutch studies of Lyme disease seroprevalence in outdoor workers showed a statistically significant risk (OR, 3.7; 95 percent CI, 1.5e9.7 and OR, 15.0; 95 percent CI, 5.5e42.0) relative to the control group (Kuiper et al., 1991; van Charante, Groen, Mulder, Rijpkema, & Osterhaus, 1998) . In 2002, Piacentino and Schwartz published a meta-analysis of articles on the occupational risk of Lyme disease and report that the scientific evidence demonstrates that those who work outdoors in endemic areas are at an increased risk for contracting Lyme disease because of their exposure to ticks. It is evident in this body of literature that exposure to ticks is the single most significant human risk factor and the first line of defence against tick bites should be avoidance of these areas completely or seasonally (during periods of high tick activity), or where appropriate, control of the tick population.

The absence of rosters or registries, or sufficient, wellorganized exposure data, makes subsequent responder health research studies difficult to conduct, and quite probably less accurate because identifying the universe of response and remediation workers and reconstructing potential exposures after a response has concluded can be very difficult if not impossible. While not usually considered research, per se, baseline activities nonetheless provide critical information that is fundamental to supporting any future investigation or study and should be standard practice in any emergency that entails workers entering uncharacterized or uncontrolled environments, regardless of whether a decision to conduct a responder health research study has been made. Additionally, baseline activities often inform the need for responder research, assist in hypothesis generation, and/or help determine the feasibility of the proposed research.",39.529048018888126,14.411079461010715

Aerosolized release of 100 kg of anthrax spores upwind of Washington, DC, could result in approximately 130 000 to 3 million deaths, a weapon as deadly as a hydrogen bomb. Other means of delivery could be food and water (food-borne and waterborne pathogens) when human exposure to waterborne infections occurs by contact with contaminated drinking water, recreational water, or food. This may result from human action, such as improper disposal of sewage wastes, or be due to weather events. Heavy rainfall and runoff influence the transport of other microbial and toxic agents from agricultural fields, human septic systems, and toxic dumpsites. Rainfall can alter the transport and dissemination of microbial pathogens (such as cryptosporidium and giardia), and temperature may affect their survival and growth. This group includes infectious diseases for which the environment (e.g., food and water) plays a significant role in a pathogen's transmission cycle. Transmission occurs between humans and the environment directly (cholera, hepatitis A, enteroviruses, noroviruses, shigellosis). These pathogens survive in the environment for long periods of time. Fomites with personal infiltration of suicidal bio-bombers in the targets or by different facilities like mail might be a mean of delivery. Even animals, like birds infected with avian influenza, might serve as vectors for infectious diseases. In vector-borne diseases, transmission occurs through contact between humans and vectors (defined here as arthropods that take pathogens from one host to another). Transmission cycles share common attributes: namely, all are affected by the population level and vector, and all are driven by a transmission potential governed by a number of biological and environmental characteristics. Environmental changes can affect population levels of the host, vector (vector survival and reproduction), or environmental stage of the pathogen (pathogen's incubation rate within the vector organism) as well as the transmission rate (vector's biting rate) at which pathogens move between hosts, vectors, and environment. Vectors, pathogens, and hosts each survive and reproduce within a range of optimal climatic conditions: temperature and precipitation are the most important, although wind and daylight duration are also important. The recent crossover to humans of the Nipah virus is related to a host of changes that create more favorable conditions for their spread. Often fatal Nipah virus, normally found in Asian fruit bats, is believed to have passed over to humans when bats lost their habitats due to forest fires at Sumatra and the clearance of land for palm plantations. Trying to find new food, bats came into contact with pigs, which, in turn, passed the disease to their human handlers in the late 1990s. Nipah infection causes severe encephalitis in humans, with a 40% mortality rate recorded among infected patients in Malaysia and Singapore. At least 109 people died as a result of the epidemic, and more than one million pigs were destroyed in an effort to control the disease. Soil can also be the medium of transmission (B. anthracis, Giardia lamblia, Burkholderia mallei and pseudomallei, Co. burnetii).",40.04351214173111,13.9599349027965

The ecology of the reservoir hosts as well as other competent species can be used to target disease management and mitigation (See Box 3). The importance of this is clear when considering pathogens such as Ebola virus, where we have only recently discovered the probable reservoir (Leroy et al. 2005 ), yet often cannot trace the transmission events from bats to nonhuman primates and/or people. Further, new surveillance is finding evidence for Ebola-like viruses in natural mammal reservoirs (e.g., bats and primates) well outside of their previously known range in Africa (Nidom et al. 2012; Olival et al. unpublished data) . These recent findings point to a more urgent need to implement general, not pathogen-host specific, strategies to prevent zoonotic disease spillover from wildlife, i.e., by targeting transmission pathways or specific groups of hosts as were mentioned above. Highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 is a good example of the importance of understanding the ecology and epidemiology of a zoonotic disease in wildlife. This strain of avian influenza was first diagnosed in people in 1997 and in subsequent outbreaks has had an observed case fatality rate up to 84 % (Kandun et al. 2008) , although seroprevalence data indicate that it may be as low as 14-33 % (Li et al. 2008) .

Current strategies for controlling or preventing HeV epizootics are built around the three hypotheses for virus transmission from fruit bats to amplifying hosts listed above. They have centered around management strategies for horses rather than fruit bats and include minimizing exposure by stabling horses at night, excluding from horse paddocks, trees that bear fruit favored by fruit bats, and implementing quarantine and stock movement controls Mackenzie et al., 2003; Mackenzie and Field, 2004) .",60.236932621415036,22.96494903972293

Logically, superspreaders create hotspots of transmission around them, and hosts in a disease hotspot by definition experience increased infection pressure compared to others in the population. For example, interspecific transmission heterogeneities in Lyme disease can theoretically lead to environmental hotspots because fragmented habitats often support a higher fraction of competent amplification hosts, which could increase disease risk (e.g., measured as nymph infection prevalence) in disturbed landscapes (LoGiudice et al. 2003) . Environmental 'hotspots' that occur due to temporary aggregation of hosts, for example, at a watering hole, could also facilitate individual superspreading by serving as a source location for infection of highly social individuals that disperse from the location and infect many others. Finally, heterogeneity occurs both among and within species, and amplification species may contain one or more superspreading individuals. For example, domestic dogs account for the majority of rabies cases in parts of rural Tanzania, and infected dogs vary substantially in their biting rates, such that in addition to being the dominant amplification host in the system, some domestic dogs account for a disproportionate number of rabies transmission events (Hampson et al. 2009 ). These patterns suggest that further developing a framework integrating transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space should be a priority for future research in disease ecology (Box 2).",49.737787116113786,18.840241127203125

Robust surveillance systems in wildlife and at the livestock-wildlife interface to provide early detection of newly emerging EIDs or spillover and spillback of pathogens between livestock and wildlife is essential. Developing a comprehensive national monitoring system for EIDs in wildlife that is logistically and fiscally sustainable could yield economic benefits for livestock health management as a whole by reducing indemnity costs associated with spillover of disease from wildlife to livestock or by helping prevent spillover from livestock to wildlife through early detection. The objectives of such a system could be enhanced by close integration with existing livestock and wildlife health programs to guide ""when"", ""where"", and ""how"" surveillance is conducted. In addition, existing programs would benefit from closer working relationships between wildlife biologists, ecologists, epidemiologists, and veterinarians to improve efforts focused on reducing pathogen transmission (Boadella et al., 2011) . One obstacle to developing long-term, comprehensive surveillance efforts at the livestock-wildlife interface is inconsistent funding for these activities (Leighton et al., 1997; Stitt et al., 2007) . Funding has typically been in response to emergency directives (e.g. HPAI H5N1 surveillance) and focused for a short period until the threat is perceived to no longer exist. This has, predictably, generated problems for developing a comprehensive national infrastructure that can be maintained over the long-term. In addition, there are disease systems that have plagued agriculture for decades, such as bovine tuberculosis, that do not obtain sufficient levels of funding to fully address risks for introduction into new wildlife hosts such as feral swine (Sweeney and Miller, 2010) . Another challenge faced by wildlife surveillance systems is that they often rely on hunter observations and reports, which are focused on game species. This increases the difficulty of identifying emergence of disease in non-game species. Finally, due to challenges associated with working across agency departmental boundaries, such as reduced communication, differing priorities, perceived competition in missions, and cultural differences wildlife surveillance efforts often remain less than fully coordinated which reduces their overall benefit.",41.26777224222174,16.692922935563054

This has led to increasing realisation of the interconnectedness of ecosystem and human health leading some to propose that emerging diseases exist within a finely balanced host-pathogen continuum between wildlife, domestic animal and human populations (Daszak al., 2000) . Anthropogenic environmental changes can therefore have significant consequences for conservation as well as public health through promoting the emergence of both zoonotic and wildlife diseases. The connections suggest that a transdisciplinary approach is needed to tackle the challenge of emerging diseases and conservation.

For example, experimental exposure of six grass species to Barley Yellow Dwarf virus suggested that plants with a ""quick return"" phenotype (e.g., high leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, and metabolic rates) had increased host susceptibility, competence, and vector population sizes, likely because their leaves offered more resources for vector and pathogen growth and were generally more poorly-defended (Cronin et al. 2010) . Such hosts enhance the population of infected vectors, increasing infection risk for co-occuring host species. Species that tend to have high population densities or highly social behavior may also be at increased risk of contracting pathogens for which transmission is dependent on host density, due to higher contact rates (Altizer et al. 2003) .

(For other kinds of pathogens, there may be other sources of human exposure, notably environmental sources or the normally commensal skin or gut flora.) Various factors have been examined in terms of their relationship with a pathogen's ability to jump into a new host species; these include taxonomic relatedness of the hosts, geographical overlap, and host range. The roles of both host relatedness and geographical proximity have been clearly established. Experimentally associations between the degree of crossspecies transmission of bat lyssaviruses and both the geographical overlap between bat populations across the United States and the phylogenetically relatedness of the bat species involved have been established. Primate species tended to share more parasitic species if they were both more closely related and had sympatric distributions. A broad host range is also associated with the likelihood of a pathogen emerging or reemerging in human populations. An illustrative case study is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). After BSE's emergence in the 1980s, well before it was found to infect humans as Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), it rapidly became apparent that it could infect a wide range of hosts, including carnivores. This was in marked contrast to a much more familiar prion disease, scrapie, which was naturally restricted to sheep and goats. With hindsight, this observation might have led to public health concerns about BSE being raised earlier than they were. Host range is a highly variable trait among viruses: some, such as rabies, can infect a very wide range of mammals; others, such as mumps, specialize on a single species (humans). Moreover, for pathogens generally, host range seems to be phylogenetically labile, with even closely related species having very different host ranges. Hence, the biological basis of host range is relevant to understanding pathogen emergence (Jones et al., 2008) .",38.956387064268185,13.808529391878343

Deforestation of tropical forests for commercial log industry and agriculture expansion and hunting of wildlife are major sources of increased human contact with wildlife zoonoses. Deforestation and road construction in virgin forests also displace small wildlife reservoir of infectious pathogens, result in dispersal to new habitat, and expose livestock and domestic animals to these microbes and indirectly to humans. This may have occurred in the US where new road construction caused dispersal of the white-footed mouse [Peromyscus leucopus] which is a reservoir for Borrelia burgdorferi and resulted in expansion of Lyme disease to new areas [78] . Hunting of wildlife is an ancient tradition that increases the risk of exposure to multiple zoonotic pathogens. Hunting for bushmeat involves contact with potential infectious pathogens at several stages: tracking, capturing and handling the animals, then butchering and transporting the carcass, and trading and consumption of the meat. Moreover, there is increased exposure to potential infected vectors while hunting. Africa poses the greatest risk for emergence of novel wildlife zoonoses which may threaten the health of the global population, by adaptation and transmission from humans to humans. Bushmeat trade and consumption and demand in West and Central Africa appear to be highest in the world, four times greater than in the Amazon basin, with about 4.5 million tons of bushmeat marketed for consumption annually or >287 g per person per day [79, 80] . Furthermore, the practice of hunting primates for bushmeat is still a common practice in Africa, which is associated with a particular high risk for crossover infection to humans, especially chimpanzees which are phylogenetically the closest to humans [77] . This is commonly believed to be a major factor in the emergence of HIV and Ebola virus from Africa. Other factors driving the emergence of novel zoonoses from Africa may include the ecologically diverse wildlife in large areas of tropical rainforests, new and changing patterns of land utilization, and the increased demand for bushmeat in urban communities [77] . The reverse pattern of transmission of domestic animal pathogens to wildlife to maintain a large natural reservoir of zoonoses is also possible, but transmission to humans would still be more likely to occur from contact with domestic livestock.

Available evidence suggests that ecological changes in the environment ecosystems, such as nutrient enrichment, often exacerbate infectious diseases caused by parasites with simple life cycles [75] . The mechanisms include changes in host and vector density, host distribution, resistance, and virulence/toxicity of pathogens. Many emerging zoonoses occur as a result of increasing exposures of domestic animals and humans to wildlife. Predicting the emergence of novel zoonoses will require tracking the general trends of emerging infectious diseases, analyzing the risk factors for their emergence, and examining the environmental changes that are influential [76] . Wolfe et al. [77] estimated that the three main factors that govern the emergence of new wildlife zoonoses are the diversity of wildlife pathogens in a region, the zoonotic pool; environmental changes that affect the presence of pathogens in the wildlife population; and the frequency of contacts of domestic animals and humans with wildlife harboring potential zoonoses. Emergence of a new infectious disease usually results from a change in ecology of the hosts or pathogens or both [76] . The frequency and density of wildlife infectious agents with the potential to cross over to humans appears to be greatest in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where humans are encroaching on large areas of previously virgin forests, i.e., in Africa, Asia, and the Amazon basin.

For example, in many cases, RNA viruses (such as rabies virus infection in humans) establish 'dead-end' infections in specific hosts, without subsequent transmission, which reflects imperfect adaptation. This indicates that there are constraints that inhibit viral adaptation to new hosts, perhaps owing to the fitness trade-offs that seem commonplace in viruses that need to infect different hosts or cell types 25, 96 . Therefore, infecting different hosts is likely to represent a major adaptive challenge for RNA viruses, despite their mutation rate. Examples are animal vector-borne viruses, which are less subject to adaptive evolution than their non-vector-borne counterparts, presumably owing to the difficulties that are associated with simultaneous replication in hosts as divergent as invertebrates and vertebrates 97 .

It proposes that a shift to ecologically based control, explicitly considering the natural history of wildlife hosts and their pathogens, is crucial in minimising the risk presented to humans, domestic animals and endangered species from zoonoses. This approach will also yield benefits for the conservation and welfare status of wild animals. Notwithstanding the complexities of specific relationships, the probability of a zoonosis being passed from wildlife into another host population, be it humans, domestic stock or an endangered wild species, is always influenced by several key parameters. These are the intensity of infection in the reservoir hosts; the size, or depending on the case, the density, of the infected host population; the degree and nature of the contact between infected individuals (or infectious particles in the environment such as infected faeces); and the susceptibility of the in-contact animal. (For indirectly transmitted parasites and pathogens, the role of vectors and/or intermediate hosts must also be considered.) Whether the zoonosis persists after initial invasion is also determined by the new host's population size. A great variety of models has been developed to describe the transmission dynamics of macro-and microparasites, taking into account the nuances of particular host and parasite population structures (Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000; Heesterbeek and Roberts, 1995; Scott, 1988; Scott and Smith, 1994 ).

An interaction between individual donor species, their pathogens, and a novel recipient host must occur for novel disease emergence to occur. Numerous ecological factors affecting the potential transmission arena, from denser host populations to increased interactions among donor and recipient host species, interact with evolutionary changes to increase the risk that pathogens such as H5N1 will emerge as a major threat to human health. Opportunities for evolutionary change increase with donor species population size leading to larger variation in the pool of pathogen strains, increased fixation of mutants with enhanced viral fitness as well as increased probability of recombination/reassortment. Although the evolutionary route by which pathogens such as H5N1 may change into efficient highly transmissable, human-to-human forms is unpredictable, knowledge of these evolutionary ecological mechanisms and the affects of specific social ecological factors is largely understood.

Even where programmes exist, they lack integration with surveillance in humans and domestic animals at both local and international scales. Disease surveillance in wildlife is usually driven by outbreaks in humans or domestic animals (Childs, 2004) . Virulent pathogens are, therefore, more likely to be detected than more benign ones (Williamson et al., 1986) . Such studies are also, by their nature, not designed to screen for a range of pathogens, so opportunities to investigate the epidemiology and ecology of coinfections are often lost.

In fact, such a scenario has been proposed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-related coronaviruses from bats to humans: the bats roosted in or near open markets that sold civets in China; viruses were transmitted to civets via faecal and/or oral shedding; and humans handled civets and raw or improperly cooked civet meat, thus completing the transmission chain from bat to human.

Increases in recipient-recipient R 0 to > 1 can arise either ''coincidentally'' or due to evolution in the donor host for specificity. Even if R 0 remains below unity, ecological factors such as increased recipient host density may lead to more onward stochastic transmission events, and slightly longer chains of transmission, thus providing the opportunity for a pathogen to evolve an R 0 > 1 ( Antia et al., 2003) .

A: Temporal change in the relative overlap between species: (i) early human history where small populations of humans and their human-associated species existed in a matrix dominated by wild species; (ii) an generalized intermediate stage where human populations and their associated domestic animal species have an increased overlap with wild species worldwide; and (iii) the current situation where humans and associated domestic animals dominate many landscapes worldwide. B: Specific events leading to exposure and infection of H5N1: i) spill-over of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) variants from wild to domesticated avian species; ii) reassortment of different strains among species increases pathogenicity; iii) onward transmission of HPAI in wet-markets and continued transmission, including iv) spill-back to wild avian species, and v) dispersal and movement across the metapopulation, between species associated with domiciles, wet-markets, free-grazing on rice paddies, and migrants leading to sporadic human infections, vi) clusters, and potential for vii) sustained human-to-human transmission in SE Asia, Asia, Europe, and Africa (as of June 2006).

There are a number of evolutionary implications resulting from larger effective host population size and other ecological factors that increase the likelihood of disease emergence. For example, inflated population sizes/densities due to habitat loss for wild host species and agricultural practices leading to crowding and mixing of both wild and domestic hosts results in increased genetic diversity of the pathogen population, increased opportunities for reassortment, and longer chains of transmission (higher instantaneous R 0 ) (Antia et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2004; Gilbert et al., 2006; Holmes et al., 2005; Kuiken et al., 2006; Mills et al., 2006; Olsen et al., 2006) .",35.91113372817962,13.860615058356176

Phylogenetic analysis and epidemiological data revealed that SARS-CoV has likely emerged from its natural animal reservoir, the bats, to civets and other game food mammals during their caging in the overcrowded and unhygienic wildlife markets of South China before further crossing the species barrier to humans [4] . This chronological sequence is compatible with the deletion of a 29-nucleotide segment in Orf8 as a consistent sequence feature of human SARS-CoV isolates [3] . Interestingly, recent data have shown that although bat isolates are the ancestral host to SARS-CoVs, the isolates from small carnivores such as civet and raccoon dog all cluster within the human SARS-CoV sequences with the small carnivore sequences being terminal branches of the human intermediate. Thus, a direct bat-to-human transmission followed by bidirectional transmission between intermediate mammals and humans has also been suggested as the chronological dynamics in the emergence of SARS-CoV [42] . It should be cautioned that this interpretation of the phylogenetic tree may be biased by the limited sampling of SARS-CoV in animal reservoirs relative to human patients. Without further data from animal surveillance, the plausible scenario of the civet being the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV in the early human cases could not be ruled out entirely. Nevertheless, both models support the crucial role of bats in these interspecies transmission events. This key finding of bats and other mammals as the natural and amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV led to the closure of most wildlife markets in South China followed by subsidence of the epidemic. Ensuing animal surveillance of bats and other animal species in this region led to the discovery of many more novel animal CoVs. Indeed, bat CoVs have been proposed to be the gene source of all Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, whereas avian CoVs are considered as the gene source of all Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus [43] [44] [45] [46] .",38.29596738965161,13.600562294277513

On the one hand, superspreading may involve fixed, genetic variants; some individuals might interact consistently and extensively with other hosts, vectors, or contaminated resources no matter where they occur. On the other, superspreading may only emerge in contexts where the behavior and physiology of individuals interact to produce amplified transmission potential and disease risk. If environments could buffer the effects of parasite burden on host performance (i.e., environmentally enhanced tolerance of parasites via better nutritional conditions in resourcerich locations), hosts may disproportionately generate new infections through high contacts with uninfecteds [45] . Likewise, in stressful environments, adversity may reduce immune defenses and/or defensive behaviors such that some hosts are more prone to become infected and infectious to others [45] . Such outcomes may be particularly likely at sites where humans, livestock, and wildlife all come into contact. Farms, open-air markets, zoos, and other similar sites may exacerbate disease risk for reasons involving the coming-together of competent species; however, risk may be exacerbated (or damped) in light of different plasticities among hosts driven by food resources, coinfection, and excessive use of antibiotics, which could polarize the microbiota of each potential host [45, 46] .",37.023056436949325,13.501485111594867

However, keeping reservoir host colonies can require specific animal husbandry techniques, may involve training animals to accept available food sources not eaten in the wild, and can require access to special facilities to maintain the animals (such as aviaries to harbor bats or birds) and to perform infections with viruses that are often lethal to humans. Moreover, importing reservoir hosts from their country of origin can be costly, and quarantines are required to ascertain that they are free of the zoonotic pathogens dangerous to humans.

Importantly, opportunities exist to utilize metagenomics data to prepare and possibly mitigate future emergence events. In seeking these goals, researchers need to consider the factors that drive emergence. In determinations of potential threats, exploring the variable spike S1 portion of bat CoVs to identify viruses capable of binding to human receptors is key. Similarly, targeting highly conserved genes like the S2 region of spike has allowed for the development of therapeutics with broad efficacy against current and potential future CoVs that emerge [28, 52] . In addition, understanding the mechanisms and impact of highly variable genes provides another metric for threat and identifies targets for the generation of attenuated vaccine strains. Together, these approaches provide a platform to leverage our understanding of how CoVs emerge from bat sources to prepare and potentially stem future disease outbreaks.

Each of these compartments in the model is influenced by various factors and interactions (e.g., factors which influence the state of the host, pathogen, and environment and the resultant interactions; see Table 8 .1 for examples), as well as the processes of sourcehost contact, intensity and duration of exposure, pathogen invasion potential for individual hosts (i.e., interactions between pathogens and the immune system), and onward transmission and adaptation within host populations. We find it insightful to Fig. 8 .1 Conceptual model of the process of pathogen spillover and emergence. The ellipses represent three conceptual components: reservoir (RC, either environmental or wildlife populations serving as an ecological system in which the pathogen is endemically maintained), intermediary host/vector (IHC) population that serves to transfer the pathogen from the reservoir to the focal host, and focal host (FHC), generally human or species of special concern (e.g., domestic or highly threatened species). The dotted lines represent three spillover boundaries between RC-FHC (SB1 direct transmission route), RC-IHC (SB2), and IHC-FHC (SB3) (the concatenation of these latter two constitutes the indirect transmission route) consider pathogen spillover as typically involving four conceptually distinct, transmission processes: spillover from the reservoir component (RC) directly to the focal host component (FHC) (i.e., spillover boundary 1, SB1), spillover from the RC to the intermediary host/vector component (IHC) (i.e., spillover boundary 2, SB2), spillover from the IHC to the FHC (i.e., spillover boundary 3, SB3), and host-to-host transmission within the FHC itself. Direct transmission across SB1 occurs between focal susceptible individuals and either individuals from reservoir species, the environment, or fomites (e.g., infected intermediary host fecal material or carcasses). Transmission across SB2 often presents an important bottleneck to pathogens ultimately entering FHC. Transmission Non-synonymous changes in the spike gene are found in viruses with sustained human-to-human transmission. These genetic changes are not found in viruses circulating in the reservoir host (palm civets) or spillover viruses that did not successfully move to the host epidemic space where sustained human-to-human transmission occurs (Pepin et al. 2010) across SB3 is generally the focal spillover process, particularly those vectored by mosquitoes and parasites. Transmission across these spillover boundaries may either result in a dead-end infection of a focal host, a stuttering transmission chain in the focal host (R 0 < 1 in FHC), or an epidemic outbreak (R 0 necessarily > 1 in FHS).",44.17835025031739,18.05189486954392

An analysis by Woolhouse et al. found ungulates to be the most important nonhuman host, both in terms of the number of zoonotic pathogen species supported as well as among emerging and re-emerging zoonotic species (Woolhouse 2005a) . In this review, we discuss emerging zoonotic pathogens of cattle, because they are one of the most important domestic livestock animals to human society (United States Department of Agriculture: Interagency Agricultural Projections Committee 2011). Unlike previous zoonotic reports involving cattle zoonoses (Hoar et al. 2001 , McQuiston and Childs 2002 , Abalos and Retamal 2004 , Bradley and Liberski 2004 , Arricau-Bouvery and Rodolakis 2005 , Collins 2006 , Davies 2006 , O'Handley and Olson 2006 , O'Handley 2007 , Mattison et al. 2007 , Cavirani 2008 , Indra et al. 2009 , Rodolakis 2009 , Ingram et al. 2010 , Seleem et al. 2010 , Torgerson and Togerson 2010 , this review will not focus on one or a select group of pathogens, but rather on the epidemiology of cattle zoonotic diseases due to their potentially substantial role in global public health. Previous reports have documented the characteristics of zoonotic pathogens, such as life cycle, geographic location, method of infection, and symptoms. However, other epidemiologic data, such as transmission, risk factors, prevalence, incidence rates, genetic evolution, and environmental risk factors, are often not available. Furthermore, few case reports are available documenting or discussing zoonotic transmission events of bovine pathogens. It is our belief that transmission events between cattle and humans occur predominantly through the bridging population of agricultural workers. Studying and educating these workers presents a unique opportunity to intervene in a number of disease transmission cycles. The recognition of the need for a comprehensive public health system has given rise to ''One Health,'' an integrative effort of multiple disciplines at the local, national, and global health levels to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment (American Veterinary Medical Association 2008). Hence, in this report we sought to not only summarize cattle zoonotic disease data to assist public health, veterinary health, and research professionals to identify areas that merit further study, but also to elucidate how such diseases may occur in a practical setting.",42.81958075673673,16.57034593134078

These results suggest that the risk of transmission to humans through the fecal route may exist, especially through guano farming or when bats are handled after being hunted (Thi et al., 2014) in areas where they are sold in markets or provide food resources (Lee et al., 2014) . In this study, the health status of the bats was unknown, and no study to date has reported clinical signs associated with astV infection in bats (Chu et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2011) .

Thus, without a better understanding of the risks to humans associated with bat astrovirus infection, there is a need for rural communities exposed to bats to be aware of the general potential risk of virus transmission associated with close contact, and improved guidance on how to handle the animals and reduce such risks.

It is the active steps of emergence (exposure, contact, invasion, and onward transmission), influenced by host-pathogen evolutionary processes, that ultimately determine the outcome of interactions among entities. In short, spillover and emergence are stochastic processes with outcomes that depend on the probabilities of the occurrence of underlying events. As we will make clear, the variability associated with spillover and emergence is large because the size of groups involved (vis-à-vis number of infected individuals) is small and hence subjects to the vagaries of sampling: it is only after sufficiently many of these events have been observed that we can begin to meaningfully characterize spillover and emergence in terms of expected rates of pathogen transmission. Using our framework, three key processes are delineated that determine (1) the occurrence of pathogen spillover from reservoirs either to an intermediary or directly to a focal host; (2) the occurrence of primary transmission from an intermediary to a focal host, when intermediary hosts play a role (which is in most cases); and (3) the occurrence of secondary focal hostto-host transmission required for true disease emergence in the focal host. We use the term true emergence to contrast with the observation of multiple focal host cases of an infectious disease arising exclusively from spillover (Antia et al. 2003) . Using emerging zoonotic disease examples, we explore this framework and provide recommendations for evaluating zoonotic outbreaks, managing interventions during outbreaks, and planning future research.",40.93094664568363,15.560232401531243

In many cases, primary pathways for transmission are identified during outbreak investigations after a disease has already emerged. However, it is likely that many more novel transmission pathways remain undescribed for pathogens that pose a potential human health risk. The recent emergence of a number of pandemic zoonoses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] , pandemic influenza H1N1), zoonotic viruses of pandemic potential (e.g., Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] coronavirus), and those of regional concern (e.g., Ebola virus), in addition to the increasing frequency of EID events ( Jones et al. 2008) , make the targeting of surveillance programs to early stages of emergence a crucial tool for combating pandemics (Morse et al. 2012 ). Our analysis also provides us with insights into which transmission pathways are important in regions where different drivers of EIDs predominate, thus allowing for more targeted prevention measures and surveillance approaches. This approach may have value for targeted surveillance of pathogens that are known to emerge through different pathways. For instance, although Nipah virus (NiV) has been attributed to preferential feeding by Pteropus bats on human-cultivated fruit or other plant products, as was seen with NiV in Malaysia (transmitted via mangoes fed to pigs) and Bangladesh (via date palm sap) (Chua et al. 2000 , the mechanism through which the disease emerged differed between countries. In Malaysia, agricultural intensification led to the planting of mango trees directly adjacent to intensively managed pig populations, attracting fruit bats to the area. This activity resulted in the initial spillover of NiV from Pteropus bats into intensively managed pig populations, leading to subsequent outbreaks to human via direct contact with live pigs (Chua 2003 , Epstein et al. 2006 , Pulliam et al. 2012 . In Bangladesh, the most frequently implicated transmission pathway from animals to people is via the oral transmission pathway, specifically ingestion of fresh date palm sap contaminated by bat excreta (Hughes et al. 2009 , Olival et al. 2013 . By targeting this and other potential routes of food contamination, surveillance efforts and control measures may better minimize the risk of zoonotic disease emergence.",37.169562435690096,14.601975510309373

As alluded above, pathogen exposure is the fundamental requirement for pathogen spillover in a new host and is influenced by the spatial overlap and density of infected and susceptible hosts. Here, various factors can influence the outcome of exposure. External forcings such as climate or extreme weather events are able to drive host and pathogen distributions and disease occurrence (Alexander et al. 2012b) . For example, El Niño Southern Oscillation events have been linked to increases in the number of Yersinia pestis flea vectors and rodent host populations, leading to increased pathogen invasion and mortality in prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies and colony extinction events (Stapp et al. 2004 ). Likewise, human behavior can influence domestic animal pathogen exposure to wildlife. For example, cattle herding behavior of dog owners influenced contact between African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and domestic dogs, exposing the wild dogs to canine pathogens and causing catastrophic declines in wild dog populations (Alexander and McNutt 2010) .",37.17552731238618,14.459595845450808

Human health objectives are focused on minimizing and preventing human morbidity and mortality associated with zoonotic disease transmission, and control efforts are directed at reducing or even eliminating initial spillover events. This public health perspective highlights the importance of characterizing spillover both qualitatively and quantitatively. Many emerging zoonotic pathogens present as a spillover epidemic only in the human population with R 0 ¼ 0 (e.g., anthrax) or a mixed epidemic type where there is spillover with highly inefficient human-to-human transmission (R 0 < 1 in the human host, e.g., Fig. 8.2 Mixed epidemic dynamics (a) shows spillover and onward transmission in a mixed epidemic (spillover epidemic and host epidemic). Blue circles are members of the reservoir population; red, the new host. Edges represent transmission. (b) shows exactly the same graph but explicitly separating the two populations. In (b), it is obvious that there are two separate processes, linked by a single event.

The appropriate interventions and surveillance methods for the two processes are different monkeypox virus). The immediate focus of control for many emerging zoonoses is not the reduction of infectious animals in the reservoir populations (the reservoir species may not even be known) but minimizing human behaviors and other factors that are thought to contribute to pathogen exposure and invasion risk in humans (e.g., Ebola; see below). In these instances, R 0 in the human or in the reservoir population is not the central factor of interest. Rather, we need to focus on the complex processes of zoonotic pathogen spillover that must occur in the first place.

SARS-CoV-2 has a high genetic relationship with a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) with a 96% genomic nucleotide sequence identity. The close phylogenetic relationship to Bat RaTG13 provides evidence for a bat origin of SARS-CoV-2 [6] . However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to the lack of direct contact between bats and humans. Hence, there are probably intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans. This speculation is supported by the reports about the intermediate hosts of other human coronaviruses. For instance, SARS-CoV, the coronavirus causing SARS epidemic in 2003, was also originated from bats [7, 8] , but it transmitted to human via a variety of intermediate hosts including masked palm civet cats and raccoon dogs [9, 10] . Since native reservoir hosts of viruses usually live far away from human community, intermediate hosts play critical roles in transmitting viruses to human and causing epidemics.

Dengue is the most important vector transmitted disease in Costa Rica, but research on the local factors that affect the disease system is scarce. Recent studies show the presence of dengue virus (DENV) in wildlife, including bats, but the role they play in the transmission cycle is unknown. The significance of wildlife in (re)emerging infectious diseases has been increasingly appreciated, and it is possible that some species of bats are susceptible to DENV. This research aims to evaluate the presence of DENV in domiciliary bats that inhabit areas of high and low incidence of dengue, in wet and dry season, in Costa Rica to identify ecological, environmental, anthropogenic and virological factors that could involve the bat in a possible viral transmission cycle. We sampled houses in which humans and bats cohabit, took samples from bats and blood samples from humans, and collected mosquitoes by EVS-CO 2 traps. According to the sample type, we determined the presence (RT-PCR and virus isolation) and frequency (serology) of DENV in bats (blood and pool of organs), mosquitoes and humans to determine the possible virus circulation in them. We performed necropsy on a portion of the bats collected and histopathology on shock organs (heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, brain), to observe any possible sign of sickness. Furthermore, we will establish the phylogenetic relationships of the strains of DENV obtained from bats, together with co-circulating human and mosquito strains collected by the reference center, by analyzing the E region sequences. Characterizing intra-host genetic variability in dengue virus (DENV) virus is paramount for understanding its evolution and population dynamics in its current status as a major human pathogen. The extent to which viral diversity accrues in infected hosts influences aspects such as pathogenesis, transmission and host immunity. Although there are several studies of intra-host genetic diversity of dengue virus infection, limited data have been reported for DENV-4 so far. In the city of Guaruj a in the State of Sao Paulo, the reemergence and spread of this serotype was associated with its co-circulation and with the displacement of serotypes 1-3 during recent outbreaks. Based on this epidemiological framework, we seek to identify the intra-host genetic variation of DENV-4 strains from samples collected during the 2013 outbreak using deep sequencing technologies. We will estimate the level of variability and the evolutionary history of these viruses in response to selective pressures imposed by an urban population previously exposed to the remaining three dengue serotypes. This study would also be the first effort to investigate the intra-host diversity of DENV-4. , and a clear division of ECSA clade into three subgroups (I-III), were defined by Bayesian analysis; similar results were obtained using E1 gene sequences.

This finding was further confirmed by phylogenetic networks (PHI Test, P ¼ 0.004) and phylogenetic tree incongruence analysis. The recombinant strain, KJ679578/India/2011 (ECSA III), derives from viruses of ECSA III and ECSA I.

As we collect epidemiologic data on the routes of transmission and sources of these infectious agents, we become better prepared to manage and mitigate their impact on humans. Camel milk and meat act as a point source for infection and should be managed with proper slaughter protocols, pasteurization, and improved overall sanitation practices. Dromedary camels also act as a significant source and amplifier for vector-borne disease; therefore, vaccination of camels, control of mosquitoes and ticks, insecticide application, and consistent screening will help control infection rates in camels and humans.

The importance of these positive diagnostics in urban bats relies, among other ecological factors, on the fact that bats may actively participate in the urban transmission cycles, as well as become a food source for the vectors of these pathogenic tripanosomatids (Lampo et al. 2000; Rabinovich et al. 2011) .

Studies with Candida, Histoplasma and Coccidioides posadasii fungi, although few, were capable to isolate these parasites and demonstrate that bats may play a role in their transmission cycles. Alphacoronavirus and Pneumocystis are important parasites responsible for respiratory diseases and pneumocystosis, respectively. The detection of Alphacoronavirus and Pneumocystis RNA/DNA in urban bat fecal samples and lungs point to the need of more investigation on their possible participation within these parasites life cycles. For leptospirosis, bats were found infected with at least four Leptospira species, its etiological agent, in different regions worldwide, including Brazil (Dietrich et al. 2015a) .

In Brazilian urban bats, however, the only study available suggests that bats do not contribute to the transmission of Leptospira in the city of São Paulo (Bessa et al. 2010) . These findings underscore the participation of bats in the transmission cycles of many diseases of public health relevance, along with others that are not included as notifiable disease, such as histoplasmosis. In this sense, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has strongly recommended the inclusion of wild fauna monitoring in health surveillance programs (OIE 2016 ). Yet, despite the fact that Brazil is a highly diverse country regarding both its bat fauna and zoonotic pathogens, it lacks government services devoted to wildlife surveillance.

Within those regions, wildlife biodiversity is highest, and it is clearly not feasible to sample every species of vertebrate across these large swathes of the Tropics. To identify the wildlife species that harbor the greatest proportion of potential novel zoonoses, we need to consider two factors: phylogeny and contact. Logically, it is more likely that a virus harbored by a wildlife species phylogenetically closely related to humans will be able to replicate in human cells following exposure. However, testing this hypothesis has not been the focus of a great deal of research effort, other than studies in plants [7] , bats [8] , and insects [9] . With large databases of virus-host relationships, global datasets on wildlife host traits and viral phylogeny, extending these studies to produce predictive models should be plausible. Ultimately these approaches could provide predictions of the risk of a novel agent discovered in wildlife spilling over into people. Importantly, they will provide a way to target the wildlife species with the highest potential for discovering novel pathogens of zoonotic potential. Viral spillover is also a product of the degree of contact that a wildlife host has with human populations. For example, pastoral communities on the edges of forests in Brazil, Borneo or Central Africa likely have a high degree of exposure to fomites from a high diversity of rodent species. If contact is more crucial than phylogeny, then viral discovery programs should target rodents rather than primates in hotspot countries. To test these ideas, and develop usable predictions, mathematical models that include global datasets on human contact with wildlife are required. Currently these do not exist. Our approach has been to use proxies for contact, based on the amount of anthropogenic disturbance within a region, in addition to the density of human population. These can then be correlated with results from large scale surveys of human populations across different gradients of disturbance to get more accurate data on likely wildlife exposure.",39.46231841830274,14.720424237109734

The pathogen is then endemic in the reservoir and the reservoir has a constant force of infection on the incidental host. The reservoir can be seen as an ecological system comprising several species or populations in order to maintain the pathogen indefinitely ( Haydon et al., 2002 ) . For example, bat and dromedary camel ( Camelus Dromedarius ) populations are involved in the persistence of MERS-CoV and in the transmission to human populations ( Sabir et al., 2016 ) . In these cases, the assumptions of a constant force of infection can be valid because the pathogen is endemic. However, zoonotic pathogens can spill over multiple incidental hosts and they can infect each other. In the case of the Ebola virus, which infects multiple incidental hosts such as apes, gorillas and monkeys ( Ghazanfar et al., 2015 ) , the principal mode of contamination of the human population is the transmission from non-human primate populations. Moreover, the contact patterns between animals and humans is one of the most important risk factors in the emergence of avian influenza outbreaks ( Meyer et al., 2017 ) .

We found that human population density was a common significant independent predictor of EID events in all categories, controlling for spatial reporting bias by country (see Methods, Table 1 and  Supplementary Table 3 ). This supports previous hypotheses that disease emergence is largely a product of anthropogenic and demographic changes, and is a hidden 'cost' of human economic development 2, 4, 7, 9, 13 . Wildlife host species richness is a significant predictor for the emergence of zoonotic EIDs with a wildlife origin, with no role for human population growth, latitude or rainfall ( Table 1 ). The emergence of zoonotic EIDs from non-wildlife hosts is predicted by human population density, human population growth, and latitude, and not by wildlife host species richness. EID events caused by drug-resistant microbes are affected by human population density and growth, latitude and rainfall. The pattern of EID events caused by vector-borne diseases was not correlated with any of the environmental or ecological variables we examined, although we note that the climate variable used in this analysis (rainfall) does not represent climate change phenomena. Our study examines the role of only a few drivers to understand disease emergence, whereas many other factors (for example, land use change, agriculture) have been causally linked to EIDs 6,21 . However, until more rigorous global data sets of these drivers become available, data on human population density and growth act as reasonable proxies for such anthropogenic changes.

Thus, we urgently need research on these viruses and the ecologic, entomologic and host determinants of viral maintenance and emergence (Blum et al. 2016) .

However, given the potentially important epidemiological consequences of either of these scenarios, it is important to explore these possibilities. Our results are a first step in identifying ecological characteristics of those regions with the highest risk of a potentially significant role for non-human hosts. We hope that this will raise the interest of Mexican public health authorities and academic institutions in considering the risk arising from potential non-human hosts of ZIKV.

Therefore, a major short-term goal should be to conduct specific, directed studies of potential wildlife hosts involved in arbovirus maintenance. Although host selection by mosquitoes depends on a great number of factors, a first step should be to determine which wildlife species have a high risk of being in contact with the disease vectors in order to optimize resource allocation for these studies. The increased availability of spatial data and recent methodological developments in species distribution modelling (Stephens et al. 2009; González-Salazar et al. 2013 ) allow us to implement spatial analysis that can be used to build predictive models for the presence of emerging diseases. In particular, they allow for the direct incorporation of biotic factors, which are not explicitly accounted for in most niche modelling studies, including inter-specific interactions, as well as abiotic factors. Biotic factors, such as host range, are obviously of crucial importance in the dynamics of zoonoses. The method uses point collection data for potential/known vectors and potential/known hosts and constructs a diagnostic, epsilon (Stephens et al. 2009 ), that measures the statistical significance of the degree of co-occurrence of a pair of species (e.g. a potential vector and a potential host) relative to the null hypothesis that they are uncorrelated. In the present case, the mammal data set used contains 37,297 unique point collections from geo-referenced localities for 427 terrestrial mammals occurring in Mexico (GBIF; www.gbif. org, and CONABIO; www.conabio.gob.mx). For A. aegypti, there were 302 collection points taken from the Sistema Nacional de Informació n sobre la Biodiversidad of the Comisió n Nacional para Uso y Conservació n de la Biodiversidad (www.conabio.gob.mx). Co-occurrences were defined on a uniform grid covering Mexico of 3337 rectangular cells of size 25 km 9 25 km. With these data, a predictive model for the potential distribution of A. aegypti in Mexico was created based only on biotic factors. This approach gives us two principal results: (1) a ranked list of mammals that can potentially be blood-meal sources for the mosquito and therefore potential hosts and (2) a map of potential presence of A. aegypti linked to the presence of potential mammal hosts (Stephens et al. 2009 ).",43.25864761442587,17.881632924871898

Consequently, humans could be at high risk of infections from pathogens circulating within the blood system of other wildlife vertebrate species (Kaddumukasa et al. 2015) . Due to their current relevance to public health, the identification of mosquitoes' wildlife blood-meal sources and their relative importance is important in order to determine the linkages between potential hosts and vectors. The arboviruses ZIKV, dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) have been isolated from several Aedes mosquito species (Klimpel and Mehlhorn 2014) , most notably Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which are widespread worldwide (Grard et al. 2014; Kraemer et al. 2015) . Although other mosquito species have been identified as having links with these viruses, A. aegypti has generally been considered to be the most relevant in Mexico. However, the role of potential wildlife hosts in maintenance of these arboviruses has received relatively little attention, even though there are results that indicate that they are not necessarily restricted to epizootic cycles in the New World. For instance, although DENV is widely believed to be absent from New World wildlife, all four serotypes of DENV have been found in a wide variety of South American mammals in French Guiana (de Thoisy et al. 2009 ), including bats, rodents and marsupials. Notably, identified hosts were encountered in both DENV endemic areas as well as areas where the disease was nearly absent. Genetic evidence was provided that was consistent with the hypotheses that (1) there exist spillover infections from humans to mammals and (2) there exists an enzootic cycle.

West Nile, Chikungunya and Yellow Fever viruses are examples of arthropod-borne viruses that have jumped to new mosquito species. In particular, flying insects can greatly expand viral access to bird, wildlife and human hosts. While collecting samples from wildlife is a resourceintensive endeavour, large numbers of known arthropod vectors can be collected at much lower cost, making virus surveillance in arthropods an attractive goal. Furthermore, geographic information system-based maps that layer environmental measurements (temperature, precipitation, land use) and vector/host distribution data can be used to inform rational decisions about when and where surveillance samples should be collected. This approach has been used to correlate environmental factors with competent West Nile virus vectors trapped in urban areas of the north-eastern United States (Brown et al., 2008a,b) . Assembling such risk-based maps would concentrate surveillance efforts to maximize impact and minimize cost. While detecting genetic precursors to species jumps in sampled viruses is a long-term goal for which underlying knowledge is lacking, in the short-term, characterizing endemic viruses transmitted by local arthropod vector populations would provide baseline information required for future prediction. Such knowledge can be used to assess risk to human populations and drive mitigation strategies (e.g. vector control strategies).",39.794033905449645,15.627019591335552

Understanding the dynamics of influenza in human hosts sheds light on the potential of the human population to be infected by new strains, the probability that a spillover virus can acquire evolutionary adaptations to facilitate spread in humans and the abilities of intermediate hosts (such as chickens and pigs) to generate pandemic viruses. Seasonal influenza creates cycles of higher and lower immunity in humans: epidemics deplete susceptibles, leaving a higher fraction of the population with protective immunity. Some of this immunity has been shown to be cross-protective against viruses of other subtypes (e.g. infection with seasonal influenza can confer partial protection to infection with H5N1). In addition, the diversity of viruses circulating in humans should in theory correlate with the potential for an emerging virus to exchange gene segments with an adapted resident virus, which could increase the emerging virus's rate of transmission. Reassortment events are commonly associated with seasonal influenza and appear to be an integral evolutionary step in pandemics. The generation of pandemic viruses through reassortment depends sensitively on dynamics in the intermediate host population, including the amount of herd immunity in non-human hosts and the dynamics of viral diversity in that host population. Compared to humans, pig populations can contain a much greater diversity of H3N2 viruses, including antigenic variants of H3 HA that have long been extinct in the human population (de Jong et al., 2007) , but the rate of viral antigenic evolution in pigs is slower. As with humans, an important question is how host immunity, local climate, viral mutation and birth/death processes affect the observed patterns of influenza diversity. Understanding these basic processes should allow the long-term effects of interventions (e.g. culls, quarantines, antivirals and vaccinations) on viral evolution to be predicted and shed light on which steps (such as key mutations or contact rates between hosts) (Cobey et al., 2010) limit emergence.",36.86782865197091,14.679003704237143

Why Viral Diseases Are Emerging at an Increasing Frequency 225","Most zoonotic viruses that are transmitted to humans cannot be spread directly from person to person, so humans are considered to be ""dead-end hosts."" One familiar example is rabies, which is enzootic in several animal hosts, such as dogs, skunks, foxes, raccoons, and bats. Humans are infected by bite of a rabid animal or by aerosol exposure (in caves with roosting bats). Several zoonotic arenaviruses, such as Lassa, Machupo (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), and Junin (Argentine hemorrhagic fever) viruses, are likely transmitted from the reservoir host (wild rodents) by inhalation of contaminated aerosols. There are more than 500 viruses-belonging to several virus families-that are also classified as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses), based on a vertebrate-arthropod maintenance cycle in nature. Arboviruses replicate in both the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector (mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies, and others), and transmission occurs when the vector takes a blood meal. Typically, arboviruses have only a few vertebrate hosts and are transmitted by a narrow range of arthropods. Humans are not the reservoir vertebrate hosts of most arboviruses, but can be infected by many of these viruses, if they happen to be bitten by an infected vector. In most instances, arbovirus-infected humans are dead-end hosts for several reasons. Many arthropod vectors competent to transmit a zoonotic arbovirus prefer nonhuman hosts as a blood source, reducing the likelihood of transmission from human to vector. Also, infected humans are usually not sufficiently permissive to experience a high titer viremia, so they cannot serve as effective links in the transmission cycle. There are only a few exceptions: in urban settings, dengue, urban yellow fever, Oropouche, and Chikungunya viruses can be maintained by an arthropod vector-human cycle.",37.37476129812707,14.3855887762601

These viruses are transmitted by mosquitos among bird populations, which may act as the vector for transmission between humans and avian species. Ockelbo virus, therefore, is apparently maintained in an enzootic cycle involving birds and mosquitos with transmission to other hosts such as humans. Antibodies to Ockelbo virus, either experimentally or naturally infected, have been detected in Passeriformes, Galliformes, and Anseriformes (Lundstrom et al., 1992; Lundstrom and Niklasson, 1996) . Viremia in the absence of disease resulting from infection with Ockelbo has also been demonstrated in these bird groups.

In agreement, the emergence of the 2019-nCoV highlights the importance of bats as a reservoir for new viruses capable of infecting humans, but also serves as an excellent model to design studies and strategies to prevent future emergence of new zoonotic agents. In this regard, it is important to increase the efforts aimed at the characterization of the virome of different animals to study the viral evolution and adaptation to their natural hosts (Holmes, Rambaut and Andersen 2018) .

Although it is known that viruses evolve under constraints and adapt to hosts on transmission, the perspective we offer casts viruses and their genetic relationships to each other as being primarily conditioned by hosts they infect. Their own genetic history that is emphasized so much in virus-centric accounts of their evolution over short periods is quite subservient to the shaping forces of host-driven evolution. Similarly, although existing accounts of virus sequence change are so much focused on their seemingly unlimited evolutionary potential and adaptability, the range of viruses that are able to successfully infect and maintain transmission in their hosts appears limited and is more a function of the host niches a virus can exploit 65 . For example, the wide range of viruses that infect humans possess specific tissue tropisms, pathologies and transmission routes. However, homologues of these viruses in other mammalian species typically reproduce very closely, and appear restricted by, these same virushost interactions. As further evidence of host-induced constraints, virus replication ability, transmissibility and successful establishment of zoonoses are predicated, Viruses remain associated and highly adapted to their host, even as the hosts themselves evolve and speciate over long periods (tens of millions or potentially hundreds of millions of years). Viruses continue to infect cells in each host lineage, but they themselves must evolve in concert with their host to retain fitness and host adaptation as the niche they occupy gradually changes. After a prolonged period of co-evolution, viruses acquire very different virus 'shapes' and a phylogeny that resembles in part that of their host.

The most recent pandemics were caused by viruses that were transmitted from animal reservoirs to humans, such as influenza A viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. Adaptation of the virus to the new host is often cited as the cause of such emergence. • Distinguishing the genetic changes that are due to adaptation from those that are due to random events is hard in any biological context; virus host jumps are no exception. We present four different mechanisms by which viruses may emerge in a new host. Although all four mechanisms could produce the same genetic pattern in new hosts, only two are due to adaptation. We illustrate which data need to be collected to distinguish between the four mechanisms. • Future risk of viral host jumps to humans could be assessed by genetic surveillance of viruses in reservoir hosts, but only when genetic adaptation is required for a host jump and when precursors of this adaptation can be detected. • bioinformatic analyses of surveillance data are key stepping stones for identifying putative genetic markers of viral adaptation from enormous pools of genetic data. Confirmation of which of these putative markers are due to adaptation requires experimental validation by using reverse genetics and host models from reservoir and new host species, and corroborating results with epidemiological and ecological data. • our review of the current literature on four well-studied viral host jumps shows that research on host-jump processes unfolds in four broad stages: virus sample collection and genetic analysis; experiments in vitro or in cell culture; in vivo experiments in model hosts; and in vivo experiments in natural hosts. We evaluate the issues in using these types of data for validating adaptive hypotheses, and identify opportunities to collect further data that would enable better discrimination among emergence mechanisms. • A detailed understanding of viral host jumps and the assessment of future risk requires multidisciplinary research efforts with input from field ecologists, microbiologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians and evolutionary biologists, and the use of use of diverse approaches (field sampling, laboratory experiments, data analysis and mathematical modelling).

Selective pressures acting at the intra-host and inter-hosts levels can differ and often act in opposite directions. Frequently, these selective pressures conflict between the need to adapt to the host and the ability for transmission to other hosts. Those variants that are favored by selection within hostsmutations for evading the immune system and drug resistancemay diminish the capacity for transmission of the virus and, in consequence, will be selected against at the inter-host level. In addition, every transmission event represents a bottleneck that reduces drastically the population size of the virus and, consequently, also its genetic diversity. This leads to slower evolutionary rates at the inter-host level. For instance, in HIV there seems to be an inverse relationship between transmission and evolutionary rate (Berry et al. 2007 ). We must also consider how and by which means is the virus transmitted. Transmission rates are higher in air-transmitted virus, such as influenza A, than in those that use the sexual route. Similarly, those viruses that use arthropod species as vectors have lower rates of evolution, a cost associated to their need for replication in different hosts (Holmes 2004; Woelk and Holmes 2002) .",35.41271431127576,12.710824176001406

Most UMRV originate from bats (Figure 3) , which is consistent with the prominent role of chiropteran hosts in paramyxovirus evolution and spread [70 ] . Detection of genetically closely related viruses in members of different mammalian orders is in keeping with a low degree of species specificity of at least some of these viruses [71] . The recent descriptions of feline paramyxoviruses clustering phylogenetically within the UMRV in an intermediate position between the genus Morbillivirus sensu strictu may hint at the acquisition of UMRVs by carnivore predators from small mammals. The relevance of small mammals and their carnivorous predators is consistent with their representation as morbillivirus hosts in the form of CDV, PDV and a partially characterized Brazilian vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) morbillivirus (DrMV) [70 ] . The genetic diversity of UMRV outnumbers that of morbilliviruses many fold and it is tempting to speculate that all morbilliviruses have ancestral origins in small mammals. The ecological scenario of carnivores acquiring viruses from their prey is in line with the evolutionary origins of rabies virus in chiropteran hosts followed by an introduction into canids [72] and the acquisition of SARS-coronavirus by civets from bats [73 ] . Whether carnivores function as an entry point for viruses previously restricted to small mammals to infect a wider range of mammalian hosts is unclear.

Risk factors that exist in the ''pre-spillover'' period can be environmental, demographic, or evolutionary; these can be viewed as existing along an eco-evolutionary continuum. Successful cross-species transmission is usually the result of repeated spillover events, i.e., ''viral chatter'' (Wolfe et al., 2005) . Standing pathogen diversity in reservoir populations can be critically important for promoting the evolutionary flexibility of pathogens, and likelihood of successful spillover and emergence in a new host (Morse, 1993) . Thus, the taxonomic diversity of pathogens in hosts and the genetic diversity of each respective pathogen may both be important predictors of spillover success, or emergence.

Put another way, given the same amount of exposure, are all RNA viruses equally likely to jump species boundaries? This question is at the heart of understanding the evolutionary genetics of viral emergence, and, although we are a long way from a complete answer, there is growing evidence that specific evolutionary constraints make host switching more likely in some RNA viruses than in others. An important idea in this context is that there is a general phylogenetic rule regarding the ability of a virus to jump hosts: the more phylogenetically distant the host species in question, the less likely it is that their viruses will be able to jump between them (DeFilippis & Villarreal 2000) . For example, the reservoir populations for most human viruses are other mammalian species, and while we probably eat virally infected plant matter on a regular basis we do not suffer the viruses experienced by Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004) plants (Hull et al. 2000) . On a more localized scale, studies of HIVs and SIVs suggest that the ability of these viruses to jump species to some extent reflects the phylogenetic relationships of the hosts (Charleston & Robertson 2002) , although the fact that HIV-2 jumped from sooty mangabey monkeys to humans shows that exceptions are possible (Hahn et al. 2000) . Such a phylogenetic trend is compatible with a simple evolutionary rule: the more specialized species become in one environment (in this case a particular host species), the less likely it is that they will be able to adapt to new environments (Bell 1997) . The rapid pace of RNA virus evolution means that these host specificities are likely to be established quickly, as observed in experimental systems (Turner & Elena 2000) . Testing the extent of the relationship between phylogenetic distance and the ability to jump hosts should be one of the key areas for future research into viral emergence.",33.488569983293026,13.660745611744415

Many species of bats are insectivorous while others are frugivorous and few of them are hematophagous. Some of these animals fly during the night, others are crepuscular or diurnal. Some fly long distances during seasonal migrations. Many species are colonial cave-dwelling, living in a rather small home range while others are relatively solitary. However, in spite of the importance of bats for terrestrial biotic communities and ecosystem ecology, the diversity in their biology and lifestyles remain poorly known and underappreciated. More than sixty viruses have been detected or isolated in bats; these animals are therefore involved in the natural cycles of many of them. This is the case, for instance, of rabies virus and other Lyssavirus (Family Rhabdoviridae), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Paramyxoviridae), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Coronaviridae). For these zoonotic viruses, a number of bat species are considered as important reservoir hosts, efficient disseminators or even directly responsible of the transmission. Some of these bat-borne viruses cause highly pathogenic diseases while others are of potential significance for humans and domestic or wild animals; so, bats are an important risk in human and animal public health. Moreover, some groups of viruses developed through different phylogenetic mechanisms of coevolution between viruses and bats. The fact that most of these viral infections are asymptomatic in bats has been observed since a long time but the mechanisms of the viral persistence are not clearly understood. The various bioecology of the different bat populations allows exchange of virus between migrating and non-migrating conspecific species. For a better understanding of the role of bats in the circulation of these viral zoonoses, epidemiologists must pay attention to some of their biologic properties which are not fully documented, like their extreme longevity, their diet,",34.13286902195149,13.190206715366012

Failure to cross the species barrier (spillover) aligns with ""fails in transport""; failure to sustain transmission, with a transmission potential, R 0 <1, aligns with ""fails to establish""; and interruption of sustained intra-H S transmission, an average R 0 <1, aligns with ""noninvasion"" by the nonindigenous species. Differences between disease emergence and biological invasion exist, as transitions leading to disease emergence are not strictly hierarchical. Reiteration of contact and spillover (Fig. 1, transitions 1 and 2) at sufficiently high levels can suffice for a disease to emerge, but if an invading species never moves and perishes at the site of its introduction, even if repeatedly introduced to the site, further establishment and spread, prerequisites of invasion, is precluded. In addition to biological factors which establish the setting in which zoonotic pathogens may emerge (see the chapters by Cleaveland et al. and Daszak et al., this volume) , the emergence of a zoonotic agent within human or animal populations must be detected by humans. Too often the presence of a zoonotic agent is first identified by the presence of disease in humans, and surveillance for disease emergence is largely restricted to identifying incident cases of disease in humans rather than monitoring infection or disease among wildlife H R s or H I s (see the chapters by Childs, by Merianos, and by Stallknecht, this volume). The challenges present to designing programs aiming to disrupt transmission of a zoonotic pathogen within a wildlife reservoir host population prior to spillover and disease emergence are discussed in the chapters by Childs and by Stallknecht in this volume.",40.592245350344946,16.344454560202745

The majority of the emerging viruses are zoonotic in that, they can be transmitted to humans from animals (Morens and Fauci, 2013) . Wildlife, especially mammals and birds, are hosts to a large number of viruses. Most of the mammalian hosts belong to the orders of Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primates and Carnivora. Mammals and birds play an important role as virus reservoirs within which the viruses propagate without causing disease (Mackenzie and Jeggo, 2013) . Occasionally these viruses can infect other species including humans. Zoonotic viral infections which cause human diseases may come from domestic animals, poultry, livestock and wildlife. When a virus jumps from animal to human, the phenomenon is called zoonotic spillover which potentially has serious human health and economic impacts (Wang and Crameri, 2014; Plowright et al., 2017) . The high risks of viral host switching are highlighted by the emergence of SARS coronavirus (CoV), hantaviruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Parrish et al., 2008) . Most zoonotic viruses are not readily transmitted among humans. In this context, humans can be called dead-end hosts (Causey and Edwards, 2008) .",42.03436504931627,15.959292241891049

Anthropogenic factors bring human and domestic animal populations into increasing contact with wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. For example, in Malaysia, intensive management of pig production in farms located in fruit bat habitat led to the spillover of Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus for which these bats serve as a reservoirs (Chua et al. 2000) . Similarly, logging routes carved into primary forest have provided easier access to hunters in search of animals to eat or sell. The trade in bushmeat, which brings wild animals from geographically disparate habitats into contact with each other and with people, has led to the spillover of several important zoonotic viruses including HIV, Ebola, and SARS (Hahn et al. 2000; Karesh et al. 2005; Leroy et al. 2004; Li et al. 2005) . As human populations continue to increase, so do these anthropogenic pressures on wildlife habitat and populations. The result is likely to be continued spillover of new zoonotic pathogens into human populations, and perhaps even an increase in spillover rates, reflecting increases in these anthropogenic drivers of emergence.",37.443117967507625,15.277448013366742

Studies focused on these issues have already begun. For example, studies of exposure to nonhuman primate viruses in Cameroon bushmeat hunters have revealed new spillover events (Wolfe et al. 2005a (Wolfe et al. , 2005b (Wolfe et al. , 2005c . Studies of the patterns of spillover have identified those pathogen groups most likely to move from nonhuman to human hosts (Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005) . However, to truly fuse wildlife research with medical research on emerging disease will require a greater degree of collaboration among diverse disciplines. For example, few studies have used molecular techniques to survey hunted wildlife or other zoonotic reservoirs for novel pathogens, a study which would require collaboration among molecular biologists and wildlife biologists, and veterinarians. The wildlife mortality and monitoring network established in Central Africa is one example (Rouquet et al. 2005) . Similarly, ecologists have used mathematical models to describe pathogen dynamics in wildlife (Dobson and Foufopoulos 2001; Hudson et al. 2002) , but few studies have used these approaches to predict patterns of spillover from bushmeat. Expanding collaboration in the face of new zoonotic threats (e.g., H5N1 avian influenza) is likely to increase capacity to understand these complex processes.",37.799275217369264,14.658160140385501

Increased concentrations of indicator bacteria after manure application exceeding Iowa's state bacteria water quality standards suggest that swine manure contributes to diminished water quality and may pose a risk to human health. Additionally, the occurrence of HEV and numerous bacterial pathogen genes for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus in both manure samples and in corresponding surface water following periods of manure application suggests a potential role for swine in the spreading of zoonotic pathogens to the surrounding environment.

For instance, early studies implicated the effects of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon in 1997/98 in the emergence of NiV. 119 Directly preceding these outbreaks, Malaysia experienced a severe drought resulting from the El Niño conditions (the largest and warmest to develop in the Pacific Ocean in the past century). The situation was aggravated by the excessive haze produced by the aggressive slash-and-burn deforestation activities in Indonesia. This series of environmental and human events may have affected the natural habitat of the pteropid bats, forcing their migration and subsequent encroachment into fruit orchards surrounding the pig-farming area, resulting in the unanticipated introduction of NiV from its natural host to pigs as the amplifying host. Recent investigations, however, refuted the effect of ENSO and showed evidence that NiV is frequently present in fruit bats in Malaysia, and that its spillover -from bats to pigs and subsequent transmission to human -was largely a chance event that might have occurred as a result of increased habitat encroachment and agricultural expansion by humans, confounded by the temporal and spatial dynamicity of both the virus and hosts, and the hosts (pigs) immunity against NiV infection. [119] [120] [121] In fact, similar anthropogenic drivers have been linked to outbreaks in Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India, raising concerns that these countries, which are currently experiencing promising economic growth, are still at risk of NiV re-occurrence should unrestrained deforestation and agricultural intensification activities not be closely regulated.",40.144880233750285,15.475087043137291

Aerosolized release of 100 kg of anthrax spores upwind of Washington, DC, could result in approximately 130,000-3 million deaths, a weapon as deadly as a hydrogen bomb. Other means of delivery could be food and water (food-borne and water-borne pathogens) when human exposure to waterborne infections occurs by contact with contaminated drinking water, recreational water, or food. This may result from human action, such as improper disposal of sewage wastes, or be due to weather events. Heavy rainfall and runoff influence the transport of other microbial and toxic agents from agricultural fields, human septic systems, and toxic dumpsites. Rainfall can alter the transport and dissemination of microbial pathogens (such as cryptosporidium and giardia), and temperature may affect their survival and growth. This group includes infectious diseases for which the environment (e.g., food and water) plays a significant role in a pathogen's transmission cycle. Transmission occurs between humans and the environment directly (cholera, hepatitis A, entero-viruses, noroviruses, shigellosis). These pathogens survive in the environment for long periods of time. Fomites with personal infiltration of suicidal bio-bombers in the targets or by different facilities like mail might be a mean of delivery. Even animals, like birds infected with avian influenza, might serve as vectors for infectious diseases. In vector-borne diseases, transmission occurs through contact between humans and vectors (defined here as arthropods that take pathogens from one host to another). Transmission cycles share common attributes: namely, all are affected by the population level and vector, and all are driven by a transmission potential governed by a number of biological and environmental characteristics. Environmental changes can affect population levels of the host, vector (vector survival and reproduction), or environmental stage of the pathogen (pathogen's incubation rate within the vector organism) as well as the transmission rate (vector's biting rate) at which pathogens move between hosts, vectors, and environment. Vectors, pathogens, and hosts each survive and reproduce within a range of optimal climatic conditions: temperature and precipitation are the most important, although wind and daylight duration are also important. The crossover to humans of the Nipah virus is related to a host of changes that create more favorable conditions for their spread. Often fatal Nipah virus, normally found in Asian fruit bats, is believed to have passed over to humans when bats lost their habitats due to forest fires at Sumatra and the clearance of land for palm plantations. Trying to find new food, bats came into contact with pigs, which, in turn, passed the disease to their human handlers in the late 1990s. Nipah infection causes severe encephalitis in humans, with a 40% mortality rate recorded among infected patients in Malaysia and Singapore. At least 109 people died as a result of the epidemic, and more than 1 million pigs were destroyed in an effort to control the disease. Soil can also be the medium of transmission (B. anthracis, Giardia lamblia, Burkholderia mallei, and pseudomallei, C. burnetii).",43.60514740832264,14.818994823005449

Thus, the development and use of molecular techniques to investigate waterborne outbreaks of disease have revealed that cattle can be unfairly implicated in waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis. For example, in the report detailing the infamous Milwaukee outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in 1993, cattle were listed as a potential source for the outbreak [8] . However, recent molecular analysis of samples obtained during the outbreak revealed that C. hominis was the infectious agent and cattle were not associated with the outbreak [9] . Although the development of molecular techniques has been extremely valuable, the subsequent changes to Cryptosporidium nomenclature might have also led to cattle being unfairly implicated as sources for outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in humans owing to confusion with respect to C. parvum transmission cycles. Prior to C. hominis being given species designation it was referred to as the C. parvum 'human genotype' with the current C. parvum species being referred to as the C. parvum 'bovine genotype' [10] . Based on the conclusions made from recent studies, the use of these genotype designations (human and bovine) might have created the impression that C. parvum infections in humans (previously the C. parvum 'bovine genotype') undoubtedly have a zoonotic origin, with cattle being the source [11, 12] . However, simply identifying C. parvum instead of C. hominis in human clinical samples or in environmental samples does not prove that zoonotic transmission has occurred or that cattle are the source. Humans are very capable of transmitting C. parvum to other humans, as demonstrated in swimming pool outbreaks where C. parvum has been identified [13] . Therefore, when C. parvum is identified in sporadic cases or waterborne outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis it indicates a wide range of potential sources, including humans or human sewage, as well as cattle, other livestock or wildlife.",34.6859436489984,14.233323446933987

The Rhabdoviridae viral family include the lyssaviruses, of which rabies virus is the most well known: all lyssaviruses, including rabies, likely originated from bats [6] . But the lyssaviruses are unusual among the rhabdoviruses because they do not have an insect host. Therefore, the most parsimonious hypothesis for the origin of lyssaviruses is that they themselves originated from a spillover event from an insect to a bat, because the phylogenetic relationships suggest lyssaviruses are related to all the insect-borne rhabdoviruses but are now adapted to transmit among mammalian hosts alone. Most likely this insect was eaten by a bat, though that is speculation. This might seem unlikely, but is not so: a feeding insectivorous bat may eat up to seven insects a minute. Given that mammalian viral diversity alone has been estimated to include 320,000 strains, what is the insect viral diversity given that there are an estimated 1,000 times as many insect species as mammal species? Does viral diversity scale with that? If so, there may be millions of insect viruses.

Much of the literature suggests that as we increase human population density, travel and habitat encroachment, we increase the speed of the metaphorical roulette wheel and thereby our chances of landing on the red (Figs 1A-C and 2A). We presume that with encroachment into wildlife habitats, enough human-animal contact will occur and the emergence of novel infections, while seemingly unlikely at the individual level, will become more certain. However, it is not just historical trends of infectious disease emergence from the 20 th century or intuition that suggests that increased human-animal contact will lead to increased infection spillover. Numbers support the case. E stimates of mammalian viral diversity suggest that the 5,486 known mammal species may host more than 320,000 different viral strains [2] . Estimates of biodiversity suggest that there are~8.7 million (AE1.3 million standard error) eukaryotic species on the planet [3] . Each species likely has its own set of viruses. Even bacteria are infected with their own viruses: the phages. While many of these viruses are not able to cause human disease, the numbers all suggest that, with more than seven billion humans on the planet, spillover events will continue to occur, and perhaps increase. So how do we reduce them? I suggest that we need to consider new approaches that build on the ""One Health"" paradigm and that are much more in line with conservationist philosophy. Let us return to Ebola. There is substantial data to suggest that bats are the reservoir hosts of this and related viruses [4] . There is also considerable evidence that bats are the hosts for a wide range of other RNA viruses from coronaviruses, hantaviruses, pegiviruses, hepaciviruses, paramyxoviruses, lyssaviruses and influenza viruses. What is so special about bats? There are many possible answers that range from differences in immune function to adaptations to flight to their population dynamics. But the current answer is that we do not know, and it is likely that no single factor works in isolation. However, one hypothesis is that bats might be the recipients of many viruses themselves; that is, the animals from which we believe we are getting so many novel infections are themselves the recipients of novel infections.",39.28692131418586,15.10227956486255

Such changes include altered patterns of contact between wild and domestic animals (e.g. Nipah virus), of direct human and wild animal contact (e.g. HIV, Ebola), and changes in species abundance or diversity (e.g. Hantavirus; Lyme disease). Species diversity, including the diversity of insect vectors and pathogenic microorganisms, increases towards the equator (Guernier et al. 2004) , and Jones et al. found a correlation between the emergence of zoonotic pathogens and the diversity of mammalian wildlife species (Jones et al. 2008) . Whilst high animal host and pathogen species diversity may be associated with a high burden of infectious diseases and an increased risk of disease emergence, biodiversity loss may, perhaps counter-intuitively, be associated with increased disease transmission. Biodiversity loss directly disrupts the functioning and stability of ecosystems, producing effects that can extend well beyond the particular lost species (Hooper et al. 2012) . Changes in species abundance and diversity may favour pathogen amplification and 'spill-over' through a variety of mechanisms, including reduced predation and competition resulting in increased abundance of competent hosts, and the loss of 'buffering species' leading to increased contact between amplifying host species and compatible pathogens (Keesing et al. 2010) . Tropical regions with a rich pool of existing and potential pathogens that are increasingly connected, but also experiencing high rates of ecosystem disruption and biodiversity loss, may therefore be at a particularly high risk of disease emergence. Human pathogens occasionally re-emerge as a result of dynamics that are beyond the control of humans. For example the Hantavirus outbreaks in the Southwestern U. S. in 1991-1992 and 1997-1998 have been attributed to changes in the abundance of infected rodents following periods of heavy snow and rainfall and vegetation growth leading to abundant production of rodent food. However, many ecological disturbances resulting in an EID seem to originate in the direct actions of humans. A wide range of anthropogenic factors have been linked to infectious disease emergence, including changes in land-use, travel, trade, and demographics. Notably, most of these associations are speculative and supported (Wolfe et al. 2007 ). Stage 1: The pathogen is still exclusively infecting animals. Stage 2: The pathogen has been transmitted from animals to humans under natural conditions but not yet from human to human. Stage 3: There is limited transmission from animals to humans and between humans. These are often severe and lethal diseases due to for instance filoviruses (e.g. Ebola). Stage 4: Animal disease that have sustained transmission between humans (e.g. influenza). Stage 5: A microbe that exclusively infects humans (e.g. measles, syphilis) by little hard data because ecological and biological systems are highly complex and multi-layered (Woolhouse 2011) . Demonstrating or predicting the impact of particular conditions or events on the functioning of a system is difficult, with further inference of the impact of any changes on the risk of pathogen emergence posing a formidable challenge.",34.58769749342328,12.746504534028459

Viruses, especially RNA viruses, are of greatest of concern, because of their ability to rapidly evolve to gain virulence and adapt to new hosts. 4 Ecologically, certain wildlife taxa are of more concern than others. For example, because bats are an ancient vertebrate from wildlife sources that would inform capacity-building for EID mitigation, control, and prevention. Led by the University of California, Davis, One Health Institute (in the School of Veterinary Medicine), PREDICT was initially implemented in 20 countries in Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America by a consortium of organizations including EcoHealth Alliance, Metabiota, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Wildlife Conservation Society ( Fig.  19 .2). PREDICT's objectives were to: (1) conduct wildlife surveillance and virus discovery in EID ""hotspots"" characterized by high wildlife diversity and increasing human pressure on natural resources; (2) characterize high-risk human-animal interfaces, behaviors, and drivers of pathogen spillover from wildlife to people; (3) improve virus detection and discovery by developing laboratory and disease outbreak response capacities; (4) optimize predictive models for zoonotic disease emergence and spread; and (5) deploy cutting-edge information management and communication tools to advance a more integrated, global approach to sharing data from zoonotic virus surveillance. As well, the PREDICT Consortium was wholly committed to limiting potential harm to wildlife populations by implementing live-capture protocols only and by expressing a conservation ethic in all activities, especially communications with stakeholders. For example, when discussing bats as hosts of potential zoonoses, PREDICT teams always coupled these messages with an explanation of the importance of bats to ecosystems, agriculture, and biodiversity. Also, in order to discourage bat depopulation, messages emphasized that killing bats would likely result in increased risk for viral transmission due to dispersal of disturbed populations and increases in reproductive rates to compensate for mortality. live in markets for human consumption. This unfortunately triggered large-scale extermination of civets in a misguided attempt to curb the outbreak, as it was later determined that SARS-like coronaviruses (Co-V) were endemic in wild bats, with civets and humans as spillover hosts. 14",56.90493635028054,21.472052044583435

Therefore, a risk-based approach to viral surveillance was utilized. PREDICT country-based teams worked with governmental and nongovernmental partners to identify sites where human activities were resulting in a high level of contact between wildlife and people. Sampling also took place at sites where there were extensive anthropogenic impacts on habitats and landscapes (e.g., not in pristine habitats) adjacent to human communities deemed vulnerable to zoonoses due to a lack of infrastructure for quality food storage, safe hygiene, or accessible health care. Field personnel then conducted sampling specifically at these high-risk human-wildlife interfaces and focused their sampling on the specific taxa-primates, rodents, and bats-for which there was a preponderance of scientific evidence for their Among hundreds of viral discoveries, many have implications as potential sources of pandemics of wildlife origin. For example, PREDICT effectively doubled the known number of viruses in the family Coronaviridae that includes SARS and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (see Chapter 42). Novel retroviruses and paramyxoviruses were also detected, including the detection of novel henipaviruses (the same viral family that contains Nipah and Hendra viruses) and filovirus exposure in bats. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] As well, PREDICT researchers found strong evidence for western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) as the nonhuman primate reservoir for Human T-lymphotropic virus in western Africa, and discovered a new simian immunodeficiency virus strain in a naturally infected chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) with AIDS-like symptoms. 25, 26 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was found to be circulating among gorillas and chimpanzees and among subspecies of chimpanzees, refuting the previously held assumption that HBV genotypes are host-specific, with implications for the potential for spillover in this group of viruses. 27 Furthermore, PREDICT documented anthropozoonoses-human to primate transmission of viruses-including a human metapneumovirus that caused fatal respiratory disease in wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) and human herpes simplex-1 virus that caused classic stomatitis in confiscated eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri). 28, 29 New Models for Emergence PREDICT built upon the original ""hotspots"" model to further assess patterns of wildlife disease emergence in time and space, confirming that the risk of EIDs is highest in areas of high mammalian biodiversity, and finding that mammal diversity, land use type, and land use change are the most important factors for predicting wildlife EIDs. 3, 30 As well, PREDICT searched all published data available through 2010 to identify animal hosts, human activities, and high-risk disease transmission interfaces implicated in zoonotic virus spillover. Network analyses were used to examine these data for transmission pathways, viral traits, host species characteristics, taxonomic ranges, and geographic distributions of zoonotic viruses, to provide fresh insight on the virus characteristics and conditions that pose a risk for future wildlife EIDs. 16 ",50.3862380212492,18.723297890929494

The detected seroprevalence rates of most pathogens were relatively low, except that of PPV. The high seroprevalence of PPV suggests an endemic status of this virus in our wild boar populations. As PPV is widespread in European wild boars and domestic pigs, no risk emanates from wild boars at present. Independently of this assessment, wild boars may generally act as a reservoir for pathogens and as a source of infection for domestic pigs. However, it is important to recognise that virus transmission between wildlife and domestic animals is not a oneway street. For example, wild boars may also become infected indirectly or directly through infected pigs. To assess the real epidemiological situation in wildlife and the risk of disease for wild boars and livestock, effective and science-based disease monitoring programmes in wild boars must be carried out, especially for economically important and notifiable agents that may affect wild boars and domestic pigs as well as humans. These surveillance programmes should not only analyse prevalences of pathogens but also include wildlife-biological parameters and management strategies as well as the molecularbiological characterization of pathogens circulating in wild boars and domestic pigs. The latter might become important for the evaluation of the epidemiological process.

The importance of such activity is obvious since a proper management of land use and animal resources is always required to avoid malnutrition and famine in developing countries or in countries where intensive farming is essential for subsistence. The explosive growth rate of the world's human population complicates this picture (particularly in developing countries) so other sources of dietary consumption, such as farmed fi sh, will be more demanded in the near future. Inevitably, the intensive farming of animal species leads to the onset of diseases mainly caused by propagation of infectious pathogens, affecting animal welfare, reducing productivity, and in the worst cases, seriously undermining the economy of nations.

The rise of emerging infectious diseases demonstrates the dynamic relationship among pathogens, hosts, and their environment [203239]. Over sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and over seventy percent of those zoonoses have a wildlife origin [20], including highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), sylvatic plague, Lyme disease, anthrax, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). These diseases increase burdens on public health systems, negatively impact the world economy, cause declines and extinctions of animal species, and increase loss of ecological integrity [823]. The potential global impact of a wildlife-associated pathogen on human health is exemplified by the over 35 million people currently infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is reported to have originated from a simian (primate) virus [13]. Likewise, negative effects of emerging and resurging diseases on agriculture, food safety and security, wildlife health, and human health in Southeast Asia have resulted from outbreaks of HPAI [162940]. There are also several newly described pathogens and diseases that have resulted in wildlife population declines and global extinctions. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a cutaneous fungal infection of amphibians, is linked to global declines of amphibian populations [22], and Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the etiologic agent of white-nose syndrome, has caused precipitous declines in the abundance of North American hibernating bat species [3]. Such large-scale losses of animal species and biodiversity subsequently jeopardize the ecosystems on which all life depends [718]. Of particular concern are novel emerging infectious diseases of wildlife origin as they are difficult to anticipate, devastating to wildlife populations, challenging to manage, and have the potential to have ecological ripple effects. Emerging diseases and pathogens of wildlife origin are increasing globally at alarming rates, in both incidence and by geographic location, which can be largely attributed to the driving forces of globalization, an increasing human population, and climate change [8202348].",35.50044609426727,15.85016563397392

The determinants of parasite diversity in wildlife may be linked to their biogeography (e.g., latitude, distribution area), ecology (e.g., density, migration), life-history traits (e.g., longevity and fecundity) or immunity (e.g., white blood cell counts, spleen size, immune gene diversity) (Morand and Poulin, 2000; Wegner et al., 2003; Nunn et al., 2003b; Guernier et al., 2004; Ezenwa, 2004; Bordes et al., 2007; Šimková et al., 2008; Pedersen and Grieves, 2008; Turmelle and Olival, 2009; Bordes and Morand, 2011; Nunn, 2012; Luis et al., 2013). Some of these determinants can also influence the probability of contact of bats with humans and thus the potential risk of contamination and transmission; a widely distributed bat species living at high density has a greater probability of repeated contacts with humans than a species living in low density with a restricted distribution. This may be particularly true for synanthropic species that appear to be generalist in their ecology and rich in the parasite diversity they harbour (Herbreteau et al., 2012). Finally, a question rarely investigated about species richness is: “is there any correlation between microparasite (viruses, parasitic bacteria, protists, fungi) richness and macroparasite (helminths and arthropods) richness in bats?” (Bordes et al., 2008; Turmelle and Olival, 2009).

Opportunities to implement a One Health approach are enhanced by the availability of new technologies and methodologies, including surveillance tools, diagnostics, and vaccines that have been developed through applied research [32]. For example, the development of new laboratory technologies and computational methods has facilitated major advances in our ability to detect and characterize emerging contaminants and pathogens and to define disease risks. Specifically, advances in molecular biology have opened new avenues for the identification and detection of pathogens [47], and spatially referenced database applications allow for risk assessments that can assist in spatial and temporal targeted disease surveillance in accordance with anticipated disease threats. However, just as health interventions are often single-sector focused, disease surveillance systems may be equally limited. There are instances of major threats to human or domestic animal health that were unrecognized due to the lack of integration of environmental, wildlife, domestic animal, and public heath surveillance data [43]. For example, there were delays in recognizing that human cases of encephalitis and concurrent mortalities of crows in New York, United States in 1999 shared the West Nile virus as a common etiology due to the absence of an established communication protocol between the public health and wildlife health sectors [31]. Additionally, there is often insufficient surveillance in wildlife populations, thereby delaying the identification of and response to a disease event, consequently resulting in increased negative effects on wildlife and domestic animals. For example, a recent outbreak of Peste de Petits Ruminants in saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica mongolica) from Mongolia went unrecognized for several months, resulting in loss of approximately 50% of the population (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO], Italy). Surveillance in wildlife populations not only can protect wildlife from disease but also can provide early detection and rapid responses to domestic animal and public health threats, as a consequence of upstream surveillance (Fig. 2).",37.844647304463976,13.806952793585268

The majority of bat species are frugivorous or insectivorous. In addition, three bat species, all found in Central and South America, are hematophagous (vampire bats). These dietary habits affect rabies transmission risks as described above. Depletion of environmental resources and urban expansion into bat habitats can deplete natural food sources. When their natural food sources are scarce, vampire bats will switch preferences and feed on humans and domestic animals (14). Frugivorous bats often leave behind half-eaten fruits that may be contaminated with viral particles from their saliva; if the viral levels are high enough, an animal may develop infection following consumption of these fruits. It is hypothesized that the consumption of half-eaten fruits may have caused the transmission of NiV from fruit bats to pigs and humans, as well as sharing of the raw date palm sap from the tree collectors (67, 68, 76, 77). Similarly, insectivorous bats will discard contaminated insect parts, which can then be consumed by foraging animals (107), although mechanisms for such route of pathogen transmission from insectivorous bats has not been corroborated to date. Omnivorous bats, such as Phyllostomidae, will consume nectar, plants, arthropods, and small vertebrates as food sources as necessary. This ability to utilize a wide variety of food sources may lead to increased biodiversity in a small area, enhancing the opportunities for multiple species to interact and share infectious pathogens. Environmental factors can shape pathogen transmission and spillover into a new species as well; periods of resource limitation may bring together diverse species. During the dry season, primates and bats may come into closer contact as they search for limited food supplies, enhancing opportunities for cross-species transmission of filoviruses (107).",54.364278578480686,20.84952520360769

Infectivity experiments were undertaken with HeLa cells expressing or not expressing ACE2 from humans, bats, civets, pigs and mice, and the results confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 virus was able to use entry receptors on all ACE2-expressing cells other than mice5.

These increased contacts may enhance the likelihood of diseases to affect humans, domestic animals and livestock.34 Similarly, in areas where food production is challenging and poverty is rife, wildlife, including, fruit bats and primates are hunted for subsistence or commercial purposes.35 This activity greatly amplifies human exposure to potentially deadly pathogens, as viruses harbored by these animals can easily spread via bites or scratches when handling the animals or through blood and body fluids when butchering their carcasses for consumption.36 Indeed, most EVD outbreaks to date have been linked to handling of carcasses of bats and NHPs in impoverished rural areas with limited food supplies. There is certainly little doubt that as the African population increases, anthropogenic activities will continue to expand into animal-occupied territories, which will lead to increased interaction between humans and wildlife. This underscores the dire need to increase efforts to raise awareness among rural communities about the potential risks of contracting pernicious infections from certain species of wildlife.",48.67059325838604,17.821610822666003

New housing in the outskirts of big cities can potentially be meeting points for new and already known zoonotic diseases. Of 335 emerging infectious diseases, which have been recognized between 1940 and 2004, more than 60% have been zoonotic diseases (55). Living in close contact to domesticated animals and hunt for ‘bush-meat’ can also be risk factors for an infectious disease to make the jump from the animal host to humans. Major deforestation creates closer contact between humans and bats and even primates, who can potentially be host for ‘new’ viruses. A better understanding, surveillance, and prevention of zoonotic diseases would be of great value, to both prevent and manage this upcoming threat for global health. Hot spots for this transmission have been found and they often correlate where the process of urbanization is on the clear rise (56). Even if it is not always the urban population who is at the front of new encounters with wildlife, it can still have an effect on urban health.

This includes occupational zoonoses, and can lead to underestimation of the real burden of disease attributable to biological risk in agriculture. Agriculture represents a good model to explain this trend. In fact, the agricultural sector is characterized by small size and family-run enterprises. This leads to a difficult evaluation of the exposures and a lack of health surveillance of the workers. The experience of our center, the International Center For Rural Health, fully supports this claim. For example, a case of ""Milker's Nodule"" was observed in a young cow milker. The man came to our attention through a medical examination performed as part of a program of periodical health surveillance at the workplace. During the patient's examination, a 1 × 1 cm papule at the 4th finger of the right hand, characterized by light rose-yellowish color, surrounded by an erythematous area was noticed. The patient told us that he and his colleagues had already suffered from the same symptom several times, and was well aware that the disease comes from cows. Therefore, after a consultation with the veterinarian in charge of the breeding farm, we knew that an epidemic of the cow parapox infection was present at the farm. In collaboration with the veterinarian, we diagnosed the parapox virus lesion (""Cow Milker's Nodule) (Fig. 1). The lesion disappeared spontaneously, as anticipated, but the preventive intervention by us and the veterinarian avoided any further infection in animals and/or workers. This example shows that some zoonotic diseases can actually be transmitted from animals to workers, and vice versa, and that the abililty to detect early signals is fundamental in prevention. In this case, the signal was not detected early [22].",25.134953256915498,10.11534365739889

In this 56 study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale 57 surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred 58 between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent 59 contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV 60 host-switching.

Our findings have provided evidence that even highly 63 host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an 64 increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats.

We are able to consider here the immune genotype of pathogens and hosts simultaneously, which allows us to move beyond pathogen genetic similarity to consider actual infection patterns. One major difference with previous strain theory is that modularity and associated coexistence in our model are only transient and not accompanied by stable or metastable population dynamics.

Water is ubiquitous in most ecosystems, and, among invertebrates, terrestrial haematophagous leeches are abundant and can be easily collected in many tropical rainforests [3, 4] . Such non-invasive nucleic acid sources can mitigate difficulties of obtaining wildlife samples, particularly in remote areas or for rare species. Recently, eDNA/iDNA sources have been applied to monitoring specific wildlife pathogens [5, 6] . However, previous studies have focused on known pathogens, whereas most wildlife pathogens are uncharacterized and unknown. Non-invasive approaches to monitoring known and novel pathogens may be of particular benefit in ecosystems prone to viral emergence, many of which occur in areas where invasive sampling is challenging, such as tropical rainforests. Here, we show that both eDNA from natural waterholes, and iDNA from terrestrial haematophagous leeches, can be used to detect unknown viruses circulating in mammalian hosts (Figure 1 ). Using a curated set of RNA oligonucleotides based on the ViroChip microarray assay [7] as baits in a hybridization capture system, multiple mammalian RNA and DNA viruses were detected from both eDNA and iDNA samples. Congruence was found between host DNA assignment and viruses identified in leeches, and between animals observed visiting the waterholes and the viruses detected. Our results demonstrate that eDNA/iDNA samples may represent an effective non-invasive resource for studying wildlife viral diversity. Several of the detected viruses were novel, highlighting the potential of eDNA/iDNA for epidemiological analysis of emerging viruses prior to their emergence.",32.32886798821629,12.025881384064348

However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or ""species"", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts.

Similarly, if interstate introductions are not curtailed in the U.S. with improved surveillance measures, more robust diagnostic capabilities, and proper clinical care, quelling local transmission within states will be a Sisyphean task. We therefore propose that a unified effort to detect and prevent new COVID-19 cases will be essential for mitigating the risk of future domestic outbreaks. This effort must ensure that states have sufficient personal protective equipment, sample collection materials, and testing reagents, as these supplies enable effective surveillance. Finally, stateand local-level policymakers must recognize that the health and well-being of their constituents are contingent on that of the nation.

OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All 24 three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE 25 acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity 26 towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to 27 humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced 28 evolution-population d ynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site 29 mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations 30 selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation 31 of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site 32 substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to 33 optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor 34 usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among 35 CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs).

These observations are consistent with several possibilities. First, a history of high social status (i.e., low social adversity) could confer increased plasticity in response to environmental change (e.g., subsequent losses of status). Second, historical exposure to social subordination-induced stress could blunt responses to future high-quality environments.

Without sufficient herd immunity, the Covid-19 epidemic will revert to its original dynamic course as soon as interventions are withdrawn. 3 This resurgence can only be prevented if most countries in the world follow China's example and jointly maintain intensive control for a long time, probably years, until the very last cases have been tracked down and isolated. Furthermore, countries with residual circulating virus would have to be completely isolated to avoid reintroduction. Still, prolonged intensive control could be a means to gain time until the development and large-scale availability of a vaccine. However, the amount of time this will take is unpredictable. An alternative approach is to develop herd immunity through natural infection while keeping the number of cases within the limits of the health care system. Until recently, the UK has advocated this approach, 4 but it was heavily criticized for obvious reasons: it will be practically impossible to perfectly tune actual interventions without exceeding or undershooting health care capacity. Clearly, there is a need for an exit strategy that is predictable and controllable. We believe that we have found such a strategy.",15.387271661966986,6.928073514296096

Perhaps the most important one has to do with the inability of current large-scale epidemiological models to fully account for behavioral changes in the population when a disease is evolving. As it is the case for the spreading of COVID-19, the information −and more often than desired, misinformation− travels faster than the disease. This produces undesired effects such as a collapse in the emergency rooms at hospitals, a proliferation of information sources that do not provide sensible advices in all cases, anticipated economic loses and, in general, uncoordinated responses. Therefore, it is a pressing challenge to develop more realistic ways to incorporate in models like the one employed here all these risk-averse responses and reactions. Another limitation of the current study includes the relatively low spatial resolution, which is essentially determined by the data availability. The results however indicate that the level of granularity used here is enough to capture mobility patterns and the effects of possible interventions. Finally, we have not considered the temporal and spatial variability of disease parameters, nor other potentially important characteristics of the host population such as the existence of super spreaders or the age structure, which seems to play a relevant role for this disease, at least in what concerns the case fatality rate. We plan to investigate on all these issues in the near future.",14.222802988587915,6.611399671598955

In particular, chemokines are released following viral infection, which leads to the invasion of neutrophils and macrophages and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, replication in the lower airways and exposure of endothelial cells may further amplify the inflammatory response 32 . Collectively, this leads to extensive tissue damage and depletion of epithelial cells, which may be connected to lethality 41 . Within the alveolar tissue, and systemically, the feedback between viral load, adaptive and innate immune response and tissue damage is clearly a complex system. By utilizing a multi-scale framework to implement these interactions, we aim to connect circulating biomarkers, putative treatments, and clinically observed disease progression to pathophysiological changes at the cell and tissue level.",16.01859431934067,6.123913283299386
