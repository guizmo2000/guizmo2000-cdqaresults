Filters are microporous membranes, impingers capture on to the surface of a nutrient agar plate for subsequent colony counts, and impactors capture on a solid surface for subsequent elution, as do dry cyclones. Wet cyclones capture by vortexing into a liquid phase. Aerosol particles may also be separated into size classes with multi-stage devices. For existing devices, capture efficiency falls off rapidly with particle size and there is considerable variability in performance [16] [17] [18] . All of these devices require pumping against some resistance. Different apparent microbial communities were found from the use of different air sampling techniques [11, 13] .

Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to visualize, analyze and understand the distribution of infectious diseases over space and time, thereby revealing spatiotemporal trends, patterns and associations between the pathological factors and the geographic environments of the disease [26, 27] . Exploiting the analytical, modelling and simulation features of GIS has improved epidemiological outbreak investigation and response, in which recognizing the spatial spread and transmission dynamics of an emerging infectious disease is essential for advising on efficient disease control and prevention measures [28] . However, since the first reported case of MERS-CoV in 2012, there has been a paucity of studies addressing the spatial dimension of the distribution of this disease. With the use of ecological modelling in a GIS environment [29], a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors (bioclimatic variables). This suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role. However, the effects of environmental risk factors on disease transmission were not explicitly determined. A geo-additive regression model was also utilized to examine the risk factor levels of individuals for MERS-CoV mortality in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2015 [30], and significant spatial variation and clustering with a lower risk were found in Riyadh, Arar, Aljouf and Jizan, whereas a higher risk was observed in Qassim province. However, the spatial analysis lacked detail at the governorate and city levels. The application of an iterative empirical process in a GIS environment revealed that high-camel-density areas, camel convergence points (camel markets, barns, breeding sites and slaughterhouses), former MERS-CoV cases and high seroprevalence rates were the potential risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots in Kenya [31].

Early work suggested that neutralizing antibodies against homologous PRRSV could be found as early as 9-11 days after inoculation [85]. However, this was likely the non-affinity matured immunoglobulin (Ig)M response, as anti-swine IgM ablated the previously observed neutralizing activity.

Convalescent serum also reversed thinning of the cortical plate (CP) and ventricular zone (VZ)/subventricular zone (SVZ) observed in the brains of ZIKV-infected fetal mice. Therefore, the use of convalescent serum for the treatment of ZIKV-infected pregnant women and whether it can protect against brain abnormalities in fetuses should be assessed. A study by Wang S. et al.

However, tests that evaluate the functionality of the antibodies such as the FFN are needed to determine if the detected immune response could be helpful in providing protection to nursing piglets. Neutralizing antibodies may be protective through actions including blocking uptake of the virus into cells, preventing virus binding to receptors on cells, preventing uncoating of the virus genomes in endosomes and/or causing aggregation of virus particles. For enveloped viruses, such as PEDV, lysis of the virus may also occur when antiviral antibodies and serum complement disrupt the viral membrane. For these reasons, an FFN-based virus neutralization assay was developed to assess levels of PEDV neutralizing antibodies in serum, milk or colostrum samples. The FFN provides a more rapid determination of neutralizing antibody levels than is possible with traditional virus neutralization assays that rely on visualization of virusinduced CPE after three or more days incubation to allow for full development of PEDV CPE. The direct observation of fluorescent stained infected cells, or lack of stained infected cells in the case of virus neutralization, allows for simple endpoint determination. This feature is particularly valuable when dealing with a fastidious, trypsin-dependent virus such as PEDV where CPE-based endpoints may not be obvious or may be confused with trypsin-induced CPE in the cell monolayer. Although neutralizing antibodies present in the serum would not be expected to provide direct protection from a strictly enteric infection such as PEDV, our data suggest a correlation between detectable neutralizing antibody levels in the serum and those present in milk and colostrum of previously exposed or vaccinated sows.",29.67947442129911,14.702234315658423

In the present study, recombinant nonstructural proteins expressed in Escherichia coli antigen-based protein microarray was evaluated for the first time in the serological diagnosis of IB [4] . Protein microarrays have high sensitivity and good reproducibility in quantitative and qualitative assays, and they are a valuable asset when analyzing complex biological samples [16] . In clinical sample testing, many factors, including time, cost, accuracy, sensitivity, and throughput, determine the performance and usefulness of an immunoassay. In this study, a new solidly supported material, iPDMS membrane, which has a near ""zero"" background for identification, was used. It achieved high sensitivity in detecting antibodies in serum [17] . These unique features of iPDMS not only simplify data analysis but also reduce nonspecific interactions [18] . ELISA detection has been widely used in the detection of IBV antibodies in early infection and continuous infection of IB and vaccine-immune, and no diagnosis method is more sensitive and quicker than ELISA. In this study, two microarray methods (CIT and RDT) were established. Except for the method of the observation, the reaction processes of the two methods are akin to the detection process of ELISA. However, unlike ELISA, the established methods only require 2 ng of antigen coating on each spot, and the amount of HRP-IgG required for each reaction well is only 5 ng. The antigen and HRP-IgG used in both methods were less than those used in ELISA, thereby reducing the cost of detection. In addition, the CIT can detect antibodies against IBV nsp5 quantitatively and is more sensitive than the IBV nsp5 ELISA kit. The RDT was developed to detect antibodies against IBV visually, and the results can be obtained within 15 min with great sensitivity and specificity.

Surveillance is used for early warning when disease (re-) occurs, to detect infection or disease, to measure prevalence or incidence of pathogens or hazards found in animal populations or along the food chain, to inform intervention activities to reduce or eradicate disease, and to document freedom from disease, infection or the level of chemical contaminants in food products. In a broader sense, surveillance can be considered as a scientific, factual tool that informs policy decisions and the allocation of resources for disease control [1] . This paper originates from a research project that aimed to develop a conceptual framework and practical tool for the economic evaluation of surveillance. The development of a generic economic framework independent of the pathogen, animal species, and surveillance approach or design, demands understanding of the technical relationship between the components of mitigation that impact on the economic value of surveillance. The aim was to explore the relationship between surveillance, intervention and mitigation systematically as a foundation for empirical research into the economic value of mitigation.",29.778629109137285,13.877962020740469

During the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, for example, the former UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food set up a committee that included two groups with expertise in mathematical modeling of disease dynamics. It is becoming increasingly important, therefore, that epidemiological models produce accurate quantitative predictions, and this in turn relies on accurate parameterization. Here, we examine the dynamical consequences of an unrealistic yet almost ubiquitous assumption embedded in such models concerning the distribution of the latent and infectious periods. In particular, we show that without greater care in model formulation, we may risk systematic biases when parameterizing models from data and may make overly optimistic policy recommendations.",32.341648104869655,13.6963113557092

Mitigation objective In Stage I, the level of risk must be perceived to be acceptable by decision-makers. The ideal risk would be zero, but in its absence an acceptable level of risk is generally defined as a situation for which no special intervention activities need to be directed at the pathogen [7] . The acceptable status may be a historically free status, freedom from disease, freedom from infection, or contamination of food products maintained below a defined threshold. Policy makers also may be aware of certain endemic pathogens, but categorise them as low priority and therefore do not tackle them. In short, the Stage I mitigation objective is to sustain the acceptable status. Additionally, compliance with international regulations to document disease freedom may facilitate access to foreign markets. B. Surveillance and intervention Surveillance information is used to document that a pathogen is not present or only in less than a specified proportion of the population, that an endemic status remains stable and to give an early warning signal if the situation is altered. Even though intervention measures are generally not needed in this stage, they are anticipated to combat a pathogen quickly when it occurs and are usually laid down in national contingency plans or equivalent regulations. If surveillance gives an alarm, response interventions will be implemented to contain the disease and prevent further spread (e.g. outbreak control). In such cases, the free status may be (temporarily) suspended until response activities effectively contain the disease. Classical intervention measures for infectious diseases include testing-and-culling, movement bans, quarantine, and emergency vaccination.",30.80010072601429,13.291153266771703

At present, such information can only be obtained by serial measurements and assessment of the reduction in FEV 1 over time. Finally, spirometry measures the end result of what may be a number of disease processes. It is known that patients vary considerably in their response to treatments, for example to inhaled corticosteroids [29] , and it is possible that there are a number of pathways by which smoking and other exposures lead to the final state of COPD.

Vietnam has a large number of LBMs reflecting the consumer preferences for live poultry. Under pressure to mitigate risks for H7N9 and other zoonotic AIs, Vietnam is considering, among other mitigation measures, temporary closures of LBMs as a policy to reduce risk of AI outbreaks. However, the efficacy of market closure is debated, particularly because little is known about how poultry traders may react, and whether trading may emerge outside formal marketplaces. Combining efforts of anthropologists, economists, sociologists, and veterinarians can be useful to elucidate the drivers behind poultry traders' reactions and better understanding the barriers to implementing risk mitigation measures. In this paper, we present results from a stakeholder survey of LBM stakeholders in Vietnam. Our qualitative data show that trading outside formal markets is very likely to occur in the event of a temporary LBM market closure. Our data show that the poultry value chain in Vietnam remains highly flexible, with traders willing and able to trade poultry in many possible locations. Our results indicate that simplification of the poultry value chain along with strict enforcement, engagement of stakeholders, and adequate communication would be a necessary prerequisite before market closure could be an effective policy.",30.008534974517204,12.826848696998379

Up to November 2014, MERS-CoV has been mainly sporadic [2] . Ongoing surveillance will allow detection of any increase in disease. Early detection of a disease peak, should one occur in the future, may enable early response, thus limiting spread and mitigating the impact. Furthermore, analyzing routine surveillance data for patterns of transmission may help to identify sustained human-to-human transmission, were it to occur. Early detection of such an event would be key to preventing a much larger outbreak. Although human infection is thought to have only originated in the Middle East, worldwide surveillance is important as camels harboring antibodies to MERS-CoV have been identified in other parts of the world, specifically Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya and Spain (Canary Islands) [38] [39] [40] . WHO has identified the detection of early human-to-human transmission and the identification of geographical risk areas as two key MERS-CoV surveillance objectives [40] . An integrated, one health approach to MERS-CoV surveillance involving communicable disease surveillance in humans and veterinary services is essential, ensuring systematic communication between the two, especially in 'hotspots' areas such as the Middle East and other areas with a significant camel population, especially where humans and camels are in close contact. Although camels have been identified as a reservoir for the virus, it is possible that there are other unidentified species asymptomatically hosting the virus.

This entails the use of surrogate end-points derived from animal data instead of the results of human trials. This approach could be considered as an alternative option when large efficacy studies on humans, which are usually requested for traditional regulatory approval, are virtually impossible to realize [57] . For example, if human antibodies against CHIKV developed from individuals vaccinated in phase 1 and 2 trials are transferred to NHPs and are demonstrated to confer protection, this could provide surrogate evidence of vaccine efficacy, leading to a provisional license [58] . In this regard, the level of neutralizing antibodies has been already proposed for use as a surrogate marker of vaccine-induced protection [10, 36, 49, 58] . Although there is strong evidence that neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV protect against infection and disease, the lack of compete understanding of chronic arthritis, and its determinants, could limit the ability to relate animal efficacy to human protection. Further work to model arthralgia and arthritis in NHPs could greatly enhance the value of preclinical CHIKF vaccine testing.

Establishing a surveillance system for a new epidemic is believed to be a core intervention in controlling the disease (45). Surveillance system data provides reliable information for epidemiologists to identify weak chains of transmission and facilitates evidence-based decisions by policymakers both inside and outside the healthcare service. Moreover, updating and sharing interpretations of data with media, especially in earlier phase of an epidemic, will aid community engagement and participation in control activities and prevention of spreading rumors. Although, it may be too soon to compare the effectiveness of surveillance systems for COVID-19 epidemic in different countries, it seems that the Chinese surveillance system is highly effective as it ensures timely detection, recording, tracking, updating and sharing information on media for an outbreak with unknown origin and high burden of cases (4) . In a large number of countries, the initial focus of the surveillance system for CIVID-19 is examination of all suspected cases with symptoms of the disease (mostly fever) and all people with a travel history to China or visiting Chinese travelers or citizens it the previous two weeks. However, this type of screening program mainly relies on fever cases and those with direct flights from China, so it misses pre-symptomatic cases as well as infected travelers who are arriving from regions with high burden of disease via indirect flights, which could be a source of infection in COVID-19-free countries (46) . In a communicable disease outbreak, essential data are usually collected in parallel from different available information sources in the country including data of weekly outpatient visits to health care centers and hospital referrals with a chief complaint of fever, data of weekly inpatient fever cases and deaths with unknown origin (45). Furthermore, increase in the number of cases and deaths due to pneumonia may raise an alarm in COVID-19 free areas. A prerequisite for establishing a surveillance system is to provide basic laboratory facilities, particularly at ""point of care"" (10). This system should be constantly monitored and evaluated using sensitive indicators to ensure the quality of case detection, diagnosis and management. Detection of primary confirmed cases with poor prognosis in early phase of the epidemic without any link to confirmed cases from other regions emphasis on the insensitivity of a national and local surveillance systems and low performance of control activities against the disease in community level.

In Vietnam, passive surveillance is conducted through farmers or community animal health workers notifying local state vets, with subsequent diagnostic testing and investigation. Positive samples are then reported to the central government. Currently, a low number of outbreaks are reported through passive surveillance (32) due to the reliance on clinical detection of disease, testing, and reporting processes. During this study, samples were collected through active surveillance, with standardised selection criteria across regional areas within each round of sample collection. This approach enables detection of HPAI in subclinical birds and minimises temporal and spatial variation in surveillance effectiveness, enabling more robust identification of regional differences in the prevalence of H5N1 and H5N6 at the level of the LBM. The ongoing active surveillance conducted in LBM is essential to monitor changes in spatiotemporal distribution patterns and strain evolution.

VACV was used as the vaccine against smallpox during eradication efforts, but more recently, human infections of zoonotic origin have been reported [7] [8] [9] in Brazil, India [7] and Mongolia [10] . The natural history of VACV and its transmission cycle is not known, but several wild and peri-domestic species of mammals have shown evidence of orthopoxvirus infection, including horses, coatis, opossums, monkeys and rodents, which could be involved in the maintenance of the virus in nature [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In South America, the first VACV outbreak of zoonotic origin was identified in Brazil in 1999 [17] and all documented VACV outbreaks on the continent since that year have been associated with dairy farms in Brazil [18] [19] [20] [21] or Colombia [22] .

The virus could be transmitted to neighboring farms by sharing infected cattle for breeding practices and/or infected milkers. Secondary human cases of VACV without direct physical contact with infected cattle, have also been reported [17, 23] .

Multiplex RT-PCR testing analyzes a single sample for multiple viral agents and subtypes simultaneously, producing sensitive and specific results in a short period of time (58) . Even with the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) quickly modified standard PCR assays to detect the new virus (59) . A challenge to routine RT-PCR testing in all patients who present with viral symptoms is the prohibitive cost, need for specialized equipment, and the relatively longer time between sampling and availability of results (60) . Furthermore, PCRs detect viral genes that are used as a surrogate measurement of whole virions. In some instances, viral gene detection may actually reflect non-replicating, non-infectious virions. Newer rapid point-of-care PCRs are currently being developed, but their implications for clinical decision making remain uncertain (61) . In addition, rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are also available commercially for detection of both RSV and influenza virus infection in the outpatient and emergency department settings (62, 63) . However, in a recent study by Moesker et al., RADTs were found to have relatively low sensitivity compared to RT-PCR testing which limits their use for clinical decision making (64) . Nonetheless, RADT maybe a valuable tool, especially during an outbreak, because it is a point-of-care test that is easy to use with a rapid turnaround time (65) . Since clinical symptoms for different viral respiratory infections are often the same, and with the limitations of our current testing methods, it is critical that clinicians obtain microbiology data early, especially in the risk population (66) (67) (68) (69) . There is also a large variability of disease severity in children infected with RSV or influenza A (H1N1) virus. In RSV infection, development of lower respiratory track disease in premature infants, with or without chronic neonatal lung disease is associated with a significantly higher risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death (12, [70] [71] [72] [73] . In a study of 2,147 children with lower respiratory infection due to RSV, Rodriguez et al. reported age less than 6 months, history of prematurity, chronic respiratory disease or congenital heart disease, and coinfection with adenovirus were significant predictors of increased disease severity (74) . Similar predictors exist for children infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus, including age less than 5 years, a history of chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, and immune compromise ( Table 1 ) (75) . It is therefore prudent that clinicians should conduct laboratory evaluations early in the illness for viral infections in these at-risk populations presenting with respiratory failure and ARDS.",27.722413663477067,12.51452245865626

This particular feature of IAVs allows foreign antigenic peptides to be displayed on the outer surface of the virion fused to its coat proteins and for more than two decades has been exploited in many applications including antibody or peptide display libraries, drug design, and vaccine development against infectious and non-infectious diseases. As vaccine carriers, IAVs have been shown to elicit both a cellular and humoral response against various pathogens through the display of antibody epitopes on their coat proteins. Despite their high immunogenicity, the goal of developing an effective vaccine against HIV-1 has not yet materialized. One possible limitation of previous efforts was the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which exhibited autoreactivity properties. In the past five years, however, new, more potent broadly neutralizing antibodies that do not exhibit autoreactivity properties have been isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, suggesting that vaccination strategies aimed at producing such broadly neutralizing antibodies may confer protection against infection.

It met the target time period between presentation and sampling set by the Scottish Government. It avoided significant expense of unnecessary admissions. Most importantly, it was successful in avoiding a large number of resource intensive hospital admissions for testing for SARS-CoV-2 that could have put the healthcare system at risk of exposure to COVID-19. Community sampling is an intrinsic part of the response to COVID-19 and can be carried out safely, efficiently and effectively. However, after further widening of the suspected cases definition, which accounted for an increase of geographical areas presenting risk for potential exposure abroad by HPS and PHE [5] , the Lothian team witnessed a surge of referrals. Indeed, following the case definition widening on 25 February 2020, 49 suspected cases were referred for sampling in 48 hours, compared with 79 over the 14-day period in this study (6-20 February 2020). To meet this increased demand, we adapted our model to a fixed site, or 'drive through'. This commenced on 28 February [13] . Local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland and the UK nevertheless started with as at 19 March 2,644 confirmed cases in UK [14] . One possible reason may have been the mild course of COVID-19 in a relatively large proportion of those infected [15] , so that such people unknowingly contributed to ongoing transmission. Facing the larger local spread of disease, the UK moved from applying containment to delay and mitigation measures [16] . Moreover, due to capacity reasons, testing could no longer be offered to people with minor symptoms from 12 March onwards [17] . All this may have affected the approach to community testing. Measures to increase testing capacity are nevertheless currently being taken [18] . Healthcare services, and the UK and Scottish Governments, must recognise the importance of maintaining isolation of suspected cases and avoiding unnecessary contact with healthcare settings, and direct resource into facilitating community testing as far as possible. Healthcare staff should have ongoing training in these areas, including PPE use, fit testing and community experience, in order to ensure staffing resilience in response to a HCID.",40.54307166082852,15.401203825772974

Recent outbreaks and spread of exotic or emerging diseases such as avian influenza (AI), Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) in previously unaffected territories of the EU have emphasised the need for well-developed and adequately resourced health systems, including surveillance, to ensure early detection and rapid containment, the complexities of which are highlighted by Braks et al. (2011) [7] . At the same time investment is being constrained due to significant financial budget reductions in many European countries. Livestock disease is important economically with regards to a loss of productivity, its potential impact on human and animal health, and the mitigation activities implemented when disease occurs (for example trade or movement bans, testing and culling). For example, the economic cost of BSE in the UK accrued from the value loss in infected carcasses, disposal costs, and, most importantly, the sharp drop in domestic beef demand due to consumer scares (sales of beef products declined by 40% once the possible link between BSE and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was announced, but the costs were partly offset by an increase in consumption of substitute meat), and a complete loss in export markets [8] . Further costs accrued from operating various public schemes, establishment and enforcement of new legislation and the adjustment of the industry to the new structure and markets [8] . Livestock disease can be spread directly for example the introduction of FMD from Irish calves imported to the Netherlands that were also held responsible for the infection of a farm near to the port of introduction to mainland Europe [9] . It can be spread by infected equipment, crates or transporter vehicles which can be contaminated by microbes. For example Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria were detected on the sides and floors of lorries [10] and contaminated transporters were found to be responsible for spreading classical swine fever to different farms in Lithuania [11] . By moving animals with latent or asymptomatic infections this enables disease to spread to wherever the animal travels or where the necessary vectors may be present. Particularly in the case of epidemic diseases where the reduction of time from introduction of a hazard to its detection can enable early response and thereby lead to a reduction in intervention costs to contain an outbreak [12] , effective surveillance is critical. Few surveillance systems however, are designed based on international livestock movement data, even though such data can provide information on the quantity and seasonality of livestock movements, the types of movement (for example flows from production of point of lay birds to laying units), the route the animals take and associated stopover or resting points. Surveillance for many livestock species occurs at the farm where it is the responsibility of the farmer (and veterinarian) to report notifiable diseases or at the abattoir where it is the role of the official veterinarian to inspect livestock according to Council Regulation (EC) 854/2004 [13] and report notifiable diseases to the national authorities, which in the UK is the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), which in turn must inform the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as stated in Council Regulation (EC) 178/2002 [14] .",32.352141818973465,14.330757390012906

Hemagglutination of erythrocytes, which harbor poorly defined receptor repertoires, does not well reflect binding avidity and dynamics. Current setups of solid phase binding assays (e.g. ELISAs, glycan arrays) as endpoint binding assays do not handle well the polyvalent aspects of virus binding by masking the dynamics of virus binding, even more so as precise variation of receptor density is difficult. Moreover, besides a wide range of synthetic glycans, only very few glycoproteins (mostly fetuin) are being employed in current binding studies, thus limiting studies on the effects of diversity and clustering of glycans as naturally presented on glycoproteins. NA activity assays often use soluble substrates poorly reflecting natural sialosides [5, 34] . The soluble substrate 2 0 -(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) can be used to determine the NA activity on a soluble substrate but ignores the effects of the virion context on NA activity on a receptor-coated surface (e.g. binding of the virion to the polyvalent substrate via its HA). Thus, methods that determine the dynamic effects of HA and NA activity urgently need improvement to allow integration into a model that accurately provides a quantitative description of the dynamic interaction between IAV particles and (decoy) receptors.",29.64554846648061,13.772124798370294

This is especially true across whole communities or cities. It is, therefore, difficult to gain enough insight into the interplay of the various factors to predict the development of epidemics and formulate appropriate mitigation strategies.

Some neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies binding the variable loops were identified, such as PG9, PG16 [51] , CH01-04 [14] , and PGT14 [70] target site on V2 or V3 loops of gp120; PGT121, PGT125, PGT128, and PGT135 interact with gp120 of V3 loops (Figure 2 ). PG9 and PGT 128, which rely primarily on backbone interactions with V1-V2 and V3 respectively, to form main chain strand association [71, 72] . A substantial proportion of the broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) identified in certain HIV-1 infected donors recognize glycan-dependent epitopes on HIV-1 gp120. Binding glycosylation site's neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies like monoclonal antibody PG9 and 2G12 were determined [73] and found that PG9 and 2G12 binding to dual glycans on a scaffolded glycopeptide and high-mannose glycans, respectively [74] . A number of other glycan-dependent bnAbs include PG16, PGTs 121-123, PGTs 130-131, and PGTs 142-145. With the appearance of new single-cell cloning techniques [61, 75] , the hopeful bNAbs have been greatly expanded to include the number of the quaternary specific Abs, including glycosylation and its antigen gp120 variable cycle [64, 76] . Neutralizing antibodies need to access the fragile sites in coated trimer with the AIDS virus. However, the complicated quaternary structure of the trimeric envelope spike efficiently protects functionally important domains [77] . Some researchers analyse these broadly neutralizing antibodies' crystal structures and found that they interact with gp120 by van der Waals, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges. Therefore, we can use some method by modifying antibodies to improve the interaction with gp120 and to gain more effective neutralizing antibody. At the same time, we expect that the antibodies induced by vaccines can act through allosteric effect by binding different sites of the variable loops, implying they may play a significant role in HIV-1 disease. It is now widely accepted that nonneutralizing antibodies (Non-Nabs) as well as neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) display inhibitory activities against HIV-1 replication in vitro based on different mechanisms [78] . In the RV144 Thai phase III trial, a reduced risk of infection in vaccinated individuals did not correlate with serum neutralizing activities but with high concentrations of anti-V1-V2 Non-Nabs [79] , providing additional support for a possible contribution of Non-Nab functions to protection [80] .

The second concern is related to the fact that VACV B5 protein is the primary target antigen for generating neutralizing antibodies against EEV [258] . Thus, due to the presence of a mutation in B5R, LC16m8 failed to induce either EEV-neutralizing antibodies or antibodies to B5 in humans [259] , a feature that may make LC16m8 a less efficient vaccine for protection against poxviruses.

The SEIR modelling performed for this assessment, with characteristics for a moderately virulent strain of CSF (Paderborn strain), indicated there may be an advantage to weekly OF sampling and testing for CSF. It is likely ASF and FMD would follow a similar pattern if a low virulence strain or chronic form of the disease were introduced. However, given the results of this evaluation, the potential application of OF sampling for active surveillance as a large-scale early detection system would be costly. Scenario 4. This early detection scenario does not achieve a 0.95 probability of detecting at least one infected premises prior to clinical signs for the range of test sensitivities evaluated using common industry sample submission practices. A higher number of samples submitted per barn or sampling a greater number of premises could achieve 0.95 probability of detection. The scenario presented assumed that each premises collected samples weekly and that the submissions were distributed throughout a given week to temporally space submissions. This scenario represents a lower level of sampling than scenario 3, and may still detect disease earlier than passive surveillance alone with a lower overall cost. The greatest advantage would likely be realized for diseases with moderate or mild clinical signs, which can be difficult to detect or differentiate from other diseases with clinical signs alone (i.e., CSF or FMD).

Surveillance of submissions to diagnostic laboratories will continue to be an important component of any infectious disease surveillance system because for many infectious diseases laboratory tests are the only way to make an etiologic diagnosis. In addition, etiological diagnoses can inform control procedures and response policies. However, the contribution of diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance to early detection of EIDs is compromised by the time lag between the onset of clinical signs and when an etiologic diagnosis is made and the availability of diagnostic laboratory tests to identify the infectious disease agent [9] . In addition, submission biases restrict the type and number of potentially infectious cases that are submitted to a diagnostic laboratory [10, 11] . Veterinarians play a critical role in determining which cases will be submitted for diagnostic laboratory testing. Their decisions, in combination with direction from animal owners, influence the types and amounts of samples that are assessed at the level of the diagnostic laboratory, introducing potential sampling biases that will affect disease patterns described by laboratory-based surveillance [12] .

Moreover, the neutralizing mAb was administered rapidly after infection. It is therefore possible that the application of such passive immunotherapy-stimulated antiviral immunity approaches may be limited to cases of suspicion of infection in young individuals by life-threatening viruses such as HCV or HIV. An important challenge will now be to determine whether passive mAb-based immunotherapies can also influence the immune response of chronically infected adult mice. Whatever the answer to this question, the fact that our experiments were conducted with young animals still in the period of immune system maturation raises the possibility that a possible first application of this effect might be the treatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV for two reasons: the need of novel therapies because of spontaneous resistances of certain patients to current chemotherapies and the availability of neutralizing mAbs against this virus (see introduction). During the first 12-48 months, maternally-transmitted neutralizing antibodies from immunized/vaccinated mothers protect babies and infants from various acute infections and may turn incoming viruses into effective vaccines in a process called ''natural vaccination'' [61] . However, mothers who are HIV carriers usually do not produce neutralizing antibodies and can transmit the virus to babies at birth and natural vaccination cannot take place. An important question would therefore be whether the administration of exogenous anti-HIV mAbs to perinatally infected babies could reproduce the ''natural vaccination'' observed in the case of other viral infections. The fact that, as already cited, the treatment of juvenile SIV-infected macaques with anti-SIV hyperimmune serum Igs accelerated the appearance of neutralizing antibodies and was followed by delayed onset of the disease in certain monkeys [48] provides a support to this idea.",35.162939939638825,16.035707658339835

Due to additional guarantees for transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) [30] , blood samples are annually monitored for TGE antibodies and crossreactive porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) antibodies, indicating PRCV infection has never been found in Finnish pigs. In addition, freedom from Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae has been one of the basic criteria for the national health program for elite breeding herds that started in 1983 [32] , voluntary health classification programs for conventional pig herds launched by several slaughterhouse co-operatives in the 1990s [33, 34] , and the current health classification of pig herds [35] .

Due to the emphasized importance of M. hyopneumoniae in the health classification system and knowledge about the restrictive policy concerning imports of live pigs, sampling and testing at that time were mainly conducted to rule out M. hyopneumoniae infection. Retrospectively, a higher number of H1N1 seropositive samples were found in pigs in herds with clinical signs than in samples of pigs collected for disease monitoring and in samples of pigs in special health class farms. Avian-like swine H1N1 does not necessarily cause coughing in pigs that are free from M. hyopneumoniae infection [37] , and subclinical infections are possible [38, 39] .

Molecular S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR is thus helpful in identifying bacterial pneumonia cases with the poorest prognosis who might need intensive therapies.

Respiratory viruses can be identified in asymptomatic children, and secondary bacterial infections in the lungs can easily be missed by these methods.

Linking surveillance approaches for emerging and neglected endemic zoonoses, with a renewed focus on existing disease problems in developing countries, has the potential to overcome several limitations and to achieve additional health benefits. Poor reporting is a major constraint to the surveillance of both emerging and endemic zoonoses, and several important barriers to reporting can be identified: (i) a lack of tangible benefits when reports are made; (ii) a lack of capacity to enforce regulations; (iii) poor communication among communities, institutions and sectors; and (iv) complexities of the international regulatory environment. Redirecting surveillance efforts to focus on endemic zoonoses in developing countries offers a pragmatic approach that overcomes some of these barriers and provides support in regions where surveillance capacity is currently weakest. In addition, this approach addresses immediate health and development problems, and provides an equitable and sustainable mechanism for building the culture of surveillance and the core capacities that are needed for all zoonotic pathogens, including emerging disease threats.",40.052833480089326,17.361454042650557

[23] attempted to quantify global surveillance capacities for detecting and communicating disease outbreaks. Their findings showed that in many regions outbreak detection and reporting occurs very rapidly and that the intervals between the start of an outbreak, its detection and public communication had generally decreased over time. Considering all regions globally in 2009, the median delays to detection and communication were just 13.5 and 19 days, respectively, but with considerable geographical variation [23] . Of all outbreaks considered, 53 per cent were reported from Africa, where both detection and public communication delays were longest and several delays of over 150 days were observed [23] . Spatial reporting biases have also been identified for emerging infectious diseases specifically, with reduced reporting of disease events from developing regions [24] .

However, to carry out this type of inhibition assay, it is necessary to utilize biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities. Unfortunately, this strict condition is often inconvenient and cannot be accessed by many researchers. In contrast, our pseudovirus-based inhibition assay can be performed without the requirement of BSL-3 laboratories, considerably simplifying the detection of neutralizing antibodies, as this method does not involve live viruses and is, therefore, safe to carry out [10, 23] . Moreover, we demonstrated consistency of neutralization results between the live virus-based inhibition assay and the established pseudovirus-based inhibition assay. These neutralizing results are also consistent with those obtained from the experiments on antisera of mice immunized by another RBD fragment containing residues 358-588 of MERS-CoV S protein, as reported recently [24] . The above results suggest a viable alternative for the rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV natural infection and the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines when BSL-3 facilities are not available. Furthermore, in the absence of BSL-3 facilities, the pseudovirus-based inhibition assay provides a convenient and reliable way to rapidly screen compound-or peptide-based MERS-CoV entry inhibitors to test neutralizing antibodies.

The economic cost of an avian pandemic to all countries would be phenomenal and, if allowed to last for months, become exponential [28] [29] [30] . Early detection and control of an AI pandemic will also require a coordinated international response. Controlling avian flu is for the good of global public health and all countries have an interest and obligation to do so. Firstly, the response to the influenza threat would need an integrated cross-sector approach, bringing together animal and human health, areas of rural development and agriculture, economics, finance, planning and others. Partnerships are needed at both international and national levels. Next, there is certainly a priority on curbing the disease ""at source"" in the agricultural sector, thereby reducing the probability of a human epidemic. International resources are also needed for surveillance on avian influenza outbreaks and human-tohuman transmission. It is also important to strike a balance between short and long term measures. Avian flu is becoming endemic in parts of East Asia and will require a long effort to suppress it. Meanwhile, a human pandemic may still emerge from a different strain of flu virus. Thus it makes sense for the international community to also undertake broader long-term measures to strengthen the institutional, regulatory and technical capacity of the animal health, human health and other relevant sectors in Asia. While country-level preparedness and leadership is essential for success, it must be backed by global resources. Even though the benefits of containing a pandemic are overwhelming, individual governments may still be daunted by the social, political and economic costs of various policy measures. Richer countries may have to support poorer countries in financial and non-financial means in the fight against a flu pandemic, for the sake of international good. The Global Outbreak Alert & Response Network (GOARN), a technical collaboration of existing institutions and networks who pool human and technical resources for the rapid identification, confirmation and response to disease outbreaks, is one such international body that supports global preparedness against bird flu. However, for such an organization to succeed, open communication and international cooperation is essential. Lastly, there is a critical need to share information rapidly with experts, policymakers and the worldwide community at large. Honest public communication will be critical as evidenced by China's denial of a local SARS outbreak initially which delayed early containment measures.",27.644211907491584,12.128906459368194

We can summarize our findings in line with the six aims we listed in the introduction. Regarding the technological advancements and increased data availability (i), we find that social media and big data are useful to parametrize BCMs and present an as yet insufficiently explored source of information. Social media can, however, introduce a bias in individuals' prevention-or disease-related perceptions. In addition to the health recommendations they make, policy-makers can optimize their influence by enabling the collection and accessibility of government-owned data (such as surveillance) and by establishing a quality label for disease-related websites. Further, we can confirm that behavioural immunity is often contingent on the disease (ii): BCMs are disease and situation-dependent, which we strongly support. Regarding model validation and parametrization with quantifiable observations (iii), we can state that additional data sources are needed to specify relevant BCMs. Although the 2009 influenza pandemic presented an opportunity for parametrization and validation of both disease transmission and BCMs for flu-like illnesses, there is still much room for improvement in other disease areas. Current models have, without a doubt, assessed the importance of social networks in individual decisions (iv). Individual-level models such as IBMs are extremely useful to tackle behaviour changes and to mimic disease transmission better. More specifically, (v) the diversity observed in BCMs has increased the feasibility of introducing social influences and irrational behaviour (vi).

For instance, many influenza models use vaccination as a prevention measure with individuals evaluating their previous influenza vaccination decisions to determine the current season's strategy. It would seem unrealistic to require more data to parameterize both behavioural change and disease transmission models with the aim to develop more general models that suit any infectious disease, albeit that behavioural change in response to one disease's risk perceptions could change the risk perceptions of another. At the current stage of BCM development and parametrization, generalized BCMs accommodating multiple pathogens and different transmission routes seem unrealistic.

Since SGS testing often yields a large number of backgrounds or unrelated microbial fragments, it is critical to find or identify responsible pathogens. It is first necessary to establish a knowledge database of common microorganisms for lung infections: a database of background microorganisms common to each laboratory and testing unit in SGS testing and record the number of common fragments detected. If a suspected pathogen fragment that is not in the range of common background bacteria appears in the SGS test of clinical specimens, or the number of fragments of a certain microorganism is significantly higher than the data in the background microbial database, it is included in the suspected responsible pathogen, and further methods are used for authenticating. In the alveolar lavage fluid, possible responsible bacteria, fungi, or virus fragments were detected by SGS, and the proportion of the total fragments was often extremely low, even only a few fragments, which is difficult to be diagnosed. SGS testing is often only useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary systemic infections, and when pathogens for nonclinical routine screening are detected, further use of classical pathogen detection methods is needed for diagnosis. is requires the development of a well-developed pathogen verification test system, especially for pathogenic microorganisms that are not easily detected by some common methods. Because the current SGS testing cost is still high, it cannot be widely used in the clinic, and it also affects its timeliness.

Baseline shifts like these might prevent the detection of increased illness caused by the epidemic or the bioterrorist attack. Localized population surges associated with major public events (for example, the Olympics) are also likely to reduce the ability of existing surveillance systems to detect infectious disease outbreaks.

It is often too late to take action if the disease is at the final stage. The patients' chances to live and be cured increase if the disease diagnosis is performed as early as possible [1] . There are many factors that can cause diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, disruption of the balance in the human body system, cancers, bacteria, viruses, and fungal and other microorganism infections [2] [3] [4] . During the disease process, there are certain complex changes that occur in cells ranging from the molecular integrity to cell morphology [5] . There are various schemes used to detect diseases, including the use of dye marker labelling, enzyme-base labelling assays and nucleic acid-based assays [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . All of these methods form the basis for nearly all of the pathology laboratory tests in hospitals. Certain assays use fluorescence substances to label the antibodies and antigens to quantify them. Some use the antibody to label the antigen [11] . All of these methods feature high sensitivity and specificity values; however, the procedures of conducting these tests often require trained clinical personnel and expensive equipment [12] . Furthermore, while patients are on the verge of the right treatment, these tests are time consuming, which could be a major drawback of these techniques [13] . Economically, these tests are considered expensive to be run in small laboratories, typically located in small villages; thus, there is the need send the samples to a central laboratory. This procedure takes time and causes a delay in the treatment given to the patients. In addition, any contaminants or analytical errors during the process will lead to false-negative results, placing technicians in charge of handling techniques at a disadvantage [14] .",29.605917245324587,14.822300671102253

Precedent for the use of convalescent sera during epidemics signals promise that trials of sera can be conducted even as the current Ebola epidemic rages [21] . We note that if a stockpile of effective Ab preparations against Ebola had been available early in the current outbreak, the administration of these preparations to contacts might have provided them with immediate immunity, possibly resulting in early containment of the epidemic and prevention of thousands of deaths. The fact that such preparations were not available in early 2014 reflects many factors, including cost, uncertainty about efficacy, lack of available markets, and the erroneous assessment, based on prior epidemics, that the threat would be small and localized. The suggestion has also been made that such therapies remain underdeveloped because they are unattractive to the pharmaceutical industry and to academic investigators, who may view them as not fitting with the current drug development model or not being cutting-edge science, respectively [21] . However, the fact that Ab-based therapies for Ebola are now in development, clinical trials of sera are being designed, and compassionate use of these therapies has been employed in the midst of the current emergency suggests that clinically useful preparations may be identified and available shortly. For the near horizon, it is likely that Ab-based therapies will continue to make incremental advances in the repertoire of anti-infective strategies. Such areas include infectious diseases caused by drug-resistant organisms for which conventional therapies have lost efficacy and diseases for which there is no available therapy, such as Ebola. For example, the widespread use of broad-spectrum therapy has been associated with an increase in C. difficile colitis creating an opportunity for the development of toxin-neutralizing Ab therapy [22] . For the far horizon, we are optimistic that Ab-based therapies will be widely reintroduced as anti-infective agents given their inherent advantages in being natural products with low toxicity, high specificity, and established efficacy. Continued technological advances in the form of more efficient production strategies and alternative production sources, such as expression in plants, that could lower costs, combined with new therapeutic needs and better diagnostics, will make their use more attractive.",35.109216195479654,14.123264360176988

Because this was demonstrated in most donors, it is unlikely a sampling artifact. The antigenicity of these domains is also indicated by the fact that in randomly selected serum samples from HCMV-seropositive donors we found positivity rates of .90% for AD-4 and .50% for AD-5, which identified both domains as strongly antigenic structures on gB. Comparable positivity rates among sera from HCMV infected individuals have been reported for AD-1 and AD-2, respectively, and were confirmed in the current analysis [17] . A distinct difference between AD-4/AD-5 and AD-1/AD-2 is the functional antiviral activity of the domain specific antibodies. AD-1 is bound by virus neutralizing and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies which can compete for binding to the domain [35, 58] . Affinity purified AD-1-specific IgG fractions from pooled human sera were shown to have neutralizing capacity not exceeding 50%, indicating that during natural infection a considerable proportion of competing non-neutralizing antibodies are induced [36] . The incomplete neutralizing capacity of polyclonal anti-AD-1 antibodies has been suggested to provide the virus with an effective mechanism to evade the humoral immune response. Likewise, AD-2 harbors two different antibody binding sites which are bound by neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, respectively [37] . The situation seems to be different for AD-4 and AD-5 in that almost all human monoclonal antibodies that have been obtained so far have potent virus neutralizing activity. Moreover, the affinity-purified AD-4specific polyclonal human IgG fraction had a neutralizing titer that was comparable to the monoclonal antibodies with 50% neutralization in the low nanomolar range. Thus, it seems unlikely that AD-4 induces significant concentrations of non-neutralizing antibodies that compete with neutralizing antibodies for binding to the domain.

After this period, IgM antibodies may be detected by ELISA; however, flaviviruses have strong cross-reactivity, which may generate false positive results in serological tests [4, 11] . This makes diagnosis of ZIKV infections quite a challenge, especially because the disease emerged in regions where other flaviviruses are endemic.

Paradoxically, during the natural course of HCV infection, neutralizing antibodies are rarely detectable at the early stage of the infection, and if detectable, these antibodies are essentially ineffective in vivo, in spite of their neutralizing activity being demonstrated in vitro [16] [17] . As a consequence, patients establish persistent HCV infections even in the presence of appreciable amounts of neutralizing antibodies [9] . Additionally, it has been observed that HCV variants that re-infect the grafted livers of transplant patients are poorly neutralized by antibodies that were present in pre-transplant plasma. In contrast, the viral variants that could no longer be detected following transplantation are efficiently neutralized [18] . These observations support the hypothesis that the profile of antibodies elicited by the virus over the natural course of a patient's HCV infection, in combination with the high mutation rate of the virus, determines the ultimate pattern of humoral immunity [9] . In the majority of cases the result is that virus-specific neutralizing antibody responses occur too late (or neutralizing antibodies are produced in insufficient amounts) to halt the infection. In line with this thinking, a comprehensive study of clinical samples collected after a single-source outbreak of hepatitis C has shown that neutralizing antibodies produced early in the infection play an important role in the clearance of HCV, thus avoiding chronicity [16] .",29.787049575132055,12.625722071745667

Regardless of the case, it is essential to increase the availability and quality of epidemiological data to better understand TADs transboundary spread. Current risk assessments looking into TADs spread are leading the way, in some cases extrapolating from the very limited information available. Risk assessments should focus on informal trade, which represents the widest knowledge gap. Nevertheless, information on outbreak sources and pathways is required to develop prevention, awareness and surveillance programs that correspond to the reality. In the case of formal trade, risk assessment will allow to develop additional protocols and regulations to fill in the loopholes of the system. Apart from the improvements needed in many countries and regions at the institutional level to allow a functional public veterinary system and customs (i.e. border control) to roll out proper prevention, surveillance and detection programs, the role played by farmers and the public at large will always remain the key to success. At farm level, acknowledging that the animal keeper represents the front-line of disease prevention and early detection, strong emphasis must be given to biosecurity measures (allowing the individual farm to protect itself to the best degree possible from disease introductions), and on the importance of reporting any outbreak suspicions to the authorities. This must not only be supported by adequate training opportunities for farmers and people offering farm-related services, but should ideally be reflected as core responsibility for these stakeholders within the livestock development policy framework. Since some diseases may be first manifested in wildlife, the same applies to hunters, forest rangers and others. ",32.1695490076876,15.926920551872024

The CF test is useful for the diagnosis of acute infections, as positive CF titres are often an indication of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies or very high levels of IgG. Neutralizing antibodies which are mainly IgG persist for many years and the VNT is the test of choice for seroprevalence studies [33] . Burrows (1969) [34] reported that 59% of mares had neutralizing antibody against ERAV, in contrast to 10% of foals and yearlings, and suggested that most infection occurs during the period of training and racing. The relationship between neutralizing antibodies and clinical protection has been established Diaz-Mendez et al. [29] . It is likely that the older horses in this study that were seronegative by the CF test were exposed to ERAV in their first year of training and had neutralizing antibodies at the start of the study that were sufficient to protect them from infection and subsequent seroconversion, as measured by the CF test. However, this hypothesis remains unproven and it is also possible that although they were in the same yard as the two-year-old horses, they may not have been exposed to the virus. In this study, the CF antibodies declined to the original levels within months, confirming that they are not persistent and thus, a useful indicator of recent exposure to virus.

The Zika MAC-ELISA is employed for in vitro qualitative detection of ZIKV-specific IgM antibodies in human sera. In addition, testing of ZIKV has been applied based on CDC clinical and epidemiological criteria for ZIKV which include clinical signs and symptoms associated with ZIKV infection and/or history of residence in or travel to a geographic region with active ZIKV transmission at the time of travel or other epidemiologic criteria that may indicate ZIKV testing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016a). As reported previously, immune responses under ZIKV infection have only been described in a small number of patients (n = 11), during the ZIKV virus outbreak in Yap (Lanciotti et al., 2008) . When MAC-ELISA for IgM and capture ELISA for IgG with the whole viral antigen (inactivated virus) and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were applied, IgM was found to appear as soon as 3 days after the onset of symptoms, while IgG appeared after 10 days in a patient with no history of previous flavivirus infections Martin et al., 2000) . Subsequently, it became possible to detect neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV as early as 5 days after the onset of fever. Euroimmun (2016) has developed the first complete test package for the serological detection of ZIKV infections. The ELISAs and indirect immunofluorescence assays allow the determination of specific antibodies (IgM, IgG) against a variety of viruses in the blood of infected patients. Huzly et al. (2016) reported that the use of putative cross reacting sera in ELISA tests from patients with Euroimmun anti-ZIKV IgG and IgM antibodies against ZIKV showed high specificity, confirming the applicability of Euroimmun ELISA for specific detection of virus in patients exposed previously to flavivirus or vaccine. The results suggest that this ELISA method could be an effective diagnostic tool for the screening and counseling of patients with a possibility of ZIKV virus infection, especially pregnant women and travelers commuting from ZIKV-endemic regions (Huzly et al., 2016) . To confirm the ability of the ZIKV ELISA to detect ZIKV antibodies, Tappe et al. (2014) analyzed serum samples collected from 10 patients in Brazil suffering from acute ZIKV infection. Laboratory results confirmed that the indirect immunofluorescent assay was able to define immunofluorescent assay titers for anti-ZIKV IgM (1: 1,280 to 1: > 20,480) and anti-ZIKV IgG (1: 320 to 1: > 20,480) (Tappe et al., 2014) .

Depending on the CFR value, the government response toward COVID-19 may vary, and estimates of CFR can also influence the strictness of policy judgement and the extent of containment and mitigation measures. For instance, a well-known CFR estimate for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003 was approximately 17% [3] , roughly indicating that one out of five diagnosed cases would die of the disease. SARS containment measures were implemented as early as possible due to high estimates of CFR.

To visualize malignant lesions in the oral cavity, different microscopic methods are available, which make use of various techniques, including autofluorescence, chemiluminescence, or dye-based tissue staining. However, due to the low sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic strategies, clinicians generally use biopsies to detect OSCC [9] . Nevertheless, successful diagnosis through tissue biopsy is highly dependent on acquiring whole and complete tissue samples from patients for examination. In this regard, biopsies harvested from oral cancer patients are often associated with the soft tissues that surround the cancer tissue. In addition, oral cancer frequently involves the development of multiple primary tumors. Indeed, the occurrence of a second primary tumor is 3-7% higher per year in oral cancer when compared to other malignancies [10] . Therefore, the identification of suitable and reliable OSCC biomarkers is essential for achieving early detection and treatment, which can reduce mortality rates in OSCC patients.

Such neutralizing antibodies may be provided through passive administration or induced by vaccination. We have previously shown that a human neutralizing antibody can protect guinea pigs against Ebola virus. However, here we show that this antibody does not protect monkeys against Ebola virus and surprisingly appears to have very little impact upon the rapid course of infection, despite being present at very high levels in the blood of the monkeys. We conclude that administering antibody prior to or immediately following exposure to Ebola virus, for example, after an accident in a research setting or a bioterrorist attack, is unlikely to be effective in preventing disease.

In the database, there are 4 types of premises infection status classifications: (1) confirmed positive, (2) presumed positive, (3) presumed negative and (4) confirmed negative.

Thus, premises that housed animals that were sourced from a PED-positive premises were classified as presumed positive due to movement of presumed infected pigs. Presumed negative premises were previously positive premises (i.e., either previously confirmed or presumed positive), where the producer implemented measures to eliminate PEDV from the herd and confirmed the virus to be eliminated through animal or environmental testing. Sampling methods for classifying premises as presumed negative were based on herd type and pig flow, and considered different types of samples (i.e., individual swabs, Swiffer samples, oral fluids, etc).

Early detection of disease outbreaks enables public health officials to implement disease control and prevention measures at the earliest possible time. For an infectious disease, improvement in detection time by even one day might enable public health officials to control the disease before it becomes widespread. In many cities such as New York City [1] , Washington, D.C. [2] , Boston [3, 4] , Denver, and Minneapolis, real-time, geographic, early outbreak detection system have been implemented. For a well-defined geographical area, standard disease surveillance uses purely temporal methods that seek anomalies in time series data without using spatial information [5] . The increased need for geographical cluster detection has coincided with an increasing availability of spatial data [6] . Investigators ask whether the geographical cluster is unlikely to have arisen by chance given random variations from the background incidence, according for the multiple comparisons inherent in the many possible cluster locations and size evaluated. Scan statistics are tools to answer such questions [7, 8] . Increasingly, there is interest in the prospective surveillance of new data as it becomes available in order to detect a localized disease outbreak as early as possible.

Many online surveillance systems that function based on real-time data have been developed involving a wide range of technologies and data sources to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases; these systems are continually being added to and evaluated [2] . Traditional passive surveillance systems typically rely on data submitted to the relevant public health authority by various healthcare providers [3] . This process is often expensive and inefficient, as substantial delays between an event and notifications are common, resulting in an incomplete account of disease emergence. Such limitations of traditional surveillance systems are a shared concern worldwide. The Internet has revolutionized efficient health-related communication and epidemic intelligence [4] . The increased frequency of Internet use for acquiring health information has contributed to the rise of web-based early detection systems for infectious diseases through various methodologies [5] . The principal concept is that diseaserelated information is retrieved from a wide range of available real-time electronic data sources, which play critical roles in the identification of early events and situational preparedness by offering current, highly local information about outbreaks, even from remote areas that have been unapproachable by traditional global public health efforts [6] . These systems not only monitor and predict disease outbreaks but also provide a user interface, and aid in visualization for an easier understanding and maneuvering of the operation. These new systems for early detection of epidemics are still in the nascent stage, but the concept and relevant promising mechanisms have been adopted and tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with positive indications for efficiency and feasibility [7] .

Starting from the moment they appear, neutralizing antibodies bind and neutralize the virus and prevent further spread in the body by inhibiting attachment and infection of new cells. It has been shown that neutralizing antibod-ies against many viruses are more rapidly induced during the immune response and reach higher titres compared to antibodies against other viral epitopes (Bachmann and Zinkernagel, 1997) [26] . In contrast, neutralizing antibodies against PCV2 could only be detected starting from 10 dpi by using a particularly sensitive SN assay (Meerts et al., 2005) [13] . These SN titres rose slowly until they could be detected with the classical SN assay starting from 4 weeks after inoculation (Pogranichnyy et al., 2000) [24]. The slow induction of neutralizing antibodies is a very effective mechanism for the virus to ensure a long period of replication in its host. In previous work, the observation was made that an increased replication of the virus in one pig, was correlated with a lack of neutralizing antibody production (Meerts et al., 2005) [13] . In the present study, it was confirmed that the absence of PCV2-neutralizing antibodies is indeed a recurring phenomenon in pigs with high PCV2-replication. In experimentally PCV2inoculated SPF pigs and in two field studies, a good correlation was observed between the absence or low titres of neutralizing antibodies against PCV2 and the occurrence of a high virus replication and the development of PMWS. This observation reveals a possible mechanism that allows the virus to replicate to a higher extent in a limited number of pigs. These pigs seem to be unable to recognize or produce antibodies against the epitope(s) that is (are) involved in the neutralization of the virus. With relation to other viral infections such as pseudorabies virus (Jacobs and Kimman, 1994) [27] , influenza virus (Lambkin and Dimmock, 1995) [28] or human rotavirus (Green et al., 1990 ) [29] , it has been shown that different animals do not all recognize the same epitopes. Various syndromes have already been ascribed to the inability of certain individuals to recognize certain epitopes (susceptibility to mastitis (Lunden et al., 1990) [30] , clinical outcome of Marek's disease virus (Wakenell et al., 1996) [31] ). The susceptibility to these syndromes is highly genetically determined. It has been demonstrated previously that the prevalence of PMWS highly differs between regions. Since contemporary pig industry still uses region-specific breeds, this could be interpreted as an indication that PMWS would be partly genetically determined. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to check for a similar mechanism in the recognition of PCV2-neutralizing epitope and the subsequent influence on the susceptibility of the host to PMWS.",35.216144613929146,16.783685380595568

Much of the Arabian Peninsula and all of the Horn of Africa lack baseline data describing the proportion of the community who may have been infected by a MERS-CoV. However, sero-surveys have had widespread use in elucidating the role of DCs as a transmission source for MERS-CoV. Because of the identity shared between DC and human MERS-CoV (see Molecular epidemiology: using genomes to understand outbreaks), serological assays for DC sero-surveys should be transferrable to human screening with minimal re-configuration. Also, no diagnostically relevant variation in neutralization activity have been found from among a range of circulating tested MERS-CoV isolates and sera, so whole virus or specific protein-based sero-assays should perform equivalently in detecting serological responses to the single MERS-CoV serotype [49] . The development of robust serological assays requires reliable panels of wellcharacterized animal or human sera, including those positive for antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as to likely sources of cross-reaction [64] . Obtaining these materials was problematic and slowed the development and commercialization of antibody detection assays for human testing [64] . A number of commercial ELISA kits, immunofluorescent assays (IFA) kits, recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies have been released [31, [65] [66] [67] [68] . Initially, conventional IFAs were used for human sero-surveys. These relied on MERS-CoV-infected cell culture as an antigen source, detecting the presence of human anti-MERS-CoV IgG, IgM or neutralizing antibodies in human samples [18, 48, 69] . No sign of MERS-CoV antibodies was found among 2,400 sera from patients visiting Hospital in Jeddah, from 2010 through 2012, prior to the description of MERS-CoV [18] . Nor did IFA methods detect any sign of prior MERS-CoV infection among a small sample of 130 healthy blood donors from another Hospital in Jeddah (collected between Jan and Dec 2012) [70] . Of 226 slaughterhouse workers, only eight (3.5 %) were positive by IFA, and those sera could not be confirmed by virus neutralization (NT) test. The study indicated that HCoV-HKU1 was a likely source of crossreactive antigen in the whole virus IFA [70] . Whole virus MERS-CoV IFA also suffered from some cross-reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera and this could not be resolved by an NT test which was also cross-reactive [71] . IFA using recombinant proteins instead of whole-virus IFA, has been shown to be a more specific tool [31] . Since asymptomatic zoonoses have been posited [72] , an absence of antibodies to MERS-CoV among some humans who have regular and close contact with camels may reflect the rarity of actively infected animals at butcheries, a limited transmission risk associated with slaughtering DCs [70] , a pre-existing cross-protective immune status or some other factor(s) resulting in a low risk of disease and concurrent seroconversion developing after exposure in this group.

Conventional vaccination approaches consistently failed to induce broadly neutralizing antibody responses (McMichael and Hanke 2003) . Nevertheless, distinct monoclonal antibodies have been described that are capable of neutralizing a broad range of different HIV isolates, suggesting that such antibody responses might be induced once an adequate vaccination strategy has been developed (Moore et al. 2001) . For example, altering the immunodominance pattern by using CD4-HIV envelope fusion constructs that expose normally occluded and conserved antigenic regions represents such an approach for the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (Fouts et al. 2003 ). An alternative strategy for the induction of antibodies that inhibit the infection of primary T cells with different primary HIV-1 isolates has been reported recently. This promising approach takes advantage of the highly conserved caveolin-1 binding domain of HIV-1 glycoprotein 41.

[1] It is critical to rapidly localize infections and identify the organism involved, especially for fungal infections, which need a specific treatment approach. Despite a standard diagnostic workup including chest radiograph (CXR) and microbiological screening, no focus is identified in up to 44% of patients. [2] This can partly be explained by the low sensitivity of radiographs for diagnosing pulmonary infections in neutropenic patients. [3] Acquiring CXRs in respiratory asymptomatic patients with febrile neutropenia is therefore controversial. The ESMO guidelines recommend performance of a CXR in every neutropenic patient with fever, whereas the IDSA guidelines suggest its use only in patients with respiratory signs or symptoms. [1, 4] In febrile neutropenia a substantial part (~10%) of infections is caused by invasive fungal disease (IFD). [5] IFD usually presents as a pulmonary infection, which is rarely visible on CXR and is therefore often missed in the early phase of neutropenic fever. Notably, a delayed start of appropriate treatment has a negative impact on clinical outcome. [6] In order to improve the early detection of pulmonary infiltrates in febrile neutropenia, other imaging tools have been investigated as an alternative to CXR. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) improved pulmonary focus detection: pulmonary abnormalities were found in 60% of the neutropenic patients with persistent fever (>48 hours) and a normal CXR. [7] Furthermore, direct initiation of effective antifungal treatment after the early detection of a halo sign on HRCT images, had a positive effect on treatment response and survival in case of IFD, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. [8] However, due to costs and high radiation doses of approximately 7 mSv average, HRCT scanning is usually not incorporated in the initial febrile neutropenia workup. [9] Another imaging modality that could be used for the evaluation of febrile neutropenia is low-dose CT scanning (LDCT). LDCT is performed with low mean radiation doses below 1.5 mSv and without the use of contrast. Two studies comparing LDCT to CXR in patients with persistent febrile neutropenia demonstrated an increased detection of pulmonary abnormalities. [10, 11] Therefore, we hypothesized that LDCT already acquired on day 1 of febrile neutropenia would improve detection of pulmonary infections. The primary aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of LDCT and 2-view CXR for early detection of pulmonary infiltrates. The secondary aim was to explore its performance for early IFD detection.",32.582519708994376,16.326890387756794

When markets do not contribute to disease transmission, only a very small percentage of nodes needs to be sampled using the TNS method. However, when we make the assumption that all batches on a market are well mixed, a much larger proportion of the nodes must be sampled. We also find that in this case, the RMS method requires sampling of a much smaller percentage of movements than the nonmarket scenario. This is unsurprising-markets represent very highly connected nodes in the network, and therefore when they are explicitly included in the model, an RMS approach will preferentially sample movements to and from these highly connected nodes. The model currently assumes that livestock do not stay overnight on markets, in line with Defra policy, and hence any infectious markets would become susceptible the following day. Should this not be the case, the role of markets in disease transmission may be slightly altered. Therefore, our results suggest that a more thorough, disease-specific analysis of the precise role of markets in disease transmission would be required in the future in order to determine context-specific optimal sampling strategies. However, our sensitivity analysis shows that TNS is the preferred sampling strategy for all studied transmission rates and infectious periods.",34.853128375142475,13.990344653065383

Recent incidences of infection have resulted in severe phenotypes including Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and fetal abnormalities such as microcephaly and spontaneous abortion [6] . Up to date, diagnosis of ZIKV infection has depended on molecular and serological testing, employing ELISA and RT-PCR platforms for IgM and RNA detection accordingly [7] . However, these methods of diagnosis are only useful for virus detection within a short frame from the symptom onset as levels of viral RNA and IgM antibodies decline over time. Laboratory testing of infants suspected of congenital ZIKV infection includes detection of viral RNA in serum and urine, and IgM antibodies in serum and CSF of infants [8] .

Both commercial EIAs and IgG IFAs demonstrate poor specificity overall, with IFA being slightly better than EIA. The overall specificity of flavivirus IgG EIAs is reported between 16 and 38% and improves slightly to 29 to 84% for IgG IFAs (12) . The addition of the POWV IgG IFA to the TBE-C EIA screen eliminated 35% of the cross-reactivity seen with the EIA alone. The immunological maturation of the IgG antibody response tends to foster the formation of antibodies directed to epitopes with greater likelihood for cross-reactivity (13) . While the specificity of flavivirus PRNTs detecting neutralizing IgG antibodies is high, this often comes at the cost of assay sensitivity. A PRNT 50 tends to be more sensitive in detecting early antibody responses, given the less stringent endpoint of Ͼ50% reduction in plaques, versus the highly specific Ͼ90% plaque reduction described here (14) . Also, low correlation between PRNT and IFA titer is not surprising since the IFA detects antibodies to a variety of structural and nonstructural viral proteins, whereas the PRNT primarily detects neutralizing antibodies directed to the envelope (E) protein of the virus (13) . When tested against non-tick-borne flavivirus samples, the POWV IgG IFA described here demonstrated an analytical specificity of 65%, comparable to that of other commercial flavivirus IgG IFAs (15). The overall cross-reactivity associated with detection of flavivirus IgM antibodies is significantly lower than that seen with IgG antibodies, and IgM IFA specificity was 20 to 30% higher than IgM EIA when patients with suspected flavivirus infections were screened for several different viruses (12) . The addition of the POWV IgM IFA to the TBE-C EIA screen eliminated 55% of the cross-reactivity seen with the IgM EIA alone. Many commercially available flavivirus IgM-specific serologic tests report sensitivity lower than that seen with IgG assays, due primarily to the fact that PRNT is considered the gold standard for the differential serodiagnosis. Published reports confirm that, in patients with primary flavivirus infection, the IgM response likely consists of antibodies with minimal to no virus-neutralizing capacity (16, 17) . In a study assessing the performance of a commercially available WNV IgM EIA, 14 of 44 CDC IgM protocolnegative samples were found positive. The apparent lack of IgM specificity observed with that assay may be attributed to the use of PRNT to confirm IgM positives as part of the CDC protocol (18) . In studies where convalescent-phase samples can be collected from patients 2 to 4 weeks after infection, the use of PRNT may be helpful to confirm the accuracy of acute-phase detection of IgM. In the studies presented here, we were limited by design to samples collected only at the time of clinical presentation, and therefore, follow-up convalescent-phase samples were not available. The lack of a reliable and accurate predicate assay for use as a gold standard when developing flavivirus IgM assays requires further study. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a single IgM-positive result for arboviral diagnosis is considered a presumptive positive and should be confirmed by RT-PCR, virus isolation, and/or PRNT to discriminate potentially cross-reactive antibodies (19) . In the current study, one POWV IgM IFA-positive sample was confirmed positive by POWV RT-PCR with the remaining IgM IFA-positive samples lacking detectable viral genome. Studies performed with WNV-positive patients show that viremia can be detected for an average of 7 days and that IgM antibody becomes detectable a median of 4 days after the midpoint of the interval for RNA detection, for an overlap of only 1 to 2 days (20) . Therefore, RT-PCR cannot function as a sensitive confirmatory assay for IgM-positive samples across all time points. The current state of diagnostics for POWV infection includes initial serological testing performed using IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IgG ELISA with confirmatory testing utilizing PRNT, a 4-fold or greater increase in antibody titer between acute-and convalescent-phase sera, virus isolation, or detection of virus-specific RNA. Only a few state health labs and the CDC offer this testing, and the labor-intensive nature of the confirmatory tests often delays the reporting of final results beyond the period of clinical utility. In addition, testing is usually limited to patients presenting with neurologic complications; therefore, little is known regarding the overall prevalence of and clinical symptoms associated with POWV infection. Limited data regarding cocirculation of Lyme disease and POWV seroprevalence in the Midwest have been published (21) . The test panel described here allows for the simple and efficient detection of acute POWV infection. However, due to the cross-reactivity seen for all flavivirus IgG assays, it is imperative that exposure to other flaviviruses and travel and vaccination history be considered when interpreting IgG test results. This panel is a diagnostic tool that can play an important role in further defining the full spectrum of POWV disease.",33.19469671039289,15.697502950886655

This approach was revived with a novelty, wherein the engineered RSV F protein aggregates formed nanoparticles and were used as vaccine, and these nanoparticles induced protective immunity in cotton rats [132] . To combat RSV, host neutralizing antibodies are always more preferred than the therapeutic antibodies. But the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies are larger than those of the therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (palivizumab and motavizumab). Thus, the use of these epitopes for neutralizing antibodies as a vaccine requires the retention of immuno functional conformation while getting rid of the undesired protein. RSV F oligomeric protein nanoparticle was synthesized by inserting recombinant RSV F gene into Baculovirus and expressed in Sf9 insect cell lines. This resulted in high recombinant protein expression compared to native protein. This also resulted in the conformation of rosette nanoparticles which was the aggregate of multiple RSV F oligomers found to be immunogenic.

Extensive pooling makes hybridizationbased enrichment sequencing more economical. Viral target enrichment could be applied as an economical approach to sequencing viruses known to mutate quickly and therefore evade other assays, fastidious organisms, or complex samples of limited volume. For example, this method could be prescribed to a scenario in which multiple serotypes of a virus such as DENV are expected to be present in a sample but detection is prohibited via conventional methods such as amplicon sequencing due to low titers. Viral target enrichment designed for a broad panel of targets could also be useful to the infectious disease field by enabling detection of low-titer viruses present in clinical samples taken from patients suffering from symptoms of unknown etiology. Another applicable use of a broad probe panel could be to perform environmental sampling. The aforementioned applications often involve complex samples of limited volume, for which this method is ideal. An important caveat to this approach is that while viral target enrichment is an economical method by which to reduce background noise in a metagenomic sample, probe design requires prior knowledge of the closest-sequenced genome for each viral target. Amplicon sequencing may be the best approach for previously known samples and unbiased whole shotgun sequencing may be more appropriate for a virus-rich sample. None of these approaches obviates the use of amplification by polymerase chain reaction or the potential introduction of sequence errors, and so standard quality analyses by computational methods should always be employed.

According to the modified recommendations of the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of RSV, palivizumab is recommended for infants with congenital heart disease (CHD), chronic lung disease (CLD), and birth before 32 weeks [104] . Minimum 5 doses are recommended irrespective of the month of the first dose for all geographical locations for infants with a gestational age of 32 weeks 0 days to 32 weeks 6 days without hemodynamically significant CHD or CLD.

Aligning with the World Health Organization's (WHO) interest in countries developing event-based surveillance systems, EpiCore utilizes crowdsourcing to gather supplementary information to validate rumours and informal reports about disease outbreaks. In this paper we describe the EpiCore disease surveillance project, and analyse data from Objective To describe a crowdsourced disease surveillance project (EpiCore) and evaluate its usefulness in obtaining information regarding potential disease outbreaks. Methods Volunteer human, animal and environmental health professionals from around the world were recruited to EpiCore and trained to provide early verification of health threat alerts in their geographical region via a secure, easy-to-use, online platform. Experts in the area of emerging infectious diseases sent requests for information on unverified health threats to these volunteers, who used local knowledge and expertise to respond to requests. Experts reviewed and summarized the responses and rapidly disseminated important information to the global health community through the existing event-based disease surveillance network, ProMED. Findings From March 2016 to September 2017 September , 2068 EpiCore volunteers from 142 countries were trained in methods of informal disease surveillance and use of the EpiCore online platform. These volunteers provided 790 individual responses to 759 requests for information addressing unverified health threats in 112 countries; 361 (45%) responses were considered to be useful. Most responses were received within hours of the requests. The responses led to 194 ProMED posts, of which 99 (51%) supported verification of an outbreak, were published on ProMED and sent to over 87 000 subscribers. Conclusion There is widespread willingness among health professionals around the world to voluntarily assist efforts to verify and provide supporting information on unconfirmed health threats in their region.

In the future, it would be desirable to develop an M. pneumoniae diagnosis kit that can diagnose pathogens from nasal or pharyngeal swabs at outpatient clinics or the bedside of patients. In Japan, two official pathogen surveillance methods have been conducted under the infection control laws: sentinel pathogen surveillance and active surveillance. The official pathogenic surveillance has been conducted at sentinel medical institutions regardless of outbreaks. On the other hand, in patients with serious diseases, active pathogenic surveillance has sometimes been conducted on the basis of notifications by medical institutions. However, active surveillance is conducted only when an infection spreads widely enough to cause serious problems in a particular region and the surveillance of pathogens may not be timely enough to mount a response to control outbreaks. Pathogenic surveillance for all patients with signs of an infection would detect agents of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases; however, the cost would be prohibitive. Therefore, system coordination to perform pathogen surveillance based on early detection of outbreaks is necessary. The scheme proposed by the present study uses PCR testing triggered by detection alerts from syndromic surveillance systems. In general, syndromic surveillance offers earlier detection of infectious diseases than traditional surveillance. Moreover, if the pathogen remains unknown following bedside testing using several rapid tests or other typical examinations, the proposed scheme requires the collection of specimens as soon as possible and sending them to a laboratory for definitive diagnoses. However, it takes a few days to transfer the specimens and a few extra days for the information of the identified pathogen to be shared among medical facilities, public health centers, and local governments in the involved areas. In the proposed scheme, we can use pathogenic information to control ongoing outbreaks and, hopefully, decrease the number of potential infections.",26.60097487124881,13.242468466098886

In general, bats seem to produce lower level of neutralizing antibodies in response to viral infection, possibly due to the lower affinity of the bat antibodies [14] . Alternatively, it is possible that one or more as-yet-unknown ebolaviruses are circulating among the bat populations sampled in this study, producing antibodies cross-reactive with, but not neutralizing EBOV or RESTV. Also, a new ebolavirus species closely-related with EBOV but not the RESTV might be missed during the initial screening using Reston-NP solely. An initial screening for eboalvirus antibodies should be conducted by using ELISA with a 1:1 mixture of recombinant NP of EBOV and RESTV to detect wider range of ebolavirus species.

Bat species in the genera Rousettus, Hipposideros, Myotis, Miniopterus and Pipistrellus naturally reside in trees, buildings and caves that can be in close proximity to human residential areas, increasing the potential of zoonotic transmission from bats to humans. There is evidence of human infection of ebolavirus in central Africa as a result of direct bat-to-human transmission [16] . In the Guangdong and Hainan provinces of China, local populations customarily eat large bats, such as Leschenault's rousette.

Daily monitoring by trained personnel identified sporadic coughing and sneezing throughout the group, mainly in morning hours. No other symptom was observed. Factors such as forest density, chimpanzee group fission-fusion and amount of time spent on the ground vs. on trees strongly influence whether individuals can be observed on a daily basis. In such conditions, the detection of disease onset and follow-up of symptoms' course over time as well as the collection of samples is very complicated. During this outbreak, symptoms were reported once in at least nine individuals; of these, six were consistently identified as symptomatic on three consecutive days (Fig. 1 , bold names).

Although E12R4 elicited significantly higher cross-reactive antibody responses than E3 measured by HPV capsid-based ELISA assay (Figure 3 ), there were no significant differences between the crossneutralizing antibody titers in E12R4 and E3 antisera (P.0.05), suggesting that the majority of serum antibodies induced by E12R4 were not neutralizing antibodies.

For most pathogens, infection status and periods of infectiousness have to be established based on regular screening. Capturing and sampling individuals on a regular basis may accomplish this. The appropriate length of the interval between samples would thereby depend on the biology and epidemiology of the infectious agent. Because the humoral immune response takes several weeks to develop, individuals may be infectious even if no antibodies can be detected. Thus, screening would ideally involve serological tests as well as efforts to directly detect the infectious pathogen. Problems again arise if not all individuals can be resampled regularly, as will often be the case in wildlife populations. Furthermore, capturing and collecting blood samples may be considered too traumatic to be carried out frequently. Fortunately, considerable progress has been made in recent years regarding the use of noninvasive sampling of wildlife species, including techniques for disease screening. For example, Santiago et al. (2003a Santiago et al. ( , 2003b were able to determine infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in wild chimpanzees using fresh fecal and urine samples that yielded both antibodies and virus RNA.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples from neonatal calves as a method for the early detection of persistent BVDV infection. Three hundred thirty-two 1-to 4-week-old dairy calves were screened for BVDV as part of a routine control program. Formalin-fixed skin biopsy samples were stained for BVDV antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the results were compared to those of virus isolation (VI) from white blood cell preparations. Six calves were positive by both IHC and VI and remained positive for BVDV upon subsequent follow-up testing; thus, they were classified as persistently infected with BVDV. One calf was positive by VI but negative by IHC. On subsequent testing, the calf was negative by VI, suggesting that the initial VI result was due to an acute BVDV infection. One calf was positive by IHC but negative by VI. This calf remained negative by VI on follow-up testing.

However, they require that suitable pathogen-specific antibodies are available or can be produced. Antibodies that are specific to given species are relatively easy to produce for many plant viruses but are less so for some bacterial plant pathogens or more complex organisms such as fungi. Antibodies raised to fungi may even be life stage-specific and therefore not suitable for detecting, for example, resting spores. In contrast, it is (at least in theory) possible to design real-time PCR assays that are specific to most plant pathogens including at the race or sub-species level, as has already been described.",29.245585317551452,14.240479962327854

Early diagnosis of CDAD, prompt isolation of symptomatic patients and reducing antimicrobial treatment are essential first steps. The infection control measures include recommendations to isolate infected patient on a single room with designated toilet, to apply proper hand hygiene with soap and water, to use appropriate protective clothing (gloves and aprons or gowns), to intensify environmental cleaning with a chlorine containing disinfectant and to take specific precautions for the use of devices (disposable or dedicated to individual patient). Patient isolation must continue at least until diarrhoea has ceased. Each hospital should have an appropriate surveillance system to recognize an increase of the incidence of CDAD in an early stage. All infection control measures should be written in a local protocol so that additional measures can be carried out as soon as a problem with CDAD arises. When outbreaks occur, additional recommendations include a reinforcement of general and hand washing measures, intensifying of testing patients with diarrhoea for C. difficile, reinforcement of environmental cleaning, information and education of healthcare workers, cleaning department and visitors, cohorting of infected patients, and eventually closure of the unit followed by intensive environmental cleaning. Restricted antibiotic prescribing is also highly recommended to reduce polypharmacy and duration of administration. Second and third generations cephalosporins, clindamycin and more recently fluoroquinolones have been identified as potential risk factors. Although some hospitals report successes for enhanced environmental cleaning with potentially effective agents such as hydrogen peroxide vapour, the evidence is too scarce to consider this as an evidence-based approach.",28.04774664700865,13.019066556307612

This is particularly relevant when slow-growing or fastidious organisms are involved and the limitations of some existing diagnostic tools are driving researchers to consider alternative methods, as demands on quantity and rapidity of testing methods are increasing [1] . Serological methods provide an indication of exposure to a pathogen and are best used for screening populations. However, they also require an adequate time post-infection/exposure for antibodies to develop and may be unable to distinguish between different strains or antigenic types of pathogen. Zoonotic pathogens make up the majority (75%) of emerging diseases and wildlife are a major source of these pathogens [2] . Early detection of pathogens in wild animals would be useful in identifying risk factors associated with disease transmission to humans or domestic animals, and this could help prevent a possible outbreak. It has also been suggested that prevention of disease, which could be aided by an effective surveillance system, is better than reacting to an outbreak, or to finding a cure [3] . Microarrays offer the advantage of testing large numbers of samples simultaneously, coupled with screening a single sample for multiple pathogens. Use of this technology would enable timely, accurate and inexpensive detection of pathogens, which could lead to more effective control of these infectious diseases, which has positive implications for public health [4] . There are a wide ranging number of potential applications for pathogen detection arrays; and have been used for the detection of novel pathogens, as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5] , simultaneous detection of Newcastle disease virus and avian influenza virus in birds [6] and detection of viruses that can cause vesicular or vesicular-like lesions in livestock [7] .",46.00371975415881,18.789167361953627

Tests for use in conjunctival samples suggest an overall sensitivity of 38%, though this rate was higher when taken earlier in the illness [133] . Among respiratory specimens, the sensitivity of antigen testing may also be relatively low compared to testing for other respiratory viral pathogens. The specificity and predictive values remain close to 100%, however, and ultimately the value of the test is most likely dependent on the adequacy of the sample taken [134] .

During this period, the rate of spread of the infectious agent will be determined by the biology of the agent and by the efficacy of the standard precautions that are in place to limit cross-contamination between cages and rooms. The use of isolation-type caging, HEPA-filtered change stations and ""clean to dirty"" personnel traffic can be very effective, but the mere presence of the equipment will not prevent cross-contamination if proper husbandry practices and barrier precautions are not followed by animal care and research staff. Of course, it is always better to prevent problems by eliminating the initial contamination event than it is to rely on detection and containment after the fact. For these reasons, strict control of animal and personnel movements and the utilization of optimal barrier housing methods are key factors to minimize the introduction of unwanted infectious agents. efforts there is always the possibility that quarantine procedures may fail to detect the presence of an infectious agent that was present in the colony of origin or acquired during transport. For example, the arrival of large groups of mice into quarantine may lead to detection failures because not every incoming cage of mice can be reasonably monitored using contact sentinels. As mentioned previously, the exclusive use of bedding sentinels to detect potential infectious agents during quarantine may yield detection failures because not all agents are consistently transmitted using soiled bedding. Finally, some infectious agents may be at a very low incidence, for example, a single cage of mice out of a larger shipment may be infested with fur mites and the exposure and sampling methods used during quarantine may fail to detect such a limited infestation. Failure of quarantine may not be noticed immediately, because barrier precautions such as isolation caging and the use of HEPA-filtered change stations may slow the spread of the undetected contaminant for a time until it reaches a prevalence detectable by the sentinel testing program or clinical illness becomes apparent.",30.329916771983456,15.138908656296504

Dorgham et al. in 2005 screened a 15-mer RPL using a broadly neutralizing antibody and, using the selected inoviruses, were able to induce antibodies in vaccinated mice. However, the induced antibodies did not exhibit neutralizing activity against HIV-1 [68] . Other RPLs screened against monoclonal and broadly neutralizing antibodies have produced antibodies that do not have neutralizing capabilities [55, 70] . In one such case, crystallization of the specific mimotope revealed that the oligopeptide borne by the inovirus was structurally different that the natural antibody epitope [69] .

True to its original use, ELISAs can be used to quantify the presence of hamster IgM and IgG. Out of the limited number of commercially available anti-hamster antibodies, antihamster IgM and IgG are available and have been used to show the presence of antigen specific antibodies in various hamster models (Safronetz et al. 2009; Prescott et al. 2015; . In general, the use of a direct ELISA assay is ideal for detection of antibodies in the serum of hamsters. Therefore a recombinant or purified antigen is necessary to coat ELISA plates before the detection of specific antibodies in serum can be achieved. This has been performed in models for hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome caused by Andes virus (Safronetz et al. 2009 ), Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Prescott et al. 2015) , and MERS-CoV (de Wit et al. 2013) among others.

These advances are fueled by new antibody screening and isolation technologies, a better understanding of how to construct and use non-immune and immune antibody repertoires, and growing interest in virology. The emergence of new viral pathogens has also kept the field ablaze, in part because the globalization Box 2 Antibody-dependent enhancement ADE is a mechanism by which virus-specific antibodies enhance viral entry into-and in some cases, replication in-monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells through interaction with Fcγ and/or complement receptors. ADE has been demonstrated in vitro using anti-dengue and anti-WNV antibodies and cells bearing Fcγ receptors, as well as in monkeys infused with anti-dengue antibodies 36, 75, [91] [92] [93] . ADE is the proposed mechanism responsible for Dengue hemorrhagic fever and Dengue shock syndrome, two clinical conditions that are frequently seen in patients infected with a second heterotropic infection or in infants with maternally transferred anti-Dengue antibodies. Infection with Dengue virus or any other flavivirus induces broadly cross-reactive, but weakly neutralizing as well as non-neutralizing antibodies 94, 95 . ADE occurs when the concentration of neutralizing antibody falls below the stoichiometric threshold for neutralization and becomes sub-neutralizing. These preexisting sub-neutralizing (and non-neutralizing) antibodies and the infecting Dengue virus form complexes that bind to Fcγ receptorbearing cells, leading to increased virus uptake and replication 36,37,75 . of world travel has increased the risk for rapid transmission and dissemination of new viral diseases. There is also a growing realization that for some viral pathogens, optimal disease prevention and management may not be achieved through traditional vaccination of the population at risk, but rather through instituting local, regional and international public health-care measures early to prevent and contain the infections, as was successfully demonstrated in the case of SARS 67 . In situations where the frequency of viral infection is low, protection could be provided by passive immunotherapy during the period of high-risk exposure, avoiding the potential side effects of vaccination that can cause untoward morbidity and even rare mortality, as exemplified by yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease 68 . Moreover, for some antiviral vaccines, high titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies are either not elicited, or their titers wane over time. In either case, the nAb titers may not be protective at the time of viral challenge, which may occur years after vaccination. Another possible risk is ADE for vaccines against viruses for which enhanced disease-associated clinical syndromes have been demonstrated and/or postulated to occur when antibody titers fall below their neutralization threshold (Box 2). In other cases, dominant antibody responses may be stronger against the vaccine strain than a secondary viral challenge stain, a phenomenon known as 'original antigenic sin' 69 . In all of the above examples, the use of short-term passive immunotherapy where high titer of nAbs can be readily achieved may provide some tangible advantages over vaccination.",34.324914305676145,15.533764119192156

BK virus infection is generally asymptomatic. Renal tubular cell injury in PVAN is reflected in a rising serum creatinine. Most centers have developed screening programs to document early disease. The use of urine cytology to detect the presence of infected decoy cells in the urine has approximately 100% sensitivity for BK virus infection but a low (29%) predictive value. 64 Detection of urine BK virus by electron microscopy, urine BK viral (DNA) loads greater than 7 log gEq/mL or BK virus VP1 gene mRNA of >6 log copies/ng total urine RNA are useful diagnostically. Patients with BK nephropathy have higher plasma viral loads (>7700 BK virus copies per mL of plasma, P < 0.001, 50% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value) when compared to patients without such disease. 34 A high serum BK viral load is considered a basis for reduction in immunosuppression, especially if serum creatinine has risen. However, the diagnosis should be made by demonstration of BK virus cytopathic changes with cellular infiltration consistent with the diagnosis of interstitial nephritis in the allograft and by immunohistology for BK virus proteins, or by in situ hybridization for BK virus nucleic acids in a renal biopsy. There is a semiquantitative scoring system for histologic changes of PVAN. For immunohistochemistry, cross-reacting antibodies against the large T-antigen of the simian virus 40 or antibodies against BK virus VP1 or agnoprotein have been used. PVAN is characterized by intranuclear polyomavirus inclusion bodies in tubular epithelial and/ or glomerular cells. Fibrosis is often prominent, occasionally with calcification. PVAN is often focal, with false-negative biopsies in some cases. Graft rejection may accompany PVAN, and complicates both diagnosis and management.",29.819168012292284,13.445075257949913

This is where risk research and disaster research meet. Mitigation is not necessarily to ""eliminate risk"", but to reduce loss to an acceptable level. Even in the United States, mitigation is still one of the weakest links in disaster management practices. There are mainly two reasons. First, mitigation measures are generally proposed by academics rather than policymakers, and it is not easy to turn research issues into policy issues; second, mitigation measures need to be implemented down to earth, but general management departments lack the motivation to do so, because it is disaster management departments, not them, that will be responsible for the consequences of inadequate mitigation. Thus mitigation is not merely a technological issue. Only by reflecting on the negative consequences of social action from time to time and internalizing them can individual behavior and habits, organizational social responsibility and government policy preferences be developed, and a risk culture be fostered. Therefore, how to cultivate a risk culture is an important issue that derives from mitigation.",45.01357781483584,17.945283852595573

The study showed no survival benefit for those administered hyperimmune serum. One limitation of the study was that the concentration of neutralizing antibodies in donor serum was unknown. For MERS, the development of neutralizing antibodies does not predict viral clearance [48] although one small study did suggest a potential correlation between neutralization titers and outcome [49] . Importantly, indirect evidence against a role for neutralizing antibodies to protect against future disease is the observation that new infections continue to be documented for those with camel exposure (http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2016-08-8-001.aspx), a group for whom repeated and ongoing exposure should be the norm and for whom immune responses against MERS are well documented [50] .

HPP appropriations have decreased from $426 million in FY2010 to $255 million in FY2014, including a one-third cut in the FY2014 omnibus. 56 HPP provides financial incentives to ensure that hospitals are able to coordinate, cooperate, and reduce loss of life during an emergency.

Mitigation is taking action now-before the next disaster-to reduce human and financial consequences later (analyzing risk, reducing risk, insuring against risk). 10 Risk Reduction works to reduce risk to life and property through land use planning, floodplain management, [and] the adoption of sound building practices . . . Mitigation projects that reduce risk include elevating, relocating, or acquiring properties located in floodplains and returning them to open space, and the reinforcing of buildings in earthquake-prone areas. 10a Mitigation begins with local communities assessing their risks from recurring problems and making a plan for creating solutions to these problems and reducing the vulnerability of their citizens and their property to risk. 11 However, since the mid-1990s, mitigation planning has become increasingly more complex. Terrorist attacks, industrial accidents, and new or reemerging infectious diseases are just a few of the threats that have started to consume more planning time and resources. The growing scope of threats that must be addressed in mitigation strategies challenges all aspects of planning and response at all levels of government. [12] [13] [14] The importance of sharing intelligence information, for example, at the earliest possible stage of a terrorist attack, is recognized in national policy as a critical mitigation asset. Fusion centers have been implemented in jurisdictions across the United States. 15, 16 It is imperative that first responders and hospitals receive notification at the earliest indication of a contagious biological attack. Early notification allows state, regional, and local communities to implement appropriate responses that provide isolation, treatment, prophylaxis, and stockpiling and staging of federal resources, which, when rapidly implemented, could contain a potentially widespread event. This intelligence sharing must become a larger part of mitigation efforts aimed at also limiting the impact of natural and human-made disasters. The elevated status of intelligence within the National Incident Management System (NIMS) establishes the importance of early and effective intelligence sharing. The challenge is to establish these sharing relationships before a disaster by incorporating them into an ongoing hazard monitoring process, drills, exercises, and day-to-day activities to ensure that this critical resource is operational when needed to mitigate the consequences of a disaster. 17 A similar analogy can be made with the early warning given to the medical community when a surveillance system detects an unusual cluster of illnesses, which triggers an investigation leading to increased awareness, training, laboratory recognition, and possible identification of a sentinel case long before the initial diagnosis may be confirmed at a physician's office or health care facility.",35.75913937444417,12.928455554884918

As the global human population increases, so will anthropogenic pressures on wildlife and the environment, augmenting the likelihood of zoonotic pathogen spillover from animal to human populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies zoonoses as emerging threats and describe them as previously occurring phenomena that have an increasing trend and expansion in geographical, host or vector range. More than 60 % of all emerging infectious diseases are from zoonoses (Mackenzie and Jeggo, 2013) .

The individual with HIV has weakened defenses against invading organisms and is susceptible to opportunistic infections which, left untreated, ultimately lead to death. HIV created a huge dilemma for boxing and the other sports in which bleeding can occur. After concerned physicians advocated safer protocols, mandatory testing was initiated early followed by recommendations to stop a bout until bleeding was controlled. 68, 69 Safety measures such as universal precautions and mandatory testing were incorporated quickly by most boxing commissions. In boxing, guidelines for excessive bleeding were easy to implement because controlling bleeding is always an important objective for strategic and psychological reasons. Excessive blood cannot only impair vision but distract a boxer if he is constantly trying to wipe it away. Some boxers will also display diminished skills at the sight of their own blood. Overall, the two preventative strategies of testing and bleeding control seem effective in minimizing the incidence of boxing-related transmission of HIV. There is no evidence that HIV can be transmitted through saliva, sweat, or tears, 68 so there is no danger associated with normal body contact such as touching and sharing sports equipment or towels. Also, contaminated surfaces such as ring mats, toilet seats, and hot tubs do not pose risks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of transmission of HIV during sports is small and there are no documented cases of HIV contamination during sports. 70 Evidence exists suggesting that the baseline risk of HIV may be higher in competitive athletes. This evidence seems more related to ''risky'' lifestyle behavior including increased alcohol consumption, inconsistent contraceptive use, and multiple sex partners than the inherent risks of the sport. 71 Intramuscular injection of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs constitutes another HIV risk behavior associated with athletes. The case of a body builder with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) suggests that like in the general population, contaminated needles are also a source of HIV infection. 72 There is a report of HIV seroconversion as a result of bleeding during a soccer match in Italy. 73 After further investigation, transmission through nonsports activity could not be ruled out because the man involved also worked in a drug dependency rehabilitation program. There are also some case reports of HIV transmission during bloody street fights. 74, 75 These events should not be compared with boxing, because they lack the rules and regulations that minimize the dangers and limit morbidity and mortality. Evidence of HIV infection can be found by testing for the antibodies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and Western blot test). Unfortunately, the tests do not become positive until 3 to 4 weeks (sometimes even months) after infection. Quantifying HIV RNA level (viral load) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is 95% to 98% sensitive for HIV, becomes positive within 11 days of infection. 76 At present the ELISA and Western blot tests are the accepted screening tests for boxing. A possible way to strengthen the current protocols may be by mandating viral load testing and including amateur as well as professional boxers. Justifying a change in tests may not be easy because antibody testing is the accepted standard and seems to be working well. There is no denying that that in King amateur bouts the chance of HIV transmission through lacerations is less, but not impossible, with the use of headgear. However, nose bleeds are very common and could increase the risk of transmission. Testing amateur boxers may not be cost effective but it would make the disease-screening process more thorough. There is some opinion that the physical demands of the sport would limit participation by athletes infected with HIV. 77 The opposite may be true, with the exertion from boxing training potentially being beneficial for an individual with HIV. 78 Finally, with the current regimen of medications that are able to minimize the viral loads, a boxer with HIV may be able to compete without any obvious limitations and it may not be detectable with the current screening methods. There is a famous case of a boxer diagnosed with HIV who continues to fight professionally. His case is unusual because his initial test was reported positive but subsequent tests have all been negative. It is uncertain whether he was the victim of a false positive, or for whatever reasons, his virus is presently undetectable. At present most professional boxing commissions are not willing to take a chance and allow him to continue competing in their states.",32.58537027495681,15.005753191711033

The ideal colonic preparation is still under debate. It is general consensus that patients should undergo a low-residue diet before the examination, and to ingest a cathartic agent the day before. Different cathartic agents are available. In order to improve sensitivity and specificity, ""tagging"" of residual fluids, in combination with the administration of a cathartic agent, is now routinely used. It consists in the administration, prior to CTC, of water-soluble iodinated contrast medium or alternatively diluted barium sulfate suspension. Since bowel cleansing is consistently the most unpleasant part of colonic examination, minimally-invasive preparation schemes (using mild or no laxatives at all), more comfortable and less demanding for patients, are now available. For reduced bowel preparations the combination with faecal/fluid tagging is mandatory. Gaseous colonic distention is another critical step since collapsed bowel is a frequent cause of missed lesions at CTC. The use of a rectal balloon catheter has been replaced by a thin rubber tube in order to improve patient compliance and to minimise risks of perforation. To further improve Patient comfort, automatic CO2 insufflation represents a possible alternative to room air. The administration of a spasmolytic agent is particularly useful in the case of colonic spasm, typically in sigmoid colon, and in patients with severe diverticular disease. The use of a MDCT scanner is mandatory and dedicated scanning protocols need to take into account radiation exposure, especially in individuals undergoing screening CTC. Learning Objectives: 1.

Wide variations in estimates of preintervention risk existed, most likely as a result of differences in surveillance intensity. The same caveats applied to postintervention risk estimates, although countries with active hemovigilance systems were better able to make this assessment because of their enhanced surveillance mechanisms and more robust adverse event definitions. Estimates of false-negative testing varied widely, although based on American Red Cross data, it is possible to determine an approximate 50% reduction in reported septic reactions and sepsisrelated fatalities after apheresis platelet transfusions after implementation of the 2003 AABB standard.",29.000004943198995,13.927493514215412

Since the neutralization titers measured on replication-competent SARS-CoV and pseudotypes are highly correlated, this assay can be widely applied in routine diagnostics and used for the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines and immune therapies for SARS, without the pathogen itself being handled. This advantage is important because nosocomial infections have arisen from laboratory handling of SARS-CoV in Taiwan, Singapore, and Beijing (37) . A lack of good, quantitative assays for SARS-CoV replication in vitro also makes the pseudotype assay, with its easily interchangeable reporter genes, a more flexible platform with which to study neutralization and cell tropism. Our assay detected neutralizing antibodies generated during both the acute and convalescent phases of SARS infection. When looking for neutralizing antibody responses, previous researchers have predominantly tested samples taken during the convalescent phase of the disease, whereas we found that during the period 8-14 days after onset of fever, 9 patients in our cohort had neutralizing responses to SARS S protein. Viral load, as measured by real-time RT-PCR, for 19 of the patients in our cohort, was previously shown to peak at approximately day 4 or 5 after onset of fever and then decreased to barely detectable around the time of seroconversion (38) , which suggests that the neutralizing antibody response may play a role in viral clearance. This finding has implications for diagnos-tics and surveillance, since positive diagnoses for neutralizing antibodies can be made earlier in infection and as a complement to testing for IgG responses by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. SARS has yet to manifest itself as a seasonal epidemic threat like influenza, which makes mass vaccination an unlikely scenario. The rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies seen in this study suggests that localized vaccination with an effective vaccine is likely to help control the spread of SARS-CoV during an outbreak, if vaccine elicits as rapid a response as live virus.",32.097591511217544,15.561439684165244

A stepwise introduction of sampling methods was used as the clinical capacity for specimen collection and laboratory capacity increased. Our assessment of pneumonia etiology (shown in Figure 1 ) should not be taken as a definitive study of etiology in Kilifi, because the full sampling algorithm was not implemented until the second quarter of the year and complete sampling was only available in one-third of the case patients. Indeed, the results illustrate the potential variability of etiology depending on the sampling methods used. Lung aspirates and postmortem studies were not performed. The case-control analysis was limited to a comparison of results from NPS specimens and serological testing; we could not assess the association between pathogen detection from other nonsterile site specimens and pneumonia hospitalization. We did not collect information on the duration of symptoms in case patients and controls, and it is possible that the high prevalence of viral detection in controls was related to illness in the recent past. Among case patients with VSP, 14% had malaria parasitemia and more than one-third were not given a diagnosis of pneumonia at the time of discharge. This is not unexpected, given that the World Health Organization case definition is deliberately nonspecific in order to be sensitive. In hospital settings, the specificity of the case definition for SP and VSP could probably be improved through the use of chest radiography, which will be a component of the PERCH study. This pilot study illustrates how adding specimens and assays to the sampling algorithm significantly increases the detection of potential pathogens and the impact of adjusting the assessment of etiology based on the results of a case-control analysis. Despite fairly comprehensive testing, the etiology of pneumonia remained unknown in a quarter of case patients. In some, the diagnosis may not have been pneumonia, and for others, more extensive testing may have been needed.",35.73408072817082,15.478388263481001

In these cases, it seems likely that the mechanism of protection in vivo is essentially equivalent to neutralization in vitro. In a number of other cases, it appears that F(ab ) 2 fragments, that are equally active as whole IgG molecules at neutralization in vitro, are ineffective at protection. Further, neutralizing mouse IgG1 switch variants are ineffective at protection, whereas IgG2a molecules are effective. In many of these examples, protection is independent of complement, suggesting that protection by neutralizing antibodies requires activity against infected cells as well as free virions. This requirement, in some cases, for activity against infected cells as well as virions may contribute to observations of incomplete correlation between neutralization and protection for neutralizing antibodies, although other factors such as the use of different cell types in vitro and in vivo should be considered. It is worth emphasizing, though, that most neutralizing antibodies protect at appropriate concentrations, and antibodies assessed as the most potent in neutralization assays in vitro generally are the most effective at protection in vivo.",29.62131014886938,12.656892496329595

Our results agree with previous studies detecting HRV through RT-PCR, which have similarly detected HRV in 12%-35% of asymptomatic children [5, 23, 24] . Our high rate is unsurprising in this setting given the frequent detection of HRV overall, and the fact that we have documented year-round exposure to HRV in the childcare centers included in the study. Previous studies have shown high rates of asymptomatic HRV transmission between individuals with previous exposure to HRV such as older children and adults [25] . It is likely, given the frequent overall exposure to HRV in childcare attendees, that rates of asymptomatic HRV transmission are high in this setting as well. This high rate of detection of HRV among asymptomatic children, coupled with the frequent coinfection with other viruses observed here, highlights the difficulties with determining the role of HRV in causing the common cold. Even though decades of human challenge studies have demonstrated that experimentally administered rhinovirus results in upper respiratory symptoms and transmissible disease, it is nevertheless difficult in observational studies to determine causation following a molecularly detected HRV. While not possible in the context of our study, evaluations of host response [26] [27] [28] to both HRV infection and especially HRV coinfections may present a way forward in understanding this complex system, as it has with studies of the microbiome. We were able to assess the extent to which persistent HRV shedding may be present in children following illness resolution through our sampling collection protocol. In this protocol, collection continued until symptoms were no longer worsening and until swabs were negative by PCR, allowing us to follow HRV infections to resolution. From a total of 92 illnesses in 91 children with HRV sequence data available, only 4 children had repeated detections of the same genotype for longer than 2 consecutive weeks. In contrast, we identified 7 illnesses in which 2 different HRV genotypes were detected within the span of a single illness episode.

For example, it may be that no loss avoidance is achieved at low levels of expenditure (marginal benefit = zero), but that expenditures need to reach a certain threshold for an effect to become noticeable, or that there are increasing marginal benefits at first followed by diminishing marginal benefits (Tisdell 1995) . Such scenarios obviously would lead to different optimal points of disease mitigation, as illustrated by Tisdell (1995) .

Such units can then ""carousel"" Forum strains appear to be responsible for many of the community-acquired MRSA infections occurring in the USA. 17 Most of such strains contain the mobile genetic element staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV, which is relatively uncommon among health-care-associated MRSA strains in the USA. 18 Emergence of community-acquired MRSA has also required that clinicians alter their approach to empiric treatment of community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections. Physicians have been encouraged to routinely culture skin lesions to determine if community-acquired MRSA is the cause, and in geographic areas where community-acquired MRSA are relatively common, empirical therapy of such infections with clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), doxycycline or minocycline, or linezolid is becoming common. If empiric clindamycin is administered, testing community-acquired MRSA isolates for inducible clindamycin resistance by using the ""D-test"" is recommended. 19 By contrast with the Netherlands and some other parts of northern Europe, no standard set of measures has been adopted in all health-care facilities in the USA for controlling transmission of MRSA. Measures recommended by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America for controlling health-care-associated MRSA include the use of screening cultures to detect colonised patients, placing patients in private rooms or cohorting patients, wearing gloves for room entry, gowns for substantial contact with patients or their environment, and hand hygiene before and after patient contact. 20 However, there is considerable debate among experts in the USA about whether or not the use of screening cultures to detect patients at high risk of MRSA is necessary or practical in all health-care settings. Given the considerable body of evidence that screening cultures, when combined with contact precautions, are beneficial and cost-effective, [20] [21] [22] it is disconcerting that a recent survey of infectious disease consultants found that only 50% of 463 respondents favoured the use of screening cultures to detect multidrug-resistant pathogens, and only 30% worked in facilities where screening cultures were routinely done. 23 The costs of surveillance cultures, potential logistic problems that may result from an increased number of patients requiring isolation, and lack of controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of screening cultures are often cited as concerns by those who do not use screening cultures. Further studies are necessary to establish the relative efficacy of control measures such as screening cultures, cohort nursing, increased staffing levels, and improved hand hygiene adherence rates in controlling transmission of MRSA in health-care facilities. 24 At present, there is no consensus regarding which measures are most appropriate for reducing transmission of community-acquired MRSA in community settings and for preventing the spread of these strains in health-care facilities.",31.74050302255882,14.684346217235491

The optimal level can be influenced by two key factors, namely technical changes that lead to an improvement of disease control measures with no price changes and changes in the value of losses avoided relative to the costs of mitigation (Howe et al. 2013) . Consequently, when the value of unpriced negative externalities are taken into account, the total losses increase, which impacts on the optimal point of mitigation as illustrated in Fig. 45.4 . To be able to add the negative externalities, their value must be added to the total losses. Often their value cannot be directly deducted from prices in the conventional sense; instead they must be valued using indirect estimation methods, such as the DALY approach described above. Similarly, the value people place on the welfare of their companion and recreational animals can be estimated for example from how much they spend on veterinary services and medicines. Freedom from fear of infection is more problematical to quantify, but may be revealed by changes in people's normal consumption behaviour. Disease mitigation programmes at national level generally comprise two important components, namely surveillance and intervention. Surveillance is defined as the ""systematic, continuous or repeated, measurement, collection, collation, analysis, interpretation and timely dissemination of animal health and welfare related data from defined populations, essential for describing health hazard occurrence and to contribute to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of risk mitigation measures"" (based on Hoinville et al. 2013) . In other words, surveillance provides information for interventions directed at loss avoidance. Surveillance and intervention are often inextricably linked; they can be technical substitutes or complements (Howe et al. 2013) . The above conceptual basis to define the optimal level for mitigation can then be extended to identify the optimal combination of surveillance and intervention, namely the point where the marginal cost of surveillance and intervention (combined at least cost) equal the marginal benefit (= loss avoidance) on the expansion path (Howe et al. 2013 ). The expansion path (Fig. 45 .5) links all identical tangent points on iso-mitigation curves (along such a curve, the losses avoided are the same for all combinations of surveillance and intervention) with the gradient corresponding to the price ratio for surveillance and intervention. Each point of tangency is a least-cost combination for surveillance and intervention for the given price ratio. If the iso-cost line represents a budget constraint, the surveillance and intervention resources cannot be increased above this level. In Fig. 45 .5, the optimal location on budget line BB' would be at H for A3 avoided losses, although H' would also be a feasible, albeit inferior use of resources. If adding externalities such as negative effects of disease in people, the point H would no longer be optimal and a case would need to be made to increase investment to be able to reach point K (Häsler 2011; Howe et al. 2013) (45.5) .",33.01683290323643,14.196755095644392

In children hospitalized because of respiratory infections, sensitivity of RVI detection with NP aspirates of 86% to 100% have been reported versus nasal swab sensitivity of 67% to 95%. 27 A similar comparison of NP swabs with or without OP swabs in immunocompetent children found a higher sensitivity of NP swabs for RVI of 91% to 100%, which was greater than or equal to OP swabs (83%-98%), with combined testing increasing detection by 2% to 9%, depending on the virus. 28 Investigation in adults reported higher sensitivity with NP washes (85%) than NP swabs (73%) or OP swabs (54%), and noted that maximal sensitivity was achieved through a combination of all 3 methods. 29",36.700886913423126,16.02627245177779

Several measures that facilitate clinical and epidemiological investigation of emerging viral diseases in any environment have been identified (Chan et al. 2017) . Such measures involve rapid detection of viral agents using the most sensitive and specific laboratory assays, including viral antigen and antibody testing, isolation of viral agents using cell and tissue culture techniques, molecular characterization, including nucleic acid synthesis and amplification with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), genotyping and genomic sequencing. The use of quantitative molecular tools such as real-time reverse transcription PCR for enumerating RNA viruses, especially during outbreaks, has helped in the identification of new viral agents (Marston et al. 2014 ). These advanced techniques enable rapid diagnosis and identification of cases and contacts within a short period. The successful detection of an emerging virus may depend on the type of procedure used, and this, in turn, can be determined by economic, human resources and laboratory robustness at the time. Serological techniques, including antigen and antibody testing, involve the use of labelled enzymes and their substrates as indicators in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Whitehouse 2004 ). These methods are inexpensive and used mostly in clinical settings in Africa to detect viruses using serum or plasma obtained from blood. However, because the methods are time-consuming and not sensitive enough to detect occult and early infections, rapid detection of a viral agent may be eluded when using such methods, especially among individuals with nonspecific symptoms of the disease (Whitehouse 2004) .",32.47597033244379,15.047904954966928

However, in most studies upper respiratory tract (URT) samples are used, due mainly to convenience and non-invasiveness [5, 58] . Serological testing methods are also available, including those based on ELISA or immunofluorescence (IFA), traditional microneutralization tests (MNT), and pseudo particle neutralisation tests (ppNT) [5, 35, [59] [60] [61] . Further testing and validation of these tests in the context of mild or asymptomatic disease should help in development of accurate assessments of transmission and fine-tuning of public health policy [5] . More extensive and strategic serosurveys among the human population are needed to understand the extent of levels of MERS-CoV infection, in particular in the absence of severe symptoms [59] [60] [61] .

For example, neutralizing antibodies to common serotypes such as HAdV-5 are found in about 40% of individuals residing in the US and in up to 90% of those living in Sub-Saharan Africa. 43, 44 The prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to HAdV-26, which was initially described as a rare serotype, is low in the US and Europe but high in most African countries. 36 Seroprevalence rates to HAdV-48 were shown to be high only in Africa but low in the US and Asia. 42 HAdV-35 appeared to be a truly rare serotype; less than 20% of sera from children or adults independent of their geographic localization were able to neutralize this virus. 42 Because adenoviruses are species-specific, most humans lack antibodies to those that infect other species, although this depends on the serotype as well as potential contact with the infected species. For examples, we described antibodies to three different chimpanzee adenoviruses (SAdV-23, SAdV-24, and SAdV-25) that were virtually absent in sera from humans residing in the US but that could be detected in up to 20% of individuals from Sub-Saharan Africa. 44, 45 We assumed that this reflected close contact between humans and chimpanzees in Sub-Saharan Africa, where hunting and eating monkeys is common. We subsequently conducted a study in Brazil and again found slightly enhanced prevalence rates of neutralizing antibodies to chimpanzee adenoviruses in humans residing in Brazil; this was especially pronounced in cohorts from Amazonia. Testing of New World monkeys from Brazil showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies to chimpanzee adenoviruses in nearly all sera of common marmosets, which suggested spillover of these viruses from monkeys into the human population. 46 The same viruses tested against sera from different regions in China showed low prevalence rates for high-titer antibodies, although sera with low titers (≤1:40) were found in up to 20% of adults. 47 Another study measured the prevalence rate of neutralizing antibodies in Caucasians residing in the US or Europe against a large panel of chimpanzee adenoviruses of family B, C, and E. The prevalence rate for the chimpanzee-origin adenoviruses with titers greater than 1:200 was in 5% of sera with the exception of SAdV-3-neutralizing antibodies, which was found in about 10% of sera. One of the viruses, CAdV-63, was tested for neutralization by sera from Kenyan children. Sera with high titers of CAdV-63 neutralizing antibodies were rare (approximately 0.5%) whereas low titers were common (17.5%). 48 Preexisting neutralizing antibodies to adenovirus cause rapid uptake of the virions by cells of the reticuloendothelial system. They also lead to activation of complement. 49 Specific neutralizing antibodies prevent cell transduction by adenoviruses and transcription and translation of the transgene product. This results in a reduction of the vaccine antigen and diminishes the vectors' ability to stimulate adaptive immune responses 33, 34, 50 while paradoxically increasing innate responses. 51, 52 The latter presumably reflects that neutralizing antibodies target the vectors to Fc-receptor-positive cells. Binding antibodies or preexisting T cell responses to antigens of adenovirus do not appear to have a major effect on transgene product-specific B or T cell responses. The effect of preexisting neutralizing antibodies can be circumvented by increasing the vaccine dose; this is problematic in humans because, depending on titers of neutralizing antibodies, increases by 100-to 1000-fold are required, 53 which would likely result in unacceptable toxicity. Alternatively, adenovirus vectors could be combined with another vaccine modality such as a DNA vaccine or a poxvirus vector in a so-called prime-boost regimen. [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] Although this is known to increase transgene product-specific immune responses markedly, it also increases the cost and complexity of a vaccine. Repeated use of the same adenovirus vector has been tested to augment immune responses; this is relatively ineffective because neutralizing antibodies induced by the first vaccine dose impair uptake of repeat doses. 59 Loss of transduction in the presence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies can be circumvented by coating viruses with polyethylene glycol 60 or hydrophilic polymers, 61 or encapsidating them into microspheres. 62 It is not yet known whether these approaches also rescue adaptive immune responses to the transgene product. It is also possible to swap variable loops of the hexon of common human serotypes with those of rare human serotypes. 63 We used a straightforward approach by developing vectors that typically fail to infect humans, such as those derived from nonhuman primates. 33, 34 By now a large number of vectors have been isolated from chimpanzees. 48, 64 They are phylogenetically grouped within human serotypes 65 ; their molecular organization, receptor usage, and growth characteristics are similar to those of human serotypes. Antibodies to human serotypes of adenoviruses fail to cross-react with chimpanzee-derived adenoviruses. Most important, as already mentioned, neutralizing antibodies to chimpanzee adenoviruses are only rarely found in humans. Prevalence rates of such antibodies are slightly increased in Africa, presumably owing to closer contact with infected chimpanzees. Chimpanzee adenovirus vectors are thus highly suited as vaccine carriers for use in humans.",28.542236829458115,13.122595175733618

This viral infection is a particular threat to immunocompromised patients who can develop a progressive fulminant form of the disease, which has a high mortality.

Therefore, patients with varicella, those suspected of having varicella or nonimmune patients exposed to varicella 8-21 days after exposure (the shortest and longest possible incubation periods) must be isolated in negative-pressure rooms that do not exhaust back into the hospital. Screening hospital personnel for antibody to varicella virus can pinpoint those individuals who could become infected and, therefore, transmit chickenpox to patients at risk. With varicella vaccine now available, the safest policy for hospital personnel is either to vaccinate all individuals who lack a history of having had chicken pox or who are determined by testing to lack a protective level of antibodies to the virus.",25.942311055253004,13.069473388171712

The mitigation strategies were further subdivided based on parameters such as sensitivity of detection, confi rmation of results, frequency of sampling, number of negative results before reopening for harvesting, and time to action. Direct HAV monitoring resulted in greater risk reduction than did the use of conventional bacterial indicators. In both contamination scenarios, twice monthly virus testing was an effective risk management strategy, avoiding about 40-50 % of the baseline cases. When contamination was accidental and homogeneous, waiting for three negative test results to reopen an area for harvesting was not effective in risk reduction. However, when contamination was endemic, waiting for the three negative test results was effective in preventing human cases. Any control measures that could reduce contamination by at least 2 log 10 units (e.g., improving sanitation, harvesting from lower risk areas) resulted in the greatest risk reduction (87-88 %).

First anti-infectious plasma potein concentrates were the ""standard IgG"" preparations. They were produced by the cold-ethanol fractionation methods and did not make an exception to the above: noninfectious severe AEs occurred while infectious AEs were rarely reported. Indeed, prior to the introduction of mass screening for infection markers of plasma donations, inadvertent transmission of HIV to recipients of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates did occur, while IgG concentrates obtained from the same plasma pool did rarely transmit HIV (Morgenthaler 2001) . Rare transmissions were restricted to products not exposed to low pH. The very few incidences of HIV and some incidences of HCV transmission by IgG concentrates in the early 1990s, together with many cases of coagulation factor concentrates transmitted viral disease, clearly demonstrated the need to establish standardized measures to render plasma products pathogen safe. In the second half of the 1990s, authorities shifted regulatory emphasis from a scientific review of the processes to a focus on compliance to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). The focus on cGMP compliance was applied to all aspects of plasma fractionation and the clinical use of plasma products. Court injunctions and warning letters were the consequences of this paradigm shift by authorities. This in turn resulted in a paradigm shift how the modern plasma industry operates (Steinhardt 1998) .",25.362585731728636,11.142749488288478

However, serosurveillance cannot provide information in a timely manner; thus an outbreak might have occurred that is discovered by serosurveillance, but it might be potentially too late for an intervention to decrease disease transmission. Serosurveillance is sometimes the only type of surveillance conducted for an infectious disease. For example, hepatitis B is frequently asymptomatic in children, making evaluating the impact of vaccination efforts extremely challenging (WHO, 2011) . The standard has become to perform serosurveillance among cohorts of vaccinated children to identify the burden of disease and determine the impact of vaccination efforts. In some countries, national health surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and Malaria Indicator Surveys, are conducted periodically and include a serologic component, allowing one to monitor trends in diseases and immunity over time. For example, NHANES includes data on hepatitis B, C, and D antibodies.",27.682126597749075,13.246987023617235

Specific diagnostic methods should be developed for each of the different stages. (ii) Fast screening of safe and effective drugs. In the face of sudden public health safety incidents, the fastest way is to establish treatments to identify drugs already available in drug libraries since their safety has been proved in clinical trials.

The other possibility is virus spread is inhibited by the neutralizing antibodies, which would mean that budding progeny virions are trapped by neutralizing antibodies before invading adjacent neurons.

In most cases, during the course of an illness, blood samples should be collected at least twice: in the acute phase and during convalescence. Comparison of the antibody pattern in these two states allows safe demonstration of diagnostically significant active virus. Acute-phase blood should be collected as soon as possible after the onset of disease (no later than 1 week), whereas the convalescent sample should be collected at least 2 weeks after onset. These requirements make serologic testing more relevant for epidemiologic studies than for clinical use, because the long delay before a definite diagnosis is made limits its use in urgent decision making in clinical practice. However, in many cases in which rapid methods of antigen detection are inefficient (e.g., RSV detection in adults), serologic testing is considered a reference method; moreover, it remains the method of choice for archival material; for example, it is as sensitive as PCR in detecting influenza infections. 25 Among the five classes of human immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgD), the four IgG subclasses (IgG1-4) have a longer half-life (22 days) than the others and are associated with long-term protection. In addition, IgG antibodies exert their protective role against infection by triggering complement fixation and improve the specificity of the immune response by binding to the surface of cytotoxic effector cells. Most viruses induce mainly IgG1 and IgG3 responses. IgM antibodies represent approximately one tenth of serum immunoglobulins and are the first to be produced after exposure to a foreign antigen.

These isolated human monoclonal antibodies can be used in therapy because of their safety, efficiency, specificity and tolerance in humans; thus are a powerful tool in fighting against pathogens. Among the developed antibody isolation methods over the last decade, it is difficult to highlight one as the sole preferred method. Different methodology has different advantages. Display techniques basing on recombinant library can be used for isolating single domain antibodies with enlarged library size. But this technique cannot provide us the information of the original pair of heavy chain and light chain of a specific antibody. Single B cell sorting and culturing facilitate the rapid cloning of potent neutralizing antibodies with the requirement of large labor cost. Reasonable design of probes and the development of native-like stabilized trimers have greatly improved efficiency in screening of functional envelope-binding B cells.

This policy included deferral of any individual displaying symptoms of infection, quarantine of plasma collected during periods of high mosquito activity (when WNV is most prevalent) and the rapid development/use of WNV-specific NAT and serological assays.

The viral load test had a signifi cant role in early clinical trials of antiviral therapeutics and became an objective measurement tool, even before any protease inhibitors were approved for physician use. Publications on the antiviral therapeutics included the HIV viral load results. Thought leaders who participated in the trials became early adopters of the test, even before the test was FDA approved. The viral load test was put into a kit format and became FDA approved at approximately the same time as the fi rst protease inhibitors became available. Recommendations for viral load testing became part of standard guidelines for treating HIV infection ( Chesebro and Everett, 1998 ) . The theranostic became tied to the use of the drug. Roche's Amplicor Access Program led to rapid test utilization. As volumes increased, manufacturers developed automation. HIV management requires relatively frequent monitoring, as often as four times per year. Therefore, the test was not a ""one off "" test as in constitutional genetic testing. HIV viral load testing also obtained its own CPT code, facilitating reimbursement. Additionally, the kit manufacturer, the national reference labs, patients, and doctors all worked to ensure that the test was reimbursed. These factors helped make HIV viral load testing cost effective and a foundation of HIV prevention efforts. The combination of viral load testing and new therapeutics transformed HIV from a uniformly fatal disease to a chronic treatable disease. Therefore, HIV has become a disease with an ""actionable "" result. Recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations now call for general population screening for HIV status. This example of translating a diagnostic into patient care was successful because so many of the hallmarks of successful diagnostic tests were in place. There was an unmet clinical need, an actionable result was obtained from testing, the test was ultimately cost effective, high-throughput analysis became available, and reimbursement issues were rapidly resolved.",32.18201122678806,14.354562794160064

The effective management of the influenza virus relies on early detection and warning, which are enabled by the use of various nanomaterials. Due to their properties (chemical, physical and electronic), nanomaterials should provide excellent tools for the early detection, early warning and effective treatment of disease threats. The modification of electro-analytical analyser with various nanomaterials will ensure large effective surface areas, high catalytic capabilities and high conductivities using transducers as effective mediators. This strategy will enable the transfer of electrons between the receptor active site and the electrode and rapid AIV detection. The modification of various fluorescent QDs with virusspecific antibodies or oligonucleotides will enable the highly sensitive and rapid detection of antigens (present in samples) using fluorescent readout signals, which can be detected using immunoassays, PCR methods or high resolution microscopy [111] . The simple chemical synthesis of AuNPs and possibilities for surface modification with different molecules, such as peptides, proteins, DNA and antibodies, should provide researchers additional opportunities to improve virus detection in the future. Due to their surface plasmon resonance properties, AuNPs aggregate, which leads to colour changes in solution the potential for the rapid and simple detection of influenza viruses [112] . Moreover, aptamers are considered future materials due to their unique structures and ability to be synthesized for specific molecules, which will promote improvements in detection methods. The modification of aptamers with various types of fluorescence molecules represents an easy method to detect AIVs using surface plasmon resonance.

Amniocentesis is offered only if specific risk factors, the most significant of which is maternal age, are present. While these errors might seem insignificant, in light of the difficulty individuals have in understanding genetic testing 16 and the nature of a screening test as opposed to a diagnostic test (particularly in the context of prenatal testing), the errors have the potential to create misunderstanding. It is easy to see how the decision of a woman who had seen this or similar information prior to, or even in conjunction with, discussing prenatal testing with her physician might be ""negatively influenced."" She might decide to go ahead with the MSAFP but not amniocentesis, regardless of the results of the MSAFP testing, because of her understanding that both tests provide essentially the same information and that amniocentesis carries more significant risks to her fetus.

Likewise, social and health policy, information and containment measures are based on what has been learned from previous epidemics, in order to optimize the current measures. From the epidemiology of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in China we have learned how fundamental are measures such as early recognition of the problem, strict infection control and identification of infected patients, isolation measures, inclusion and formation of new medical and sanitary staff in the health system, designation of new hospital wards with appropriate equipment and information through the mass and social media [14] . As part of these measures, recently, the Italian Society of Rheumatology has proposed a set of practical recommendations to improve the management of CoViD-19 patients and to decrease the risk of acquiring this infection in particular in rheumatic patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapies (Table 1 ). In general, the interruption of therapies used in rheumatic patients is not advised, as it may be responsible for the onset of clinical flares of the rheumatic disease with subsequent use of other immunosuppressants such as oral glucocorticoids that may be equally unsafe for patients in case of acquired CoViD-19. Although the data are at present unavailable, it appears important to maintain chronic therapies and to have a strict control of each patient in order to evaluate specific clinical needs. In fact, the infection risk in rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis is also related to disease activity and a flare due to therapy discontinuation would confer a higher risk of infection [23] .",30.058281887525784,13.759050985310537

The role of serology in the viral diagnosis of the cell cultures may be to determine the immune status of donors of biological materials. It is important to use sensitive assays, such as EIA, immunofluorescence, Western blot assays, etc. However, research has shown that the detection of antibodies exclusively runs the risk of samples for tests being taken during an antibody-negative window period of these infections, where an individual has been exposed to viral infection and indeed can be viremic (Hitzler and Runkel, 2001) . This finding has led to the introduction of nucleic acid amplification techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which the presence of a virus can be observed by means of the amplification of sequences in the viral genome. The addition of nucleic acid test methods to screening of tissue donors, and to the testing of derived cell lines, should reduce the risk of these infections among recipients of stem cell lines (Zou et al., 2004) .",27.4474402054882,13.698963161772248

This result would also be desired for a CHIKV vaccine, since after the acute CHIKV infection phase, persistent polyarthritis frequently occurs in patients. Laboratory diagnosis of viral infection is usually confined to the detection of virus-specific antibodies in the blood, detection of virus antigens or detection of viral genetic material. However, these assays are limited and to provide functional data unable. For instance, nucleic acid amplification can only be used in the viremic phase during CHIKV infections. To determine the neutralizing activity of antibodies or drugs, conventional neutralization assays, like a plaque reduction assay or the inhibition of cytopathogenic effects, are time consuming and rely on the use of fully infectious human pathogens and a reliable reference stock of the virus. Efforts to improve these methods have been described recently. A neutralization assay based on CHIKV replicons expressing secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) as read-out was recently described. The authors showed convincing data with neutralizing antisera of CHIKV infected patients in a 24-well and 96-well format (Glasker et al., 2013) . However the production of replicons requires an in vitro transcription and electroporation steps that may resemble technical hurdles. In addition, replicons still bear some residual danger of recombination and the generation of fully replicating CHIKV, although the readout of luciferase in the supernatant of cells is a benefit and omits cell lysis. A second novel approach uses pseudotyped lentiviral vector particles (Kishishita et al., 2013) . Here the vector particles needed to be purified by sucrose cushion centrifugation and the assay format was 24-well based. The assay was performed manually and in total took 5 days. Therefore, the method described here, to detect neutralizing activities using pseudotyped lentiviral vector particles in a high-throughput format is a further improvement. This semi-automated neutralization assay for CHIKV was established by using pseudotyped vector particles and the quantitation of luciferase activity. This assay has several advantages to other neutralization assays. It can be performed at a lower biosafety level (S2), thus does not require handling of a human S3 pathogen. Finally, an automated performance of the assay, including the seeding of target cells, makes it fast (3 days) and convenient for the development of entry inhibitors of CHIKV by high throughput screening by using pin tools with specific liquid handling high throughput screening equipment. In addition, the assay will also be helpful for CHIKV vaccine development to screen large numbers of serum samples during clinical trials, in an easy to perform, functional assay. Fast detection of neutralizing or cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies will speed up CHIKV and possibly other Alphavirus vaccine developments and might be useful for basic research to study Alphavirus-specific neutralizing immune responses during large outbreaks.",27.889505388460247,13.499008048318416

However, neutralizing antibodies against the major structural component, GP5, appear later than non-neutralizing antibodies induced by other structural proteins and nsp2 after PRRSV infection. As a consequence, infected pigs do not efficiently resolve virus infection at the early phase (Lopez and Osorio, 2004) . There are three possible explanations for the delayed appearance of neutralizing antibodies. First, GP5 contains an immunodominant epitope (epitope A or ""decoy"" epitope) in its ectodomain inducing an early and strong nonneutralizing immune response that diminish or mask the immune responses elicited by a downstream nearby neutralizing epitope (epitope B) Ostrowski et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2000) . Secondly, there exist high mannose glycans at the N-linked glycosylation sites flanking epitope B on GP5 that diminish the sensitivity of PRRSV virions to neutralizing antibodies and thus impair the immunogenicity of the nearby epitope B Faaberg et al., 2006; Plagemann et al., 2002) . Thirdly, PRRSV employ various strategies to inhibit the initial innate immune responses, in particular, the production of type I IFN, which subsequently dampens the host adaptive immune responses including the humoral immune response (Mateu and Diaz, 2008; Murtaugh et al., 2002; Royaee et al., 2004) .

However, the variation in reported sensitivity and specificity makes it difficult for the RT-PCR to be considered the standard criterion for early diagnosis. Moreover, the best time for a high sensitivity for nasopharyngeal aspirate sampling was on days 8 to 10 after the onset of symptoms (18) or later (1) . Waiting 8 to 10 days to make a firm diagnosis or to plan for appropriate therapy is not possible. Since it is important to diagnose and confirm SARS within the first few days of illness, we studied the N protein as an early diagnostic marker in 325 patients with serologically confirmed SARS-CoV infection. Using the antigen capture ELISA, we were able to demonstrate the presence of the N protein in some serum samples as early as day 1 and up to day 18 ( Fig. 1) , and nearly all sera were found positive for the N protein between days 3 and 5. The detection rates for the N protein of SARS-CoV in serum specimens showed a much higher percentage in blood during the first week of the illness than in subsequent weeks. The N protein in blood, therefore, is considered a good diagnostic marker during the early stage of the SARS-CoV infection. Since the N protein appears relatively stable to freezing and thawing and is stable for many months frozen at Ϫ20°C, detection of the N protein in serum samples retrospectively did not seem to affect the overall detection rate. In contrast, the storage of the specimens at Ϫ70°C, which is essential for RT-PCR in order to maintain viral RNA in optimal conditions, is not feasible in many nonresearch laboratories. In addition, the use of serum specimens for diagnosing SARS-CoV infection has the advantage of not requiring respiratory specimens, including sputum, nasopharyngeal aspiration, and endotracheal tube samples, which are regarded as a risk to health care workers.",31.07086260073829,14.299785065985787

General Hospital for antibiotics additional to those begun on October 21. Serum samples were obtained from 202 individuals, and all were negative for specific IgG antibody to the PA IgG, including the three participants who reported a remote history of anthrax vaccination. Limitations to this data are the fact that antibiotics were begun before serum testing, and there were no baseline serum samples available for testing. Also, the time period from exposure to sampling was very short. Among 28 individuals with positive nasal swabs in the Capitol exposures who received antibiotics immediately, none had a positive culture from a nasal swab repeated 7 days later, and none had positive serum IgG to PA antigen 42 days after exposure. This again emphasizes the limitation and interpretation of a test in someone who had early antibiotic treatment. It does raise forensic considerations. Even with this easily disseminated strain, an antibody response may be aborted or modified with antibiotics by early eradication. Furthermore, antibiotics taken prior to exposure would likely be effective in preventing laboratory and clinical signs of an infection or exposure.

Challenged by the reality that earlier opportunities had been missed, China launched a costly public health response in Wuhan, which involved many tactics besides isolation of cases and contacts, including lockdown of the city and mass quarantine, social distancing mandates, school closures, and intense case finding and contact tracing by the medical and public health professionals who were mobilised across the country to come to Wuhan. [2] [3] [4] The approach in Wuhan and the nearby cities in Hubei Province took exceptional measures in response to the outbreak, because there was evidence of high-level community transmission and widespread nosocomial infections. 5 As of Feb 11, 2020, 3019 COVID-19 cases among health workers had been reported, with at least five deaths. 5,6 In many regions outside of China, decision makers and the medical community still have the opportunity of early detection and response. 2 The Article by Hellewell and colleagues gives us a clearer sense of how quickly the window for early response is closing: when the number of initial cases increases to 40, the probability of failure to control is high, at 80% even with 80% of contacts traced and isolated. Based on the early experience in Wuhan, the number of COVID-19 cases could increase from 20 to 40 cases within 3 days (from Jan 6-8, 2020), and outbreak sizes doubled in every 7·4 days on average, highlighting the urgency of early detection and rapid response. 7 In Hellewell and colleagues' model, transmission before symptoms, even when the percentage is moderate, at 15-30%, had a marked effect on probability to control. 1 Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, where almost all onward transmissions occur after symptom onset, 8 we now know that transmission of COVID-19 virus can occur before symptom onset. In the fifth version of Chinese guidelines governing contact tracing, it defined close contacts as ""those who have been in close contact since 2 days before the onset of symptoms in suspected and confirmed cases, or 2 days prior to an asymptomatic confirmed case,"" which reflects our current understanding that secondary transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible at least 2 days before symptom onset. 9 However, the efficiency of transmission remains uncertain, and seroprevalence studies among different contacts will be important. Transmission by people with no or mild symptoms can dampen the power of the isolation strategy because of reduced likelihood of isolating all cases and tracing all contacts. The identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by health care and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing, and isolation of suspected cases with no or mild disease (eg, influenza-like illness).",31.642936632153663,13.992954585742002

Diagnostic tests available for ZIKV include NAATs for viral RNA, serologic evaluation for IgM antibodies to the virus, and PRNTs, considered the reference standard for detection of neutralizing antibodies to arboviruses (Table 71 ). Selection between these methodologies (ie, NAAT vs serology) is primarily dependent on when the patient presents in relation to symptom onset or last possible exposure to ZIKV [287] . Currently, the CDC recommends molecular testing by NAAT on serum and urine in symptomatic patients and pregnant women with illness duration of 14 days or less. While a positive NAAT result for ZIKV is diagnostic for infection, a negative result does not exclude infection as viremia or viruria may have passed by the time the specimen was collected. Patients negative by NAAT, particularly pregnant women, for whom ZIKV infection remains in the differential, should be evaluated using a serologic assay for antibodies to the virus.

Furthermore, enhanced disease has not been reported in respiratory tissues or in GI tissues, which are the primary sites of viral replication in SARS-CoV infection. In a single set of experiments (Weingartl et al., 2004a) , ferrets were immunized with MVA-SARS-S via interperitoneal and subcutaneous routes with 10 8 pfu of vaccine per ferret at day 0, boosted with the same regimen at day 14, and challenged intranasally with 10 6 pfu/ferret of SARS-CoV (Tor2) at day 28. MVA-SARS-S vaccinated ferrets demonstrated low levels of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV 1 week after the booster immunization (i.e. day 21; titer 1:40 or less). Strangely, neutralizing antibodies in this group were not detectable at day 28 (<1:20), prior to challenge and no significant difference was observed in the level of virus detected in pharyngeal swabs from animals vaccinated with MVA-SARS-S and control animals following challenge with SARS-CoV. Foci of hepatic necrosis were observed in MVA-SARS-S-vaccinated animals and to a lesser extent, in animals immunized with the MVA vector alone or PBS. It is unclear why the MVA-SARS-S vaccine was so poorly immunogenic (indicated by low level and transient detection of neutralizing antibodies) in ferrets since a similar vaccine was immunogenic and efficacious in mice and NHPs. It is also unclear why a memory antibody response was observed in MVA-SARS-S-immunized animals but was unable to neutralize virus or clear virus from these ferrets any faster than virus was cleared from mock-immunized ferrets. The possibility of co-pathogens as a cause for hepatitis was not examined, and it is possible that co-pathogens might have played a role in the observations reported in these ferrets. It is also possible that the observed phenomenon may be limited to a specific vector (MVA) or animal model (ferrets). Finally, although elevated levels of liver enzymes following SARS-CoV infection have been reported in human cases of SARS, hepatitis was rarely if ever reported in SARS patients (Z. . Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the findings of hepatitis in ferrets and to determine if these findings have any relevance to the possibility of disease enhancement in SARS-vaccinated animals.

Current techniques include culture, antigen detection, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Culturing atypical bacteria is time-intensive and technically difficult. Other methods for detection include enzyme immunoassays (EIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and microimmunofluorescence. 3 For C pneumoniae, detection of IgM antibodies typically at 2 to 3 weeks after infection or a fourfold increase in IgG antibodies in convalescent sera suggests acute infection. For M pneumoniae, the EIA is frequently used to compare acute and convalescent sera looking for a fourfold increase in antibody titers. PCR detection of atypical bacteria is more sensitive, but there is a lack of standardization and availability. In addition, the correlation between these different diagnostic tests is fairly low. 12 A definitive diagnosis may require invasive tissue sampling, which is infrequently performed. Due to the lack of standardized tests and discordance between detection methodologies, there are limitations in the ability to accurately detect atypical bacterial infections of the lung, which subsequently affects the conclusions that can be drawn from available studies evaluating the role of atypical bacteria and asthma.

In addition, installation of and training on new testing platforms allowed for harmonization of protocols for selected pathogens across the regional institutes' laboratories. Review of the National Laboratory Strategic Plan developed under PEPFAR confirmed it to be an important framework with relevance to public health laboratories and highlighted the importance to GHS of quality management systems (8) . As a result of the project, CDC and MoH engaged in a substantive dialog about a broader set of pathogens for early detection and rapid response. EOC, with the enhancements of necessary procedures and equipment, will serve as a working body to assist the National Steering Committee on Emerging Disease Control and Prevention.

However, to make sensible projections of the total expected mortality from novel infectious diseases, we need to move beyond hospital case fatality rates towards infection fatality rates that explicitly use the number of infections as the denominator. Estimating this quantity is challenging if many infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild illness. One possible solution is to use serology to estimate numbers infected; this was deployed in Hong Kong during the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 epidemic (Riley et al., 2011) , though challenges could arise from unknown background seroprevalence and delayed availability of serological data. An alternative is to estimate total numbers of infections from analyses of pathogen sequence data, which is possible in principle during the exponential phase of an outbreak (Frost and Volz, 2010) . Since pathogen sequences are often deposited in the public domain in real time during pandemics this might provide very early estimates of the numbers of infections, including those that are asymptomatic. Mathematical modelling could clarify what can be expected from such an approach. Given the numerous assumptions involved, would estimates of the numbers infected ever be accurate enough to make this approach useful? How many sequences are needed? Could we correct for sampling bias and heterogenous transmission? (see the challenges in phylodynamic inference, in this volume, Frost et al., 2015) . With the widespread availability of viral sequence from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and a 'gold standard' estimate of infection rates from published serology, that event could be a testing ground for new methods for calculating infection rates and thus infection fatality rates.",33.302087661541734,15.913295738817286

Assay systems that will determine the suitabiHty of MAbs for this intended appHcation should be developed and optimized, so they can be used for testing culture supernatants as early as possible during the hybridoma production process. Many researchers screen hybridoma culture supernatants using microtitre ELISA systems. Though microtitre ELISA is a simple and convenient screening method, it will detect only MAbs that bind to target antigen coated on to a microtitre plate. Owing to their unique specificity and properties, the MAbs detected in this way may not be suitable for use in other applications. They may not, for example, react with native antigen in immunohistopathology (immunocytochemistry), with antigen in solution in sandwich (capture) ELISAs, or irreversibly bind antigen when acting as an immunoadsorbent. An example of this phenomenon was described by Thiriart et al (1986) , who had difficulty in obtaining neutralizing MAbs against bovine rotavirus when using an ELISA system for screening hybridoma supernatants. His group therefore developed a rapid sensitive rotavirus neutralization assay and adopted it for direct screening of primary hybridoma supernatants. Using this assay, they obtained more than 70 neutralizing MAbs from one fusion, which gave negative results when tested by their original ELISA for detecting rotavirus antibodies.",33.23316733756422,15.238999281839188

Intragovernmental collaboration (with cross-sectoral inputs) is also essential to the development of climate adaptation and resilience indicators. 10 Incentives for health professionals to engage with climate change and other environmental change issues are limited but could be developed out on a health systems level, including through collaboration integrated into existing health frameworks. The International Health Regulations (IHR) of the WHO, now in its second edition, represents the main governance mechanism to promote public health security of member countries. Primarily focused on reporting and response at a country level to aid in preparedness, the capacity established by the IHR could be expanded to include proactive approaches. Updates to the IHR could focus on disease prevention through risk reduction, including public and community engagement and health education, and closer integration with environmental, agricultural, and other sectors to encourage multidisciplinary understanding and solutions. Most directly, for a number of diseases with strong links to climate and weather, such as RVF, close working relationships between national and local public health and weather services, as well as agricultural or wildlife entities where sentinel monitoring may be possible, can help improve forecasting to enable risk-reduction strategies.

By contrast, because of the technical difficulties in expressing the full-length protein in bacteria, only fragments were used in ELISAs and WB analysis. In general, antibodies directed against the S protein appeared later in infection than those directed against the N protein (Tan et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) , indicating that S protein-based assays may be preferable for use with convalescent sera. Overall, reactivity of SARS patient sera with S protein differed grossly between different studies and types of assays, ranging from very low (13%) in one study (Leung et al., 2004) to 100% in several other studies (Table 2) . There was a marked difference between detection rates with IFAs (100%), ELISAs (13-96%) and WB analysis (40-100%) ( Table 2 ).

For glycoprotein 120 (gp120) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it was shown that altered glycosylation patterns influence the host immune response (Grundner et al., 2004) . Therefore patients that produce mainly antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes or glycosylation-dependent epitopes of the S protein could be tested as false negatives in an ELISA or WB analysis. That ELISAs and WB analysis are only able to use S protein fragments, as mentioned above, provides a plausible explanation for the variable results found between different assays.",32.663731112464845,14.381951098675135

Colostrum-derived antibodies make the detection of persistently BVDV-infected neonatal calves cumbersome and expensive. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples from neonatal calves as a method for the early detection of persistent BVDV infection. Three hundred thirty-two 1-to 4-week-old dairy calves were screened for BVDV as part of a routine control program. Formalin-fixed skin biopsy samples were stained for BVDV antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the results were compared to those of virus isolation (VI) from white blood cell preparations. Six calves were positive by both IHC and VI and remained positive for BVDV upon subsequent follow-up testing; thus, they were classified as persistently infected with BVDV. One calf was positive by VI but negative by IHC. On subsequent testing, the calf was negative by VI, suggesting that the initial VI result was due to an acute BVDV infection. One calf was positive by IHC but negative by VI. This calf remained negative by VI on follow-up testing. Immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples is a reliable method for screening neonatal calves for persistent BVDV infection and would be a useful management tool as an aid for controlling and preventing BVDV infection.",30.899818744757763,14.312360018764583

Those methods are simple and rapid for clinical use. However, they are still not suitable for use outside the research laboratory because of the requirement of special equipment such as a microplate reader or incubator. A RAPId Neutralizing Antibody (RAPINA) test has been described for quantitatively measuring neutralizing antibody against rabies virus (Shiota et al., 2009) . In this method, serum is incubated with inactivated rabies virus, and then used for a RABV G detection kit based on the principle of immunochromatography as described previously (Nishizono et al., 2008) . In comparison with ELISAs, the RAPINA has an advantage of convenience, safety and rapidity. No special equipment, cultured cells, live virus, or trained operators are needed, and the results are easy to read. Sera with virus neutralizing antibody titers ≥ 0.5 IU/ml could neutralize the rabies virus and would not produce a test line; however, sera with titers < 0.5 IU/ml would not inhibit the band formation on the test line when detected by the RABV G detection kit. In the ICTS, 50 l serum sample was applied to the test, two red-purple lines on the membrane indicate that the serum sample possesses a virus neutralizing antibody titer ≥ 0.5 IU/ml. If only one line appears at the control location, the serum sample is negative for rabies virus or has a virus neutralizing antibody titer < 0.5 IU/ml. Also, the stronger the test line appears, the more virus specific antibodies are present in the sample. It should be pointed out that one disadvantage of ICTS is that the intensity of the test lines could reach to a plateau when test the serum samples with titers higher than 8.0 IU/ml. This is because the amounts of colloidal gold-RABV G dispensed onto the fiberglass and Staphylococcal protein A immobilized on the membrane are constant, and even though more virus neutralizing antibodies are present in the sample, the colloidal gold-RABV G-RABV antibody complex trapped by the Staphylococcal protein A immobilized at the test line is limited, so the color cannot become stronger.

Recently, detection in serum of circulating autoantibodies targeting Tumor-Associated Antigens (TAAs) has emerged as an effective approach for identifying cancer early detection markers (e.g. breast, lung and ductal pancreatic cancer [5, 80, 102] ). This approach is based on the fact that the immune system produces an-tibodies against abnormal/mutated proteins generated from apoptotic/necrotic cancer cells. These autoantibodies can then be detected with immunosorbant assays like ELISA. Because the levels/stability of autoantibodies are potentially much greater than those of the original autoantigens, they would be more easily detected. By comparing autoantibody profiles between different groups (cancer patients versus controls), it is possible to identify markers that are significantly differentially expressed. This method is expected to be superior to DNA array-based methods since changes in RNA expression levels do not necessarily correlate with protein expression.",27.186759098656232,13.150763726731675

BoNTs are among the most toxic substances known with an estimated human lethal dose of 1 ng/kg body weight. (1) Naturally occurring botulism transpires from the ingestion of contaminated food or the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by BoNT-producing clostridia. However, the relative ease of production and the lethality of all the BoNT subtypes has resulted in their inclusion on the Category A Select Agents and Toxins list. (1) Furthermore, mass vaccination against BoNTs is unlikely due to the rarity of the naturally occurring disease, the limited availability and crudeness of the current pentavalent vaccine, and the subsequent inability to use BoNT therapy in vaccines. (1) Neutralizing antibodies have been observed to be protective against toxin challenge. Indeed, polyclonal therapies against BoNT include human immunoglobulin for infant botulism (BoNT serotypes A and B) and equine immunoglobulin for adult botulism (BoNT serotypes A, B, and E). (1, 2) In addition, a despeciated investigational heptavalent antitoxin (HBAT), which contains antibodies to all seven known BoNT serotypes, has recently become available to treat adult botulism. (3) (4) (5) The potential severity and lethality of botulism poisoning require that a patient presenting clinical symptoms receive antitoxin in a timely manner, before receiving a definitive diagnosis. (2, 6, 7) To date, the gold standard to detect BoNT in clinical samples is the mouse toxicity assay. While both sensitive and specific, this assay takes up to 96 h to complete and requires specialized personnel, facility, and reagent resources. (8) Due to adverse patient reactions that can occur and batch variation in polyclonal immunoglobulin production, it is desirable to develop rapid methods of diagnosis that permit accurate and sensitive BoNT detection and serotyping capability to ensure the correct course of treatment is initiated as soon as possible. Many efforts have been made to develop alternative, immunologically based assays for BoNT detection in clinical samples, yet these assays are often limited by the availability of high-quality antibodies. (8) The production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against BoNTs is an excellent choice for several reasons. First, MAbs are consistent between lots. Second, they are well defined and are theoretically in unlimited supply. Mammalian cell lines scale up readily and provide a means to produce clinical grade material. Third, murine hybridomas with bioactivity provide good lead molecules that can be modified by recombinant means for improved bioactivity and/or less immunogenicity, the latter, for example, by simple chimerization strategies.",25.606145216356907,11.78546806739362

The duration of antibiotics and proportion with early discontinuation were compared between patients testing positive and negative for viruses by POCT, and controls. Patients testing positive for viruses by POCT were compared according to virus types. Results: 118 patient with exacerbation of airways disease received antibiotics in the POCT group and 111 in the control group. In the POCT group 49/118 (42%) patients tested positive for viruses.

Using this method it was possible to measure simultaneously the frequency of memory B cells relative to the clonable B cells and to define the fine specificity, cross-reactivity and neutralizing capacity of the antibodies produced, while excluding artefacts due to the presence of polyspecific antibodies [34] . Several observations were made. First, in the MV-and influenza-immune donors analyzed, the memory B cells that produced virus-neutralizing antibodies were a small fraction (4-25%) of those producing antibodies binding to viral antigens detected by ELISA. This difference is particularly striking if we consider that the neutralization assay detects by definition the entire spectrum of neutralizing specificities while the ELISA assay may underestimate the frequency of B cells making binding antibodies due to the limited representation of some viral antigens in their native or denatured conformation. It is possible that some neutralizing antibodies may have been undetected because of insufficient antibody concentration. The fact that similar proportions of neutralizing memory B cells were obtained in parallel experiments using polyclonal stimulation of PBMC and isolation of EBV-immortalized B cell clones (DC, data not shown) suggests that the polyclonal stimulation method is suitable to detect most in vitro neutralizing antibodies. It is perhaps not surprising that only a fraction of antigen-specific memory B cells makes neutralizing antibodies if one considers that the neutralizing epitopes are only a fraction of all viral epitopes. The role of memory B cells that produce non-neutralizing antibodies remains to be established. While it is possible that some of these antibodies may restrict viral replication by indirect mechanisms [35, 36] , it is also possible that they may play no role or even a detrimental role by enhancing immune pathology [37, 38] .",29.551387646024594,14.82454814749838

Multiplexed molecular methods have been implemented for routine use in many clinical laboratories because of the methods' sensitivity, speed (more rapid than culture), ability to detect viruses that are difficult or impossible to culture, and ability to detect multiple viruses simultaneously. These assays are of high complexity and require a capital expenditure that may not be feasible for all laboratories. A testing algorithm that incorporates several methods may be the best strategy, but it is vital to consult all end-user groups, including medical staff, nursing, and administration, before implementation. The algorithm design would depend on the type of institution, patient demographics, how the information is going to be used for patient care, viral prevalence or seasonality in the area, whether detection of multiple viruses is important, how many viruses should be targeted, assay turn-around time, and if isolates are required for susceptibility testing. One such algorithm might be that more rapid but less sensitive antigen detection tests would be used first. This might be particularly useful in geographical regions with a high prevalence of the viruses detected by these tests. Positive results using these rapid tests would be reported and testing of those samples would stop. Samples with negative results would be tested with more sensitive assays, such as FA. Samples negative by FA would be tested by molecular diagnostics. Another algorithm might have FA as the first line of testing. Some laboratories might opt to run a multiplexed assay for those viruses considered treatable, of high clinical impact, or of high seasonal prevalence (such as influenza and RSV), while other laboratories might use a highly multiplexed assay that targets all available respiratory viral targets.",31.38366427200051,14.483505024134658

The active components in the serum were described as ""antibodies"" ""antitoxins"" and ""magic bullets"" (Ehrlich, 1908; Winau et al., 2004) . This crude ""serum therapy"" was later modified by isolating antibodies from the serum for the treatment of infectious and immune diseases, known as intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) (Stangel and Pul, 2006 ). Despite the early success of serum therapy and IVIG treatment, no significant progress was made in therapeutic antibody discovery and development until César Milstein and Georges Köhler developed methods for isolating mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from hybridoma cells in 1975 (Köhler and Milstein, 1975) . Since then, mAbs have not only fueled breakthrough discoveries in basic research, but have also been developed as clinical diagnostics, reagents for high throughput drug screening, and more importantly, life-saving medicines. The first therapeutic mAb murononab, a murinederived antibody for acute organ rejection, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986, a decade after the discovery of the mouse hybridoma technology (Thistlethwaite et al., 1987) . As a result of technological breakthroughs in the 1980s and 1990s, progress in therapeutic mAbs field has been accelerated. Therapeutic antibodies have shown desirable safety profiles, high target specificity and affinity, and efficiency in disrupting protein/ protein interactions. They are becoming a major drug modality with more than 25 therapeutic antibodies in clinical use and hundreds more in development (Reichert and Valge-Archer, 2007; ).",31.540118211933034,13.330548689812243

Lober et al. [5] provide a good description of the information sources that can be monitored to detect an outbreak as early as possible. Where affected people present may depend on the type of disease and on the organisation of the healthcare service. In Norway, which has a system of personal general practitioners (GPs) with gatekeeper functions to secondary and tertiary levels of care, patients will typically consult their GP or the casualty clinic in the first instance. Patients are only likely to present at a hospital emergency unit if they are acutely ill (for example, if they have been injured in an accident, or referred to the casualty clinic by the GP). A telephone survey in the USA, in New York, showed that 29.1% of persons with influenzalike illness (ILI) visited a physician, 21.4% called a physician for advice, 8.8% visited the emergency department, and 3.8% called a nurse or health hotline [6] . The EHR systems used by GPs are therefore likely to be very good sources for detecting disease outbreaks in a healthcare context where most people normally consult their GP in the first instance if they get ill. However, using patient data stored in the EHR system is difficult because of the privacy issues involved in exporting data from the EHR systems [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",28.74131057495193,13.11045735321453

Take, for example, the transboundary threats posed by some of the world's most dangerous pathogens for which few or no medical countermeasures exist, and the impact these threats have both at the substantive and the emotional arena of policy. When contagious epidemics arise in various countries, there is an increasing possibility that infected travelers will spread the disease. The design of the primary mitigation strategy to reduce this risk revolves around exit/entry screening of all persons at international borders for unexplained symptoms of illness which may be associated with the disease. This policy design, recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO 2003 (WHO , 2014 , focuses on those individuals at the highest risk, traveling to and from those countries at highest risk, and involves a combination of screening, quarantine, isolation and communications. However, when contagious epidemics arise, the derived public fears and panic may pose a problem which may be equally, if not more, important than the substantive one. The need faced by policymakers to reduce public fears and panic often leads them to adopt exit/entry screening although it is common (professional) knowledge that these measures are ineffective at detecting infectious persons and involve intensive use of resources and relatively high opportunity costs, financially and in terms of the use of scarce public health staff resources during a time of high need (Selvey et al. 2015, 197) . For example, during the SARS outbreak of 2003, despite the institution of a combination of border measures in Australia, Canada, and Singapore, no confirmed SARS cases were detected (Selvey 2015, 199) . During the influenza pandemic of 2009, of the influenza cases that might have been acquired during travel overseas, only 12.9 % (15/ 116) were detected in Singapore as a result of border screening, and in Japan 6.6 % (10/ 151), in New South Wales, Australia 6.7 % (3/45), and in Auckland, New Zealand 5.8 % (4/69) (Selvey et al. 2015, 198) .

Therefore, accurate, cost-effective, reliable diagnostic assays (preferably those which can be used in the field) are needed to impact on the incidence of the various STIs, as well as HIV. With the advent of molecular technologies, including target and signal amplification methods, diagnoses of STIs have been revolutionised and allow the use of non or minimally invasive sampling techniques, some of which are self-collected by the patient, e.g. first-void urine, cervico-vaginal lavage, low vaginal swabs, and tampons. Most studies evaluating such self-sampling with molecular diagnostic techniques have demonstrated an equivalent or superior detection of STIs as compared to conventional sampling and detection methods.

A protocol for the use of convalescent plasma as a therapeutic option for MERS was suggested [61] . Plasma donors were identified as those with anti-MERS-CoV indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) antibodies (titer of ≥1:160) with no evidence of active MERS-CoV infection [61] . In nine confirmed survivors of MERS-CoV infection, 55%, 33%, and 22% of them had positive MERS antibodies by IFA at 3, 10, and 18 months, respectively [62] . The two patients who had long lasting antibodies had severe disease; however, the titer of the IFA antibodies was not measured in the study [62] . In a larger study, MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were produced at low levels and were short-lived [63] . Further studies of the kinetics of the MERS-CoV antibodies showed that all surviving patients and 50% of fatal cases produced IgG and neutralizing antibodies [64] . The presence of antibodies did not lead to the elimination of virus from the lower respiratory tract [64] . In a study of 12 patients from South Korea, nine patients had PRNT50 titers >1:320 by day 21 and two had titers >1:320 by day 28 [65] . In a study of 443 samples, 12 (2.7%) had reactive ELISA results, and 9 of those had reactive indirect fluorescent antibody and microneutralization assay titers [66] . Thus, the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of MERS-CoV in a clinical trial may be challenging due to a small pool of potential donors with sufficient antibody titers [66] .",30.355710549455544,13.357909503733694

After infection, only a few viruses release antigens in amounts suffi cient to be detectable in body fl uids by antibody assays (ELISAs). The presence of antibodies indicates immunity of the human organism in most virus infections, whereas re-infections do not show any symptoms. Antibody generation is detectable shortly after disease breaks out (e.g., in patients with viral hepatitis), but not during the highly infectious incubation time. Diagnosis of infections by cytopathogenic viruses, such as infl uenza or respiratory infections, may be easily performed in late states of these diseases, but are hardly possible during early disease states. While serotyping of viruses is mostly done by conventional immunological methods, many clinical isolates remain unclassifi able due to the limited number of antibodies against virus surface proteins, for example, of enteroviruses.

However, the variation in reported sensitivity and specificity makes it difficult for the RT-PCR to be considered the standard criterion for early diagnosis. Moreover, the best time for a high sensitivity for nasopharyngeal aspirate sampling was on days 8 to 10 after the onset of symptoms (18) or later (1) . Waiting 8 to 10 days to make a firm diagnosis or to plan for appropriate therapy is not possible. Since it is important to diagnose and confirm SARS within the first few days of illness, we studied the N protein as an early diagnostic marker in 325 patients with serologically confirmed SARS-CoV infection. Using the antigen capture ELISA, we were able to demonstrate the presence of the N protein in some serum samples as early as day 1 and up to day 18 ( Fig. 1) , and nearly all sera were found positive for the N protein between days 3 and 5. The detection rates for the N protein of SARS-CoV in serum specimens showed a much higher percentage in blood during the first week of the illness than in subsequent weeks. The N protein in blood, therefore, is considered a good diagnostic marker during the early stage of the SARS-CoV infection. Since the N protein appears relatively stable to freezing and thawing and is stable for many months frozen at Ϫ20°C, detection of the N protein in serum samples retrospectively did not seem to affect the overall detection rate. In contrast, the storage of the specimens at Ϫ70°C, which is essential for RT-PCR in order to maintain viral RNA in optimal conditions, is not feasible in many nonresearch laboratories. In addition, the use of serum specimens for diagnosing SARS-CoV infection has the advantage of not requiring respiratory specimens, including sputum, nasopharyngeal aspiration, and endotracheal tube samples, which are regarded as a risk to health care workers.",31.65428948380616,14.503984475059543

The simulation model was robust against variations in many of these parameters, but there were considerable differences in outcome with some variations, such as early detection of initial exposure.

Thereby, pandemic mitigation has to be done amidst a limited knowledge of disease and population dynamics, constrained infrastructure, shortage of effective clinical treatments, and to-be-proven resource allocation policies. This challenge, faced during the recent H1N1 outbreak, has been acknowledged by WHO 9 and echoed by the Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 10, 11 The existing literature on pandemic influenza (PI) modeling aims to address various complex aspects of the pandemic evolution process including: (i) underlying spatio-temporal structure, (ii) contact dynamics and disease transmission, (iii) disease progression, and (iv) development of mitigation strategies. A comprehensive decision-aid model for containment and mitigation has to invariably consider all of the above aspects: it must incorporate the mechanism of disease progression, from initial infection, to the asymptomatic phase, manifestation of symptoms, and a final health outcome; [12] [13] [14] it must also consider the population dynamics, including individual susceptibility 15, 16 and transmissibility, 12, [17] [18] [19] as well as the behavioral factors that affect infection generation and disease progression; [20] [21] [22] [23] finally, it must incorporate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures, including vaccination, antiviral therapy, social distancing and travel restrictions, and use of low-cost measures, such as face masks and hand washing. [24] [25] [26] [27] In recent years, the models for PI containment and mitigation have focused on integrating therapeutical and nontherapeutical measures in search for synergistic strategies, aimed at better resource utilization. Most of these approaches implement a form of social distancing to reduce infection exposure, followed by application of pharmaceutical means. A number of significant contributions has been made in this challenging area. 1, 25, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] One of the most notable among the recent efforts is a 2006-07 initiative by the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) 33 which examined independent models of large-scale PI spread for rural areas of Asia, 34,35 U.S. and U.K., 36, 37 and the city of Chicago. 38 MIDAS cross-validated the models by simulating the city of Chicago, with 8.6 M inhabitants, and implementing targeted layered containment. 39, 40 The research findings of MIDAS and other institutions 14, 25 were used in a recent ""Modeling Community Containment for Pandemic Influenza"" report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), to formulate a set of recommendations for mitigating PI at a local level. 41 These recommendations were used in a pandemic preparedness guidance developed jointly by CDC, HHS, and other federal agencies. 42 At the same time, the IOM report points out several limitations of the MIDAS models, observing that ""because of the significant constraints placed on the models"" being considered by policy makers, ""the scope of the models should be expanded."" The IOM recommends ""to adapt or develop decision-aid models that can ... provide real-time feedback during an epidemic."" The report also emphasizes that ""future modeling efforts should incorporate broader outcome measures ... to include the costs and benefits of intervention strategies"". 41 It can indeed be observed that practically all existing approaches focus on assessment of apriori defined strategies; virtually none of the synergistic decision models are capable of ""learning"", ie, adapting to changes in the pandemic course, yet predicting them, to generate a dynamic optimal strategy. Such a strategy is advantageous in its ability to be state-dependent, ie, as being formed dynamically as the pandemic spreads, by selecting the optimal combination of available mitigation options at each decision epoch, based on the present pandemic state.",28.71438196995616,11.813518557891905

Such checks are not fool proof, but over time they may pick up in some cases a grievance, which can be dealt with prior to the individual further developing towards an act of violence or some other kind of threat such as theft. The next phase ability represents the threat actor's effort to develop a definite pathway to action. It has two sub-categories (plan and preparation ).

Serum samples were also obtained from the 202 individuals who had been to the Washington D.C. postal facility during the precious 2 weeks. All were negative for specific anti-PA IgG, including three individuals who reported a remote history of anthrax vaccination. The consistent negative findings may be explained by the fact that antibiotic therapy was initiated before serum testing and that there were no baseline serum samples available for testing. In addition, the time period from exposure to sampling was very short. Among 28 individuals in the Capitol region with culture-positive nasal swabs who received prophylactic antibiotics immediately, none had a positive culture from a nasal swab repeated 7 days later, and none developed IgG to PA antigen 42 days after exposure. This again emphasizes the limitation and interpretation of a test in someone who had early antibiotic treatment. It does raise forensic utility considerations. Even with these easily disseminated spores, an antibody response may be aborted or modified with antibiotics by early eradication. Furthermore, antibiotics taken before exposure would likely be effective in preventing laboratory and clinical signs of an infection.

Early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quarantine and isolation strategies of patients with COVID-19 can significantly prevent and control the transmission of the virus. By appropriately identifying the infected individuals and minimizing the transmission of the virus in the community, it is possible to effectively control the spread of infection. The early clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lack specificity, and its etiology is difficult to identify through computed tomography scans. Therefore, the handbook guide [1] suggests that the gold standard of diagnosing COVID-19 is real-time fluorescence-based real-time isolation rooms and install air purification systems. Therefore, our hospital designed and set up a special room under negative pressure for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with an air change rate of 12 times per hour.

Tests to detect viral RNA by RT-PCR were rapidly developed following the initial SARS outbreak. The sensitivity of molecular detection is affected by the sample collection site and time since infection. In general, blood is most often the first body fluid in which viral RNA is detected. Over 70% of patients will be positive 3 days after symptom onset with peak values at days 5-6. 13 In comparison, viral RNA is detected in only 30-40% of respiratory tract samples during the first four days and peaks at day 10. If nasopharyngeal swabs are used diagnostically, serial testing should be considered, as a minority of infected patients are positive at the time of presentation. 14 Viral RNA has also been detected in up to 90% of stool samples 15-17 days post-symptom onset in serologically-confirmed SARS patients. 14 For these reasons, a multimodal approach sampling different body fluids at various time points early in infection may be helpful for disease identification when there is a high pre-test probability. The clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR tests may be affected by the region of the virus targeted: The initial SARS PCR assays were directed towards the polymerase gene, while subsequent in vitro data demonstrated a 100fold increase in sensitivity by targeting the nucleocapsid gene. 15 Serologic tests using ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence have been used to monitor convalescent patients and perform serosurveys. The majority of infected patients will seroconvert: IgM values peak between weeks 2-3 after onset of symptoms while remaining detectable up to 12 weeks post-infection; IgG values reach peak titers more slowly and may persist indefinetly. 16, 17 Serological studies have used a range of reagents and methods from indirect immunofluorescence to ELISAs with purified virus or recombinant nucleocapsid protein. 18 ",28.319527290549058,14.521963717341585

For PRRSV, the sensitive bioassay confirmed two positive results of the ReTi-PCR, whereas virus isolations of these semen samples were negative. The presence of neutralizing antibodies may partly interfere with the low virus recovery by virus isolation. The presence of neutralizing antibodies might also explain the low recovery of CSFV in semen collected after day 12 pi by virus isolation, as antibodies were detected in all boars experimentally infected with CSFV. Furthermore, our study also shows that the presence of viruses in semen was detected earlier by ReTi-PCR than by virus isolation, but also earlier than most antibody detection assays.

Early diagnosis and rapid measures to reduce the transmission and spread of list-A diseases, such as CFS, FMD and SVD, are of great importance.

Elbers et al. (2007) have noted that some farmers still ignore the early detection system put in place during the H7N7 epidemic in The Netherlands. Moreover, rising mortality can be caused by other avian diseases and stress conditions leading to a hesitation to notify. Notwithstanding this, the results we describe here have relevance in informing the implementation of an early detection system. It gives policy makers a quantitative and scientific base on which to make decisions on surveillance and control. It feeds into mathematical models of between-flock transmission that are used to inform contingency planning, and contact tracing in an epidemic can be refined based on our estimates of time to detection. Elbers et al. (2007) have highlighted the necessity for good quantification of mortality with respect to flock size as a means for rapid diagnosis of AI. We wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment, and would add that more and better quantification and reporting of all aspects of poultry rearing and key epidemiological parameters such as latent and infectious periods and transmission rates are paramount for developing evidence-based surveillance, control and prevention strategies. Figure 6 highlights and reiterates that imperfect prophylactic vaccination that reduces R 0 to just above 1 can have serious consequences for disease control (Savill et al. 2006) . Time to detection can be significantly increased compared with non-vaccinated birds with much higher R 0 . This suggests that disease could spread through flocks undetected for many weeks before mortality rises above the threshold.

Methods that rely upon fluorescent molecular probes such as molecular beacons (a singlestranded DNA probe with hairpin-like structure; one end of the strand is attached to a fluorescent dye and the other end to a fluorescent quencher), suffer from severe photo-bleaching of the fluorescent dye that limits long-term analysis. Moreover, these probes are not highly sensitive for early detection. Similar limitations are observed using fluorescent protein based probes.

These technologies deliver moreprecise information on infectious agents while reducing reliance on time-consuming and costly diagnostic methods. Enhanced bioinformatics capacity is revolutionizing the ability to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. In 2014, CDC launched the Advanced Molecular Detection Infectious Disease Initiative 9 to improve the ability to detect outbreaks sooner and respond more effectively, saving lives and reducing cost. Recent studies show the growing utility of whole genome sequencing in investigations of hospital infectious disease outbreaks, 5,10 and foodborne outbreaks. 11 Methods of pathogen genomics are also used in the study of genetic variants in infectious diseases, the prediction of antibiotic resistance, and assessing vaccine safety and effectiveness. However, growth in their applications and more work to assess the reliability of new methods, including specificity, sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive values, are anticipated. Beyond genomics, simple approaches such as call data records from mobile phones could eliminate the need for retrospective reporting by infected individuals of their previous locations and contacts. Ultimately, new tools will need to provide added value to explaining the complexity of infectious disease at the population level, given the multitude of factors involved (e.g., environmental, individual's vulnerability, migration patterns, immunologic diversity, and epigenetic mechanisms).",29.73765321015364,13.19503728949692

For influenza virus surveillance in animals, the simple, altruistic reason is that surveillance must be done to protect public health and prevent pandemics (Patriarca and Cox 1997) . Philanthropic intentions aside, it is important to find rationale for surveillance that will also benefit or provide information to all stakeholders. A recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) review for the National Academies, ''Sustaining Global Surveillance and Response to Emerging Zoonotic Diseases,'' hits the nail on the head with its recommendations to improve early detection and response to zoonotic diseases, such as influenza. Specifically, they are of the opinion that comprehensive surveillance would be best achieved in the following manner: ''Multidisciplinary teams of professionals that have relevant expertise and field experience would identify populations at risk and causes and risk factors for infection, and then rapidly and widely disseminate this information so that immediate and longer term disease prevention and control interventions can be implemented (IOM/NRC 2009).'' For influenza virus surveillance in swine in the United States, the rationale for a surveillance system includes not only protection of public health, but detection, discovery, and sharing of virus isolates to facilitate updates for vaccines, refine diagnostic assays, and determine the distribution of new influenza strains in swine to inform further policy decisions (USDA/APHIS 2009). In Europe, the Research Programme of the European Commission funded the coordination of the European Surveillance Network for Influenza in Pigs (ESNIP), a group that set out on a coordinated surveillance mission many years earlier, in 2001, with the stated goal of being to first standardize diagnostic techniques used for surveillance and detection of influenza viruses in pigs. Once the initial goals were achieved, the wealth of information from the surveillance efforts was leveraged for a second round of studies (ESNIP 2007) on the epidemiology and evolution of influenza viruses in European pigs and to optimize influenza diagnostic assays for swine (Kyriakis et al. 2010a ). Naturally, a listed rationale for ESNIP 2 is, ''to obtain insights into the public health risk of influenza in swine by monitoring swine for avian influenza viruses and by comparison of influenza viruses in swine and in human populations.'' ESNIP 3 has since been launched to ''…increase the knowledge of the epidemiology and evolution of swine influenza virus in European pigs'' with significant research investment directed toward detailed antigenic and genetic characterization of influenza virus strains isolated from pigs (European Commission 2010).",28.14549630459985,12.225528754312737

In this regard, we were somewhat disappointed with the fact that patients CWRU-1 and -2, whose antisera reacted most strongly against the protein, did not exhibit potent neutralizing activity as we had hoped. One possible explanation is that there might be epitopes in the MPER that elicit non-neutralizing antibodies. It is conceivable that these antibodies could prevent binding of Nabs that target epitopes in close proximity due to steric hindrance (e.g. 2F5 or 4E10). In this case, observed neutralizing activity would be determined by relative antibody titers and affinity between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies that compete for the adjacent epitopes.

Since the spread of an infectious disease is related to the intensity of contacts between individuals, fragmentation destabilizes the way the parasites circulate in their host population. Recently, Zinkernagel has proposed that a reduction in the frequency of infections by a parasite could lead to the emergence of severe forms of the disease, previously avoided because the disease was contracted early in life and attenuated by maternal antibodies. However, it is still unclear whether this change in disease expression increases the global mortality it induces because the disease becomes more severe and also less frequent. Here, we use a mathematical model to link population fragmentation with the hypothesis of Zinkernagel. Firstly, we show that there is a change in the severity of the disease during the fragmentation process, especially at a local scale, suggesting that host population fragmentation could be a widespread mechanism of disease emergence. Secondly, we show that the emergence of the severe form of the disease can lead to a significant increase in its induced mortality. Finally, we determine the types of interactions for which the fragmentation of the host population could be the most dangerous.",28.05869507600334,12.983319258027407

In this regard, we were somewhat disappointed with the fact that patients CWRU-1 and -2, whose antisera reacted most strongly against the protein, did not exhibit potent neutralizing activity as we had hoped. One possible explanation is that there might be epitopes in the MPER that elicit non-neutralizing antibodies. It is conceivable that these antibodies could prevent binding of Nabs that target epitopes in close proximity due to steric hindrance (e.g. 2F5 or 4E10). In this case, observed neutralizing activity would be determined by relative antibody titers and affinity between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies that compete for the adjacent epitopes.

Surveillance data must be timely and complete to accurately reflect the occurrence and distribution of disease. The types of surveillance currently used are: • Passive disease surveillance refers to the receipt of reports of infections and diseases from physicians, laboratories, and other health professionals required to submit the reports required by public health statute. • Active disease surveillance is guided by public health statute in each state and refers to the routine gathering of data in an effort to identify cases. This type of surveillance can be seasonal or initiated by a mass casualty event that has resulted in an increased number of individuals or potential cohorts presenting with similar symptoms or illnesses. • Syndromic surveillance has been used for early detection of outbreaks; to follow the size, spread, and tempo of outbreaks; to monitor disease trends; and to provide reassurance that an outbreak has not occurred. Syndromic surveillance systems seek to use existing health data in real time to provide immediate analysis and feedback to those charged with the investigation and follow-up of potential outbreaks. The fundamental objective of syndromic surveillance is to identify illness clusters early, before diagnoses are confirmed and reported to public health agencies, and to mobilize a rapid response, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Passive surveillance systems rely on laboratory and hospital staff, physicians, and other relevant sources to take the initiative to provide data on illnesses to the health department, where officials analyze and interpret the information as it arrives. In contrast, in an active disease surveillance system, public health officials contact sources, such as laboratories, hospitals, and physicians, to obtain information on conditions or diseases to identify cases. In theory, active surveillance can provide more complete detection of disease patterns than a system that is wholly dependent on voluntary reporting. Having dedicated personnel to accomplish active surveillance is a challenge for any administrator. Public health departments are traditionally thin on staffing. Taking staff time to look for a problem that may or may not exist, at the expense of one of the many ongoing daily health department programs, is problematic.",30.80283932948032,15.11962812515469

JACOBY AND DIANE J. GAERTNER accepted approach to assess contemporary conditions in a colony is serologic monitoring of strategically placed and exposed sentinels. Sentinels must be immunocompetent, virus-antibody free, and protected from exposure to infectious agents during shipment. The number of sentinels used should reflect assessment of risks to a colony, as illustrated in Chapter 16. Cages of sentinels should be placed, by rack and room, to facilitate controlled exposure to potential sources of infection. One popular configuration for rats housed in conventional wire-top caging is to place sentinels on the lowest shelf of a rack to maximize natural exposure to bedding expelled from overlying cages. Additionally, samples of soiled bedding collected during routine cage changing (e.g., weekly) can be placed in sentinel cages to increase the sensitivity of detection. This strategy also helps to compensate for the use of isolation and individually ventilated caging, which limits airborne transmission of viral agents and by doing so, also may inhibit early detection of infection. However, limited durability of excreted virus in soiled bedding and the potential that small amounts of virus could be diluted to nonimmunogenic levels in pooled bedding samples also must be considered. Targeted selection of soiled bedding samples also can be helpful to trace infection to a sector of a suspect rack or shelf. For this procedure to work satisfactorily, cage positions should not be changed during the testing interval. Sampling intervals for sentinel rats generally range from 30 to 90 days, but, minimally, must be long enough to complete desired exposure and allow opportunity for seroconversion, which typically occurs by 2 weeks after an immunogenic exposure. Sentinel animals can be sampled repeatedly if they remain seronegative, but should be replaced if they develop antibodies. As a general rule, sentinels, regardless of serologic status, should be replaced every 6 to 12 months to permit incremental assessment, such as histopathology.",30.9060772648795,13.739354437288664

Strengths of the study include the prospective collection of specimens during periods of illness and health, comprehensive viral diagnostic testing, and high rates of retention. In addition, the URECA cohort focuses on urban children of low socioeconomic status who have high rates of respiratory morbidity in early life and of asthma in childhood. Comparison to the COAST cohort is facilitated by the use of similar illness ascertainment and sampling methods and by use of the same viral diagnostic system [12] . The COAST and URECA studies both enrolled children with a family history of allergies or asthma, and there could be differences between patterns of respiratory illness in these children and patterns in the general population. The demographic characteristics of the cohorts are quite different, and since there are major differences in socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and lifestyle (Table 1) , one limitation of the study is that multivariate analysis to determine which of these specific factors contribute to the different patterns of respiratory illnesses and pathogens is not possible. An additional limitation is that the samples from the 2 cohorts were collected 7 years apart. Since the samples collected in Madison yielded differences with all 4 of the urban centers and because continued monitoring in the COAST cohort has revealed persistently low rates of adenovirus isolation ( [3] and unpublished data), the temporal difference is unlikely to account for the observed differences.",31.28507145224909,14.605786971177805

Historical efforts to track and contain outbreaks have relied on classical methods to study disease incidence at the population level. Outbreak containment was achieved primarily through isolating infected patients and contact tracing to establish appropriate quarantine procedures. While often effective, these methods are time consuming and imprecise, particularly when diagnosis is based exclusively on clinical data. Until the advent and implementation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods in the early 2000s, laboratory diagnostics were heavily reliant on serology. Unfortunately, serological assays are typically not useful during an acute virus infection, as they cannot detect exposure to a particular pathogen until the patient has mounted a detectable neutralizing antibody response. Even then, they cannot distinguish between different viral strains within a given serotype and are not useful for monitoring virus evolution. While PCR and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) have enabled direct early detection of virus genomes, these amplificationbased methods are unfortunately heavily biased and dependent on the sequence of oligonucleotide primers. PCR-based methodologies are not useful for screening or surveillance of unknown pathogens or those that diverge highly from known prototypic strains, nor can they monitor virus evolution in real time during an outbreak. Thus, methods that can provide detailed information about an emerging virus at the sequence level are proving essential to realizing the promise of genomics as an epidemiologic tool (Barzon et al., 2011; Quiñ ones-Mateu et al., 2014; Sloots et al., 2015) . Combining experimental, clinical, and computational approaches with pathogen genomics will give us a systems-level understanding of how viruses cause illness ( Figure 1 ). Moving forward, we will also be able to more confidently identify the etiologic agents associated with pathogenic virus infections utilizing host transcriptional signatures. Thus, rather than having to fulfill Koch's postulates to be certain of the cause of disease, scientists and clinicians will be able to use genomic information about the virus combined with the host response transcriptional signature to make more confident associations and diagnoses. In this review, we examine the existing and emerging genomic technologies that are being employed for the analysis of viruses and the infections they cause. Throughout, we include examples of the effective use of these technologies for epidemiological, virological, and medical applications. Finally, we provide some thoughts looking forward toward emerging viruses, such as Zika.",32.00663837826096,13.929505218690087

Among chemical methods used, formaldehyde and organic compounds such as cyclic esters (β-propiolactone) or binary ethylenimine (BEI) have been most widely used. Other cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde can be an option for the inactivation but its use has not been as wide as formaldehyde. Two main caveats of the use of cross-linking agents for vaccine preparation can be cited; the fi rst one is the potential for aggregation leading to disruption or modifi cation of antigenic epitopes possibly accounting for the reduced immunogenicity of these vaccines, usually requiring two or three booster doses to maintain adequate and lasting levels of protective immunity. Another problem is the risk for incomplete inactivation leading to exacerbation of disease if the partially (or suboptimal) induced immunity cooperates with infectivity by mechanisms such as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). In this case, monocytes or macrophages (Fc-receptors bearing cells) can be infected by virus complexed to non-neutralizing antibodies, a process described in dengue virus infections [ 12 ] . Finally, another issue with inactivated vaccines is overcoming the differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals not to interfere with the surveillance diagnostics. While formaldehyde reacts primarily with proteins, β-propiolactone (BPL) and binary ethylenimine (BEI) modify mainly DNA or RNA so BPL is expected to maintain a high immunogenicity during the inactivation of viruses. However it has been reported that BPL may also and react to some amino acids including cysteine, methionine, and histidine so certain modifi cation of proteins may also affect the immunogenicity of BPL vaccines. Similarly BEI has been also shown to react with proteins [ 13 ] . This compound is used widely for the inactivation of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the preparation of vaccines. Nonetheless, inactivated vaccines remain as a leading methodology for vaccine production (both for human and veterinary use) in part due to the effectiveness of adjuvants (mainly aluminum salts) in the vaccine formulations overcoming the main issue of limited immunity. In fact, this technology may benefi t from other inactivation approaches such as the use of hydrogen peroxide or protonating compounds, such as diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC). Hydrogen peroxide could inactivate both DNA and RNA viruses (vaccinia virus, LCMV, WNV and YFV) with little damage to the antigenic structure, thus minimizing the effect on immunogenicity. More interestingly, this inactivation approach rendered vaccines able to induce both humoral (neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immune responses including WNV and LCMV specifi c CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells [ 14 , 15 ] . Using a histidine-protonating agent such as DEPC it was reported the abolishment of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infectivity and pathogenicity in mice. These animals survived a further lethal challenge and this protection was associated to the induction of neutralizing antibodies [ 16 ] although no further reports have arose since the fi rst description. In spite of the advances made in different technologies for stimulating the immune responses the classic inactivation methodology is still broadly used to manufacture many vaccines for veterinary use, in part since manufacturers need to balance carefully the investment needed to adapt their traditional manufacturing processes to the new technologies and the expected profi tability. Other classical inactivation techniques by physical methods have been exposure to several types of radiation: thermal, electromagnetic or ionizing. UV radiation has been one of the most used in human vaccine manufacturing.",28.664737879912835,13.56869548846113

Their correlation with survival has been difficult to determine due to the variability in antibody responses.

Additionally, neutralizing antibodies against LASV are not produced in large quantities during infection due to the structural properties of the LASV GPC and its glycan shield, potentially limiting the role of the humoral response in protection.21 Despite these issues, the importance of antibodies in protection against LASV may be understated. The vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine expressing LASV glycoprotein (VSV-LASV-GPC) is able to induce a strong humoral response against LASV GPC and provides similar protection to vaccines inducing strong T-cell responses.28 The use of immune plasma and convalescent serum as a treatment for LASV infection in experimental models has shown mixed results, likely contributing to the skepticism of the protective ability of antibodies.34–36 However, the use of human monoclonal antibodies in both guinea pig and NHP models of LF has shown to be protective.37,38 These monoclonal antibodies used for protection in both models have a high neutralizing index, providing evidence that perhaps a strong neutralizing response may be protective.

Cell culture infectivity was a mainstay for a very long time, but it was eventually established that available host cell systems did not support replication of noroviruses and most strains of hepatitis A and E viruses. The advent of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has changed the situation greatly. The RT-PCR is now a first line of diagnostic testing, and is also applied to food and environmental samples (Widdowson and Vinjé 2008). With added sequencing of amplicons, important epidemiologic associations can be established. The concern about RT-PCR detection, as applied to food and environmental samples but not to clinical specimens, is the general inability to determine whether the detected virus was infectious at the time of sampling. All the same, the ability to detect these viruses by RT-PCR (including real-time RT-PCR, or by microarrays) is of great importance in outbreak investigation and may provide information that is useful in devising preventive measures.",28.069268322431963,13.50585152879891

These activities require effective systems to identify salient information gaps (or potentially hazardous rumours and misinformation), craft and adapt messaging and rapidly disseminate it to the population.18 The dissemination of information is only a first step; risk communications must also be accepted and adopted by the public. Several factors influence public acceptance of official communications, including the population’s level of trust in authorities,19 as well as overall level of public education. Educated and literate populations are more likely to be aware of basic public health practices and risks, and to understand and respond to expert guidance for behavioural changes to limit disease risks.20

Cytomegalovirus has a high seroprevalence, and large numbers of transplant patients experience reactivation or primary infection, with probability increasing based on pre-transplant serostatus, severity of pretransplant conditioning, and allograft relatedness.14,15 Although infection can be subclinical, high or increasing viral load signals increased the risk of symptomatic disease, which can range from relatively mild constitutional symptoms to severe end-organ infection or potentially fatal disseminated disease. Preemptive therapy of high-risk patients based on the detection of increasing CMV load in peripheral blood was shown to be effective in the 1990s16,17; however, the first FDA-approved IVD test did not appear on the market until 2012.18 In the intervening years, laboratory-developed assays played a critical role in bridging the gap. The presence of such methods and their adoption across the country enabled the routine use of CMV screening for asymptomatic patients in transplant centers soon after data supported its utility. The availability of such methods has likely saved many lives over the years, supporting early diagnosis, preemptive treatment strategies, and the assessment of therapeutic treatment efficacy.14,18-20 The widespread use of LDP CMV quantitative methods produced a generation of transplant physicians comfortable with the use of such methods and changed the epidemiology of posttransplant CMV disease, markedly reducing the incidence of early disease in such patients. Over the years of LDP use, numerous studies focused on continuous improvement and optimization of methods,21 including the development of international quantitative standards in 2010.22 The ability to rapidly incorporate advances in technology (including the advent of real-time quantitative methods) has been demonstrated by the improvement in sensitivity and other performance characteristics of such tests over time. The data accumulated throughout these experiences informed the development of the first commercially available CMV IVD assays.

For example, wastewater treatment plants and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) can be valuable sampling points, since sampling and characterizing community wastewater and livestock manure represents a snapshot of the status of community human and animal health.The Michigan Water Environment Association maintains a list of wastewater facilities in the state of Michigan [41]. Sampling can also take place at other locations, such as storm drains, agricultural field runoff drains, and areas that have recently experienced combined sewer overflows. Other agricultural data could also be valuable in determining sampling points in rural areas of the watershed, such as amount of fertilizer purchased per week per county and location of CAFOs. The Sierra Club maintains a readily available map of CAFOs throughout the United States, including in Michigan [42]. CAFO locations can help to determine where livestock populations are most abundant, heightening the risk for both animal disease and zoonotic disease. Beyond agricultural data, information on surface water quality can also be of use. For example, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) reports figures for public beach closures, which occur when surface water contamination is detected during regular screening for pathogen indicators.

One possibility is that our sampling from this patient was done before peak serological responses. Another possibility is that the high frequency of these potent antibodies in the memory B cell compartment may have resulted in rapid resolution of infection, precluding the development of a high serological response.

Attempts to test potential anti-SARS agents using antiviral antibodies, entry inhibitors, proteinase inhibitors, calpain inhibitors, ribavirin (nucleoside analogues), interferons, and short interfering RNAs were riddled with contradictory reports from different laboratories. The lack of clinical trials also prevented the reaching of a conclusive agreement for effective anti-SARS strategies (reviewed by Weiss et al.61). Nevertheless, human convalescent-phase plasma seemed to shorten hospitalization without adverse effects if it is administered as an immunotherapy to SARS patients early in the course of infection.62 With the finding that recovered SARS patients have higher and more sustainable levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to those who had succumbed to the disease,63 monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization were also obtained using phage-display antibody libraries and immortalization of B cells from convalescent SARS patients.64,65",27.897005012291096,12.891248118609287

It was proposed on structural grounds that these base-binding antibodies potently neutralize by blocking fusogenic rearrangement and membrane insertion by GP2. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that neutralizing antibodies targeting the EBOV GP base inhibit viral fusion triggering (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, higher concentrations of neutralizing antibody were required to inhibit lipid mixing to the same extent as infection, but this may typify fusion by enveloped viruses. A recent study by Otterstrom et al. (57) examined the levels of antibody binding needed to inhibit influenza virus hemifusion. Using a pair of potent, broadly effective neutralizing antibodies, whose inhibitory profiles against influenza virus strains are very similar to those of KZ52 and ZMapp against filoviruses (58, 59), the authors showed that only high concentrations of these stem-binding antibodies were able to block the majority of hemifusion events. Although their assay (viral particles bound to a supported bilayer) differed from ours, their data strongly corroborate our results, with approximately 50 to 150 µg/ml of either anti-influenza virus antibody needed to reduce in vitro hemifusion by ~90%.

Thereafter, the neutralizing antibody titers in sera of vaccinated sows gradually increased, likely resulting from a homologous boost. All the three sows maintained high neutralizing antibody titers for 2 weeks post-farrowing. Consistent to the results from the serum samples, the neutralizing antibody level was significantly high in the colostrum of vaccinated sows (Fig. 9B). Furthermore, the nursing piglets from each litter in group 1 had pre-challenge neutralizing antibody levels similar to those of their own dam and retained antibodies up to 7 DPI, indicating the protective effect of lactogenic immunity passively acquired from vaccinated sows (Fig. 9C).

Anticipated decision regret is an attitude of people which leads them to take actions that are directed at preventing possible future incidents. If I take this preventive measure now, it will mean that I do not have to blame myself (or get blamed by others) for not having done everything to prevent that incident from happening. This attitude also can be observed in health care. A growing number of preventive screening tests are offered that provide information of the chance of developing some kind of disease. It is often not taken in consideration that the chance of really getting this disease is very small. And it is possible that the measures that are taken to prevent the disease negatively influence lifestyles. The Dutch medical sociologist Tjeerd Tijmstra (2001) gives some—often hilarious—examples of anticipated decision regret: if a mother gets a screening test for her child offered for a disease for which the risk is 1 in 90,000, there is a great willingness to participate. And even if it is explained to people that the chance of having a car accident while driving to the clinic is about as much as that particular risk, still many people decide to go on. Their motivation seems to be: suppose our baby does develop that disease, then we should not forgive ourselves not to have done everything to prevent it. There are signals that this anticipated decision regret has become an attitude in security issues also. But in the field of security governments and other public agencies (such as scientific organizations) are bearers of the attitude more than individual citizens. After 9/11—let it be repeated again—security measures against possible terrorist attacks have been given an enormous priority. It looks as if governments are willing to invest a lot of energy in minimizing the chances of terrorist attacks. They do not want to take the risk that they have not done everything to prevent an assault. This attitude can be based on experience. Officials of the Dutch government were reproached for not having done enough to prevent the murder of film director Theo van Gogh (2004). These reproaches have led to decisions that are directed at minimizing the chance of new attacks. With—in general—societal and political support a good deal of money and a lot of energy are devoted to this topic. It is not farfetched to suppose that this is one of the effects of our common anticipated decision regret.",23.590466752550363,12.27962657731322

A small sample study in MERS-CoV infection showed that the neutralizing antibody titer should exceed 1:80 to achieve effective CP therapy (12) . To find eligible donors who have high levels of neutralizing antibody is a prerequisite. Cao (23) et al showed that the level of specific neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV decreased gradually 4 months after the disease process, reaching undetectable levels in 25.6% (IgG) and 16.1% (neutralizing antibodies) of patients at 36 months after disease status. A study from the MERS-CoV infected patients and the exposed healthcare workers showed that the prevalence of MERS-CoVIgGseroreactivity was very low (2.7%), and the antibodies titer decreased rapidly within 3 months (24) . These studies suggested that the neutralizing antibodies represented short-lasting humoral immune response and plasma from recently recovered patients should be more effective. In the present study, recently recovered COVID-19 patients, who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 with neutralizing antibody titer above 1:640and recruited from local hospitals should be considered as suitable donors. The median age of donors was lower than that of recipients (42.0 vs. 52.5 years). Among the nine cases investigated, the neutralizing antibody titers of five patients increased while four patients kept the same level to 1:640 within two days.

BACKGROUND Initial phase of the Covid-19 outbreak in Germany is well captured by a standard SIR model An epidemic outbreak in the absence of mitigation measures can be described by an SIR model with a constant spreading rate λ. Effects of mitigation measures can be approximated as change points in λ, which only manifest after starting mitigation measures and an observation delay.

During this initial phase, three tasks are of particular importance to provide time-critical information for crisis mitigation: (1) establishing central epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number that can be used for short-term forecasting; (2) simulating the effects of different possible intervention measures aimed at mitigation of the outbreak; (3) estimating the actual effects of the measures taken to rapidly adjust them and to adapt short-term forecasts. Tackling these tasks is challenging due to the large statistical and systematic errors present during the initial stages of an epidemic with its low case numbers. Further complications arise from mitigation measures being taken rapidly, while the outbreak unfolds, but taking effect only after an unknown delay. To obtain sensible parameter estimates for short-term forecasting and policy evaluation despite these complications, any prior knowledge available needs to be integrated into modeling efforts to reduce uncertainties. This includes knowledge about basic mechanisms of disease transmission, recovery, as well as preliminary estimates of epidemiological parameters from other countries, or from closely related pathogens. The integration of prior knowledge, the quantitative assessment of the remaining uncertainties about epidemiological parameters, and the principled propagation of these uncertainties into forecasts is the domain of Bayesian modeling and inference.",28.095863315505063,12.92822581784407

Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have 26 been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to 27 identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that 28 inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this 29 study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and 30 interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The 31 sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein 32 compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to 33 interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that 34 SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies 35 used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the β-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein 36 and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the 37 binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by 38 antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may 39 have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that 40 F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity.

For example, the number of total infections may be interpreted differently depending upon the virulence of the disease. The tolerance for new infections may be low if the consequences are high, such as if the infection is almost always fatal or is associated with severe symptoms and long-term complications. Additionally, the availability of diagnostic tests may further refine the use of early warning capabilities; a more sensitive early detection capability could be combined with a cued use of diagnostic testing to form a much more targeted approach, reducing costs and the likelihood of a false detection.

We integrated the early warning performance metrics from our PRESAGED algorithm-populationwide probability of early detection, daily false-alarm rate, and early detection time-into a base SEIR model. As shown in Figure 7 , a host-based early warning system would trigger exposed individuals to transition into quarantine at a rate characterized by the product of the parameters λ and PD. The parameter λ is an early detection rate defined as the inverse of the system's average early detection time for a given pathogen. The parameter PD is the population-wide probability of early detection, i.e., the fraction of the exposed population that will present early detections of pathogen exposure prior to becoming infectious. Missed detection cases, when the system fails to produce an early warning, occur with a probability of 1 -PD across the exposed population. For this policy, false alarms of the host-based early warning system would cause healthy individuals to be incorrectly quarantined. Our model takes this notion into account by adding a transition rate from the susceptible to the quarantined compartment, characterized by a daily false-alarm rate κ, the probability of an individual's early warning system presenting a false alarm on a given day. .

The reduction of cumulative infections for all notional early warning systems, relative to the self-monitoring policy, was less prominent than in scenarios of low initial exposure as the initial exposed population was close to saturation.

On the other side, implementing very strict confinement measures from an early stage would give governments a much needed time to prepare against the attack of the disease, but would most likely take a huge toll in the economy, and consequently, in the population.",26.91110330721828,12.818692859663392

Important for the current debate about the natural history of the disease, this policy would also work if there is a fraction of asymptomatic but infectious individuals in the population. Our results also show that from a practical point of view, a combination of all the analyzed contexts can have second order benefits. As already stressed, containment measures should not only be directed towards a full cutdown of the number of infected cases. Their efficacy is also given by other factors, such as delaying, even if only by a few days, the spreading of the disease. Such delays are always good for preparedness and to have more time for clinical research that can lead to new pharmacological treatments or vaccines. For instance, even if traffic restrictions are not effective on their own, they facilitate the control of the population and thus it would be easier to detect infected individuals and treat them. Similarly, self-protection measures and other social-distancing practices delay the spreading of the disease, freeing resources that would allow for a better management of the epidemic, in turn leading to an increase of the efficacy of individual isolation. Closing public places would, in practice, reduce the transmission, which again will lower the total number of infections and thus make them more manageable for the public health system. This also highlights the importance of having a coordinated response system, since simply adopting central measures like imposing mobility restrictions and closing public places is not effective in the middle-to-long term.",19.661953844858267,11.182328505696425

It was based on confirmed cases, and by excluding suspected cases or mild cases may have under-estimated the rate of spread of the disease. We did not estimate the values of the parameters defining the transition rate from exposed to infectious, or infected to recovered, but fixed them at previously published values. This was a necessary decision because the clinical features of the disease are not yet fully understood, and may affect estimates. However, our intuition after fitting these models is that the maximum likelihood estimate of the force of infection naturally adjusts to fit the value of the recovery rate, and produces a broadly similar value of the basic reproduction number as a result. Furthermore, to adjust for the still-arbitrary nature of these estimates of key parameters, we used some methods that do not depend on any assumptions about these aspects of the disease process. Another limitation of this study is the uncertainty introduced by the use of multiple modeling methods, which we combined with a weighted average. However, we believe that by presenting varying methods with different assumptions along with a weighted average, we enable researchers and policy-makers to make judgements about the dangers of the epidemic without relying on any particular set of assumptions about a disease that is not yet well understood.",22.58813963390064,11.003770201601933
