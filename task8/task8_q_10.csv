In July 2016, DGHP, with support from the East African Public Health Laboratory Network (EAPHL), the World Bank, the American Society for Microbiology and FIND, assisted in preparing the MoH-NPHLS Microbiology reference laboratory for ISO15189 accreditation. There were 8 key elements needed for accreditation: 1) developing Standard Operating Procedures for all microbiology tests used for clinical diagnosis, 2) laboratory training for all microbiology assays 3) training for microbiology equipment (e.g., BACTEC), 4) equipment preventive maintenance, 5) participation in External Quality Assessment panel for microbiology 6) internal quality control 7) quality improvement protocols and 8) process improvement and control protocols. To ensure a successful ISO 15189 accreditation, DGHP worked together with MoH on all non-conformities identified by WHO auditors. Similarly DGHP assisted and prepared KEMRI laboratories operating as DLSP to successfully obtain ISO 15189 accreditation for its Nairobi and Kisumu laboratories in 2014. WHO accreditation of NPHLS for microbiology provided a framework for the implementation of AMR surveillance and strengthening of county laboratory capacity initiated through a pilot study in two county referral hospitals (Thika and Kitale counties) where DLSP trained county staff in stockpile management, sample collection, sample packaging, shipment and specimen chain-of-custody to support microbiology laboratories in these regions. Establishing an effective system for AMR characterization and surveillance requires a properly functioning microbiology laboratory with inventory management, quality media production, biochemical testing, serotyping, drug susceptibility testing capacity, specimen referral system, and shipping. In preparation for AMR testing, DGHP with support of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and DGHT, assisted in developing the KEMRI Production Unit for the manufacturing of prepared microbiology reagents (e.g., MacConkey agar, chocolate agar and sheep blood agar plates) to facilitate microbiology testing at both NPHLS and tier 2-6 hospital laboratories throughout Kenya. DLSP, in collaboration with NPHLS, provided training for microbiology in the AMR pilot sites at Thika and Kitale as well as mentorship in order to systematically implement this capacity throughout Kenya.

If an individual complied with household quarantine, their infectiousness to other household members changed by a factor of e Q . Because quarantine increases the average time spent at home substantially for most people, the value of this parameter may be greater than unity (e Q ¼ 2 at baseline; see Table 1) . Also, the level of transmission in isolation may be higher than elsewhere. We assumed that the degree of transmission in isolation was a factor of e I greater (e I ¼ 1 at baseline; see Table 1 ), i.e., the basic reproductive number inside transmission was equal to e I R 0 (see Protocol S1). Note that we assumed that for all policies, those individuals with symptoms severe enough to be hospitalized (see Figure 1 ) would be isolated. Hence, policies without explicit isolation elements used isolation resources. Also, we assumed that all those in isolation received anti-viral treatment. Hence, policies without explicit anti-viral elements used anti-viral doses. We modeled compliance at the individual level: a symptomatic individual in a household that was not quarantined decided for herself if she reported, but the other members of her household made independent decisions for themselves. We defined p c to be the probability of compliance.",10.125910099543313,7.612730069626384

Developing appropriate policies and allocating responsibilities for the workforce is needed at both central and subnational levels of government. 29 ,39,61 3 . Legislation and policies should strive to incorporate and balance global, regional, national and subnational priorities for health security. 30 ,31,47 4 . For sustainable financing, detailed long-term national strategic plans with budget allocations should be developed in partnership between government, national stakeholders, and non-state actors (i.e. companies, high net-worth individuals and philanthropic foundations). 47 ,52,71 5 . The national health system and sociocultural context of a country will determine priorities for funding and other resource needs for IHR (2005) core capacity development, emergency response and the health workforce. 64,70 6 . Creating and empowering a national secretariat responsible for mobilizing and securing resources from state and non-state actors can help ensure sustainable and continuous financing. 39, 44, 47 Core capacity 2: Coordination and national focal point communications 1. Existing regional and global intergovernmental organizations can be recruited to collaborate and co-manage international epidemics. 26 33 Nevertheless, minimizing delays in discovering and declaring disease outbreaks remains a global priority. 81 Prospectively, vertical disease surveillance systems (e.g. population-based surveys for HIV/AIDS, case reporting for malaria and cohort monitoring for tuberculosis) could be used and adapted when developing and maintaining the surveillance core capacity of IHR (2005). 30 Although complementary in nature, the preparedness and response core capacities were often implemented independently of one another. For example, areas requiring coordination across both of these core capacities, such as case management or infection control, were not well-documented. Taking a holistic approach to IHR (2005) core capacity development could avoid these issues. 26, 45, 52 Moreover, there were cases in which it was difficult to implement national IHR (2005) policies. For example, in the United Republic of Tanzania protocols for isolating patients with certain diseases were developed, but due to shortages of public-sector health facilities private sector hospitals had to be used during epidemics. 27 This highlights the need to adapt global core capacities requirements to locally appropriate policies and solutions. 3 .

Despite this common backbone, the protocols differ from each other in several details. For example, different methods are used for purification and concentration of virus particles. As the virus particles are very heterogeneous in shape and size [23] , the applied filtration method will strongly influence the result of the analysis. Moreover, the genomes of viruses consist of either DNA or RNA, which additionally may appear in different topologies [23] . Most of the protocols analyse DNA and RNA separately [13, 17, 21, 22] , which makes the comparison between both groups of viruses difficult. In many of the protocols, various amplification steps, which may affect the distribution of the different genome types, are implemented. In addition, either primary sequence reads or contigs assembled from these sequence reads were used for analysis. All of these variations in the applied protocols may lead to different results. Indeed, the reported composition of the human viral gut community varies remarkably, which -beside other factors -may also be caused by application of different protocols for its analysis [17] [18] [19] 21] .",9.878027452992868,8.239387421696001

Although there are some differences in the length of gestation, placental structure, and fetal development between humans and animal models, many structural and functional parallels exist, [94] [95] [96] which serve as tractable platforms for evaluating the safety and efficacy of various therapies during pregnancy. Similar to humans, pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have a hemochorial placenta, and their relatively short gestation and large litters are advantageous for performing high throughput screening of candidate therapeutics for safety and efficacy. Preclinical behavioral testing of rodent offspring has proven to be a promising avenue for identifying and predicting adverse effects associated with prenatal drug exposure in children. 97 Both rodent and rabbit models have been instrumental in testing teratogenic effects of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treating malaria in pregnant women. These studies concluded that drug-related teratogenic effects are limited to the first trimester, which supports the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that artemisinin may be administered only during the second or third trimester in pregnant women. 98, 99 One limitation of mouse and rat models, however, is their inability to recapitulate certain elements of human congenital disease. For instance, because murine CMV is not transmitted vertically as it is in humans, other animal models, including guinea pigs and nonhuman primates, are required for studying this aspect of disease pathogenesis. Studies in pregnant nonhuman primates have been instrumental for the identification of CD4 + T cell responses as critical for early control of CMV infection and transmission during pregnancy, 100 and studies in guinea pigs have demonstrated that a single-cycle infectious CMV vaccine induces immune responses similar to natural infection and protects against congenital infection. 101 Guinea pigs are also a useful model of chlamydial genital infection in humans. Experimental venereal infection with Chlamydophila caviae mimics disease associated with C. trachomatis in humans, including both sexual and perinatal transmission. Guinea pigs have therefore served as a useful model for testing candidate vaccines and treatments. 102 Rabbits continue to serve as an important model of venereal infection with Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, which is associated with congenital disease in humans. While natural infection in rabbits is associated with the species-specific T. paraluiscanuculi, rabbits can be experimentally inoculated with human T. pallidum, and have been instrumental in testing the efficacy of candidate vaccines. 103 Many mammalian species, including rodents, 104 ruminants, 105 and nonhuman primates, 40, 106 are susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and demonstrate similar fetal complications when infection occurs during pregnancy. Studies in various animal models have uniquely contributed to our understanding of placental listeriosis and serve as a platform for evaluating prevention strategies. 107, 108 Finally, mice, 85 cotton rats, 86 guinea pigs, 88 and sheep 87 are all susceptible to infection with RSV, and vaccination of pregnant animals has facilitated the development and testing of maternal immunization strategies for protecting against neonatal RSV. Based on preliminary studies in guinea pigs, 88 an experimental RSV recombinant F nanoparticle vaccine is now being evaluated in third-trimester pregnant women (Clintrials.gov, NCT02247726).",9.913864681476921,7.8747697952132425

A benefit common to the scenarios is that OF sample testing for surveillance could contribute to emergency preparedness and response efforts directed toward ASF, CSF, or FMD in swine. Of the scenarios evaluated, OF sample testing may be most valuable in an outbreak setting, where the use of aggregate screening samples would minimize the disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes, and decrease resource requirements compared to individual animal sampling regimens. Immediate broad implementation is not possible due to several limitations and information gaps. These include: (1) USDA validation of OF sample diagnostics for ASF, CSF, and FMD in swine is still underway, (2) information on test performance in a field setting is lacking, and (3) confirmatory testing of suspected false-positive OF sample findings may demand timeintensive or costly follow-up testing protocols (e.g., repeat on-farm sampling and/or next generation sequencing).",16.372895203642244,9.214971350544957

The presence of these modified risk factors may alert physicians to avoid secondary hospital exposures, such as blood products transfusions, excessive fluid administration, infusion of potentially toxic drugs, high tidal volume mechanical ventilation, and gastric aspiration. Implementation of ventilator associated pneumonia prevention bundles decreases the incidence of VAP and can lower the incidence of ARDS [17] . Implementation of automated ARDS electronic screening in USA hospitals such as ""ASSIST"" (electronic alert from laboratory when the arterial blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia and the radiology department when chest X-ray shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates) to identify intubated patients with ARDS in medical and surgical ICUs showed a sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI, 96.8-98.4%) and specificity of 96.8% (95% CI, 96.8-98.4%) when compared to a manual screening algorithm that had a sensitivity of 57.1% (95% CI, 54.5-59.8%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI, 99.4-100%) in 1270 ICU patients over a 21-week period during enrollment in ARDSNet trials [23] .

Infectious individuals who recover become susceptible once again, and thus immunity due to infection and subsequent recovery are not considered. Clancy [36] studied the properties of optimal policies for isolation and immunization assuming that all infectious individuals can be immediately isolated and all susceptible individuals can be immediately immunized. The policy takes no action when the number of infectious is below an optimal threshold and immediately isolates and/or immunizes when the number exceeds the threshold. However, they can only obtain optimal policies when the state space is small. Morton and Wickwire [40] developed optimal control policies for immunization assuming an infinite pandemic terminal time. However their switching curve derivation has an error in the derivatives (Eqs. 7a and 7b of [40] ) and thus their results are unclear.

Preventive performance in finding true positives (i.e., PPV of quarantine combined with rapid diagnostic testing) appeared not to be very sensitive to the length of quarantine (for t > 2 days). This result suggests that if diagnostic test kit supplies are plentiful, then testing should be done early in quarantine. But if a test kit sparing approach is used (i.e., avoiding testing of those who become symptomatic) then there is not much benefit in delaying testing until after day 2 in quarantine. A test with both high sensitivity and high specificity would also allow for better use of resources if the travellers who tested negative are released into the community. Since PPV is mainly determined by prevalence at the source, it should be noted that an exit screening process at the source lowers the prevalence as well as PPV. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of quarantine itself is independent of the prevalence, and moreover, lower prevalence among incoming individuals yields a higher chance of extinction (or greater ripple effect of quarantine (Figures 4 and 5) ). NPV of quarantine combined with diagnostic testing would be extremely high with quarantine periods for lengths of 3 days or longer, supporting our suggestion to release quarantined individuals testing negative to the rapid diagnostic test into the community (if there was high confidence in test performance parameters for the emergent pandemic strain). In light of our findings, island countries may consider including influenza testing capacity and test kit stockpiles in their pandemic plans. The use of rapid diagnostic tests, if available through stockpiling in advance or rapid delivery after pandemic emergence, may permit more effective border control, with more efficient use of isolation facilities and shortening of the quarantine period.",10.492663876952667,5.110028441110927

Hence, the additional benefit of arrival screening is greatest when efficacy of departure screening is relatively low, for example if potentially infected travellers primarily depart regions with limited public health re-sources and arrive in regions where public health resources are more abundant. Yet even costly policies that combine exit and arrival screening lack the potential to prevent all case importations.

It is first necessary to establish a knowledge database of common microorganisms for lung infections: a database of background microorganisms common to each laboratory and testing unit in SGS testing and record the number of common fragments detected. If a suspected pathogen fragment that is not in the range of common background bacteria appears in the SGS test of clinical specimens, or the number of fragments of a certain microorganism is significantly higher than the data in the background microbial database, it is included in the suspected responsible pathogen, and further methods are used for authenticating. In the alveolar lavage fluid, possible responsible bacteria, fungi, or virus fragments were detected by SGS, and the proportion of the total fragments was often extremely low, even only a few fragments, which is difficult to be diagnosed. SGS testing is often only useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary systemic infections, and when pathogens for nonclinical routine screening are detected, further use of classical pathogen detection methods is needed for diagnosis. is requires the development of a well-developed pathogen verification test system, especially for pathogenic microorganisms that are not easily detected by some common methods. Because the current SGS testing cost is still high, it cannot be widely used in the clinic, and it also affects its timeliness. SGS is also only a pathogen detection method, and it has just been applied in clinical practice. erefore, there are also blind spots and misunderstandings of its monitoring. e excessive expectation and interpretation of SGS detection results can not only push up the cost of clinical testing, but also make it effective. e examination could not be carried out smoothly, which also led to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.",10.551674305175917,6.8888549234184735

The sequencing of a virus with homology to prototype HTLV-I from a seroindeterminate cell line implicates exposure to the virus in at least some HTLV-I/II seroindeterminates. This finding may suggest that exposure to HTLV-I is greater than previously estimated. Of concern are reports that have demonstrated serum samples with negative HTLV-I/II results by EIA, which may also have seroindeterminate banding patterns by WB [12] . Since these sera were initially screened as HTLV-I/II EIA negative (see Figure 1 ), these samples (that also have an HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate WB pattern) would enter the blood supply and be available for transfusion [37] . There have also been instances of serum samples testing EIA positive and WB indeterminate at one point in time, and later testing EIA negative, while remaining seroindeterminate by WB [33] . This implies testing at one time point by EIA cannot ensure the exclusion of seroindeterminate samples. If seroindeterminate blotting patterns are a result of infection or exposure to HTLV-I (a virus associated with neurodegenerative disease, among other illnesses), and blood samples with these patterns can be negative by EIA screening and enter the blood supply, this poses a possible risk to those transfused with HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate blood although the clinical consequence of obtaining blood from an HTLV-I/II WB seroindeterminate donor is not known. Based on these observations there is a need for more stringent screening techniques for blood banks to ensure blood from seroindeterminate donors is not transfused. Increasingly sensitive and specific assays are currently being optimized to better detect anti-HTLV-I antibody responses.",10.262880182993008,4.1740833453025

Sometimes participants were informed about the policies by external sources such as: external networks, Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care updates, Ministry sponsored webinars, and the Ministry's formal launch. A director noted: ""I think mostly it was in the initial consultations. So there was that launch of the drafts and all the health units were asked to provide feedback."" Often managers and front line staff were involved in standards development by providing feedback, or contributing to the writing process. This helped to incorporate a variety of perspectives.

There was an association between POC testing and the antibiotic prescribing decision within 24 h after the result. POC testing also produced results considerably faster than laboratory-based assays. We did not investigate whether the POC results actually influenced decision making and the association with the prescribing decision may only reflect that the FilmArray® result was available before the antibiotics were prescribed and not that the prescriber considered the FilmArray® result in their decision making. Similar percentages of patients Analysed with a negative binomial regression All models adjusted for age, sex, Charlson and Potts scores, day of week, and admission values of WCC and CRP and used multiple imputation to account for missing data. The CURB-65 score was not available for 59% of patients, and was therefore not adjusted for in statistical models. There was less than 5% missing data for all covariates. Missing outcome variables 1) Antibiotics within 72 h and 2) Antibiotics at any time: missing data for 13 patients in the control arm and 10 patients in the intervention arm, 3) Time to antibiotics in the first 72 h: missing data for 1 patient in the intervention arm, 4) duration of antibiotics: missing data for 4 patients in the control arm and 13 in the intervention arm, 5) readmission: missing data for 1 patient in intervention arm, 6) mortality: missing data for 1 patient in intervention arm Control arm de-escalate: 2 stop ≥1 antimicrobial, 3 substitution of Beta-lactam with narrower spectrum Beta-lactam. Intervention arm de-escalate: 2 stop ≥1 antimicrobial, 2 substitution of Beta-lactam with narrower spectrum Beta-lactam, 2 substitution of Beta-lactam with narrower spectrum Beta-lactam and atypical agent was stopped. Control arm escalate: 4 add antibiotic to existing antibiotics (all agents against atypical pneumonia). Intervention arm escalate: 19 add antibiotics to existing antibiotics (14 agents against atypical pneumonia, 5 addition of agents against 'typical pneumonia' to atypical agent e.g. Beta-lactam or teicoplanin with ciprofloxacin if penicillin allergic), 7 substitution of Beta-lactam with broader spectrum Beta-lactam received antibiotics in both study arms. There were no significant differences for the remaining secondary outcomes between the two study arms. The hypothesis was that POC testing would reduce the length of stay. However, though the POC test was 1 day faster than laboratory-based testing, the results were available later than anticipated. This was not due to testing performance of FilmArray®, which took only 65 min but related to a delay in the processing of the specimen by the clinical staff on the ward. Sixty-eight percent of POC tests were performed by study investigators reflecting the fact that the study protocol was not initiated by clinical staff as soon as the patient was admitted to the study ward in many cases. Instead testing was delayed until the study investigators visiting the study wards initiated the study protocol. This resulted in a significant delay in time to results. This is in contrast to a trial of MRSA POC screening by our AMU ward staff that had a TAT from admission of 3.7 h [20] . MRSA testing is mandatory and most patients were eligible for inclusion. The delay in the present study may be related to screening for more complex eligibility criteria than the MRSA study and an additional reliance on study investigators present on the ward to perform the test. If this is the case, the TAT would be faster if FilmAr-ray® was embedded as a routine, diagnostic POC test. When ward staff did perform the test, they were from all grades and they performed it without incident. Others report a TAT of 2.3 h for FilmArray® POC testing, though the TAT was from the time of decision to test to the time of result and testing was conducted by trial staff [21] . Thus FilmArray® POC testing can be successfully implemented but this study failed to achieve the optimum TAT.",9.883550439942239,8.935059011115555

DINC is a customizable approach, allowing for the use of different combinations of parameters and heuristics. In this context, one set of parameters chosen for a particular job (i.e., one execution of DINC) is referred to as a DINC protocol. From previous experience, we define a default protocol for DINC (Fig. 3) . This protocol represents a reasonable selection of parameter values for a standard job, but it is not expected to provide the best results in all situations. Therefore, in our re-docking experiment, four alternative protocols were defined, exploring other combinations of parameter values. The specific parameter values in these five protocols (including the default protocol) are presented in Supplementary Table S2 . It is important to highlight that we do not exhaustively evaluate all possible protocols. For example, DINC protocols also comprise the specific parameters of the underlying docking software, in this case AutoDock 4 (Fig. 3) . In our experiment, The five protocols are used in the following way: First, a total of 20 DINC jobs is executed for each of the 25 complexes in the dataset (Supplementary Table S1 ), using the default protocol (Fig. 3) . The output conformation with the lowest binding energy for each complex is compared to the corresponding reference structure. If the all-atom RMSD between them is lower than 2 Å, this is considered a good reproduction of this complex. If not, a new batch of 20 DINC jobs is executed using the next alternative protocol. This process is repeated until a good reproduction is obtained, or the five protocols have been used (which corresponds to 100 jobs).",10.137093542579589,8.796093201137902

The development of sensitive and specific multiplex molecular testing methods will be necessary to address the topics raised here, since in contrast to septic arthritis the number of non-culturable bacteria found in the joints of patients with chlamydial and other ReA is usually quite low. In our experience DNA extraction methods and PCR protocols must be adapted to the SF and ST milieu to reach adequate levels of performance [51] [52] [53] [54] . We assume that research laboratories will develop and test protocols designed for use with joint samples for the identification of Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, and enteric. This approach was applied to the simultaneous detection of Mycoplasma spp. in SF samples from patients with RA by multiplex PCR [50] . (4) . Translation of research protocols and data into clinical practise requires the development of commercially available test kits adapted for SF analyses. The Anyplex II STI-7 kit (STI-7, Seegene, Eurobio)-marketed to simultaneously detect C.tr., Mycoplasma spp., and Ureaplasma spp. involved in sexually transmitted infections-has identified coinfections in patients screened for genital infection and thus gives promise that the development of multiplex RT-PCR assay for the use in rheumatic patients can be realized [55] . Adaption for joint samples will be needed; our earlier observations demonstrated that commercial assays developed for urogenital samples allow the detection of C.tr. in clinical specimens, but they do so with a lower sensitivity than do our in-house developed omp1-specific PCR in concert with optimised sample preparation of SF [56] . (5) . Chlamydiae are disseminated in monocytes/macrophages from the original site of infection by peripheral blood. They settle into the joint as shown by demonstration of chlamydial DNA in PBMC preparations from patients with ReA and undifferentiated SpA [3, 57] . Hence, an important additional research topic centres on investigation of peripheral blood for detectable coinfections in patients with arthritis. The development of commercial multiplex PCR assays for peripheral blood testing is of great importance for rapid diagnosis, and to overcome the limited availability of joint samples in every day clinical practise.",10.34481199710633,6.520451955449312

The legacy of the Global Virome Project will probably consist of the countermeasures, diagnostics, vaccines, policies and systems that it enables.

While the use of molecular diagnostic assays for detection of influenza virus infection at hospital and associated commercial laboratories increased modestly since 2006-2007, the availability of influenza molecular diagnostics for clinical care at hospitals was still limited; only 26% of hospital laboratories reported availability of molecular diagnostic assays. Laboratory diagnostics for respiratory viruses other than influenza and RSV were uncommonly available. Also, a minority of hospitals included in our survey had policies in place to systematically test patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) seen in the ED with influenza diagnostics during influenza season. As the number and type of commercially available laboratory diagnostics for respiratory pathogens evolve, an updated survey is warranted. We showed that in most (67%) hospitals included in FluSurv-NET, a U.S. population-based surveillance network involving 15 states, RIDT was the clinician's primary or only option for influenza diagnostic testing. RIDTs are easy to use and have rapid turnaround time for results. However, RIDTs have been shown to have suboptimal sensitivity (40-70%) compared to RT-PCR or viral culture. [10] [11] [12] [13] Several studies suggest that healthcare providers are more likely to prescribe antiviral drugs with a positive RIDTs. 13, 14 Therefore, a falsenegative result may affect clinicians' decision to provide appropriate treatment and infection control among patients with influenza. Given the suboptimal sensitivity of RIDT, patient management should not depend upon a positive RIDT result. If patient management depends upon a diagnosis (or rule out) of influenza, additional confirmatory test with a more sensitive assay is warranted and the initiation of antiviral treatment and implementation of infection control should be started empirically and not delayed while awaiting confirmation. 15 In our survey, only 31% of laboratories had protocols for confirmatory testing with a more sensitive assay following a negative rapid test result. This may reflect the limited usefulness of receiving testing results late in clinical care. Also, in our survey, the laboratories confirming RIDT test results reflects shipment of specimens to state public health laboratories as part of FluSurv-NET surveillance, in addition to clinician practice.

A broad restructuring of the poultry distribution system would greatly help to reduce environmental contamination and thus risk of transmission in both poultry and humans. Key changes would include a shift from rLBMs to cold-chain distribution, and introduction of a centralized slaughter system with standardized, hygienic practices for slaughter, decontamination, and waste processing. These changes are more difficult to implement in some countries because of the cultural and social importance of rLBMs as well as the ever-changing animal-trade network which involves many small businesses. Nevertheless, policies that require standardized poultry supply activities, with minimal stay-times of birds in any specific holding and minimal transfers between holdings before entering rLBMs are essential to control the transmission of AIVs in poultry populations, and thus prevent the emergence of novel strains. Systematic sampling and testing in a geographically representative sample of large Chinese wLBMs should be undertaken urgently.

The resulting growth restoration assay is robust, highly sensitive, quantitative, cost-effective and technically simple. We found that the yeast growth inhibition was greatest for WT, giving rise to a good Z' factor for screening. Because a successful drug should inhibit WT M2 as well as amantadine-resistant mutated forms, we use WT in the primary screen followed by testing of active compounds against mutants in secondary assays. Our screen of over 250,000 pure chemicals and semi-purified fractions from natural extracts identified only 21 active compounds. This 0.008% hit rate is 10-to 100-fold lower than typically encountered in screens for other targets. The assay shows high selectivity for M2 channel inhibitors as further testing of the 21 active compounds revealed no false positives. In positive readout cell-based assays, high selectivity is imparted largely by the requirement for active compounds to both inhibit their target and not hamper cell growth, effectively eliminating many non-selective active chemicals. However, since we have observed higher hit rates in yeast growth restoration assays with other targets [46] , the very low hit rate and the paucity of chemical classes identified indicates that M2 is not easily inhibited by the drug-like synthetic chemicals assembled in commercially available libraries. Natural products are known to encompass a much wider range of biologically relevant chemical space, so we were surprised that our large-scale screen of semi-purified fractions obtained from natural extracts did not yield a single hit. We do not believe this is due to technical factors such as testing of the fractions at too low a concentration to reveal activity [47] . Rather, we think this indicates that the M2 channel can be selectively inhibited by very few pharmacophores and that it is a challenging target for drug development. Nonetheless, the screen identified two compounds with novel structures for M2 channel inhibitors -hexamethylene amiloride 14 and triazine 18. Further testing in the TEVC assay confirmed that hexamethylene amiloride 14 inhibited the M2 channel, and subsequent SAR evaluation of amiloride analogs showed that hydrophobicity played a critical role in M2 channel inhibition. Hexamethylene amiloride 14 is a known inhibitor of the mammalian Na + /H + exchanger [48] , and is also active against the HCV proton channel p7, the HIV-1 Vpu ion channel and the SARS Coronavirus envelope protein ion channel activity [49, 50, 51] . Hexamethylene amiloride 14 inhibits the mammalian Na + /H + exchanger with an apparent K i of 0.2 mM [52] , more potently than it inhibits M2 in the yeast assay (EC 50 = 1 mM) and therefore does not appear to be a good drug candidate. An azolo-1,2,4-triazine derivative has been described as an inhibitor of influenza A and B virus replication [53] , with an uncharacterized mechanism of action. Triazines 18, 33 and 34 described here are considerably different and have not previously been linked to the inhibition of ion channels. Triazine 34 completely inhibited influenza A replication at 10 mM and was not very toxic to MDCK cells (CC 50 = 75 mM). These compounds may be good starting points for drug discovery. The high sensitivity of this yeastbased assay also revealed that the spiroadamantane amine shown in Fig. 2 is not only highly potent against the amantadine-resistant V27A mutant as reported [26] , but that it is a 3-fold more potent inhibitor of the WT M2 channel than amantadine and rimantadine, and may therefore be a candidate for drug development. Together, these results demonstrate the value of the yeast growth restoration assay for high throughput screening of M2 inhibitors and discovery of anti-influenza agents.",7.313201538785631,7.509456399304188

The antiviral screening system should meet all requirements of any good assay, including validity, lack of ambiguity, accuracy, reproducibility, simplicity, and reasonable cost. Moreover, because we are dealing with plant extracts, the antiviral screen should be highly selective, specific, and sensitive; it is advisable to discriminate a true antiviral activity from a viricidal one at this stage. Because most of the aforementioned requirements are better met by in vitro testing, we not only prefer in vitro screening of the plant extracts, but also the use of the same bioassay to guide the isolation of the antivirally active compounds from the plant extracts. The antiviral activity of the pure compounds then has to be confirmed in a later stage by in vivo assays (Leven et al., 1982; Vanden Berghe et al., 1986) .",9.585976419588379,9.131014629412848

At present, genetic screening for this group of conditions is only recommended in certain circumstances (for example, cascade testing from known cases (Lynch syndrome and FH) or testing for women at high risk, because of their family history). 12 Caution is urged before expanding use of such tests to people at 'population-level' risk, because the positive predictive value of any variants found would be much lower, and they would be harder to interpret. The development of genetic screening programmes at all these life stages in the UK at least is constrained by application of strict screening criteria designed to ensure optimum health benefit with least harm for the population as a whole. For example, only two inherited metabolic conditions (PKU and mediumchain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency) are screened for in newborns in the UK, whereas around the world >50 conditions are identified as being detectable through the new method of tandem mass spectrometry. After much debate and a 2-year pilot programme, a further four conditions will be added in England from November 2014. However, further pressure to expand programmes will undoubtedly arise as a result of such powerful new genomic technologies that enable faster, cheaper and safer examination of the genome and the possibility of looking for many conditions at once (Table 2) . Public health professionals will have an important role to play in this decision-making but, to do so they will need sufficient understanding of these new genomic technologies, the underlying science and the relationship of molecular pathologies to the diseases are in question. This must be complemented by skills in epidemiology, evidence and cost-effectiveness; their wider awareness of social implications such as stigmatization and the likely effects of new screening programmes on the organization of health services.",11.351547717641479,8.612534975863237

Bacteriology panels are composed of sampling sites and lists of the primary pathogens and opportunists to be found at these sites. Pathology panels specify the tissues and organs to be examined. Several panels may be defined for a species in order to reflect the frequency with which certain infectious agents have been found. In the case of serology, basic profiles that include commonly found viruses are performed more often than are comprehensive profiles to which rarely detected agents have been added. Next, test protocols are constructed by combining assay panels with the appropriate samples.

For example, taking isolation and quarantine, there needs to be consideration of the level of transparency with which such policies are enacted and enforced, proportionality in the imposition of these policies compared with the benefits they offer and the assurance of a safe and habitable environment for persons subject to these measures (Gostin, Bayer, & Fairchild, 2003) .",9.953270972935796,6.905187461186403

For many years, the approach was an annual Pap test. In 2000 the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test (Qiagen/ Digene) for detection of HR HPV types was approved by the FDA for screening women who had ASCUS detected by the Pap test to determine the need for colposcopy. At the time, the Hybrid Capture 2 test was the only FDA-approved test available. In 2003, the FDA approved expanding the use of this test to include screening preformed in conjunction with a Pap test for women over the age of 30 years, referred to as ""co-testing."" Co-testing allows women to extend the testing interval to 5 years if both test results are negative. 160 In 2014, the FDA approved the use of an HR HPV test (cobas HPV test, Roche) for primary cervical cancer screening for women older than the age of 25 years, without the need for a concomitant Pap test. When using the HR HPV test as the primary screening test, a Pap test is performed only when specific HR HPV types are detected (HPV-16 and -18 are excluded). Colposcopy is performed without an intervening Pap test in women who test positive for HPV-16 and -18. This algorithm was based primarily on the results of a single large FDA registration study for the cobas HPV test. 161 Interim clinical guidance is available for the use of primary HR HPV testing in cervical cancer screening. 162 However, there is still considerable debate about whether co-testing or HR HPV as a primary screening test is the optimal approach for cervical cancer screening. 163 Four tests for the detection of HR HPV types have been cleared by the FDA for use in the United States: HC2 test, Cervista HPV HR (Hologic/Gen-Probe), cobas HPV test (Roche), and Aptima HPV test (Hologic/Gen-Probe). In addition, two different FDA-cleared tests to specifically identify HPV types 16 and 18 (Cervista) and types 16 and 18/45 (Aptima) are available.

Symptom-based screening for influenza has inherent limitations to its sensitivity, as a proportion of those infected with influenza will be asymptomatic on arrival and some people with symptoms will not report them. Although sensitivity and PPV can be traded off to some extent, in this study the use of any screening criterion with reasonable sensitivity (e.g., > 80%) would mean that more than 15% of travelers would require further testing. Until highsensitivity rapid tests are available, these travelers would all require isolation pending influenza test results, although fewer than 10% of those thus isolated are likely to be infected. In addition, some arriving passengers who are infected with influenza will not be detected at the border. This includes those whose infection was not detectable on arrival and those missed by screening-the latter alone would be 0.2% of travelers in this study (using criteria with 80% sensitivity, 20% of the 1.13% infected would not be detected).

The high cost was addressed in 2003 by making free HIV testing available for the poor, 63 and later, under the Four Free and One Care policy, antiretroviral treatment was made freely available for all through the Chinese health system. The number of screening laboratories has been expanded to 5500, and there are now 99 laboratories able to do confi rmatory HIV tests. Free HIV testing has been made available, and expanded from 365 counties in 15 provinces in 2002 to over 2300 counties, with 3037 sites, in all provinces in 2006.

Cunha, MD, Uzma Syed, DO, Stephanie Stroll, MD, Nardeen Mickail, MD, and Marianne Laguerre, MD BACKGROUND: In spring 2009, a novel strain of influenza A originating in Veracruz, Mexico, quickly spread to the United States and throughout the world. This influenza A virus was the product of gene reassortment of 4 different genetic elements: human influenza, swine influenza, avian influenza, and Eurasian swine influenza. In the United States, New York was the epicenter of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic. Hospital emergency departments (EDs) were inundated with patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) requesting screening for H1N1. Our ED screening, as well as many others, used a rapid screening test for influenza A (QuickVue A/B) because H1N1 was a variant of influenza A. The definitive laboratory test i.e., RT-PCR for H1N1 was developed by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) and subsequently distributed to health departments. Because of the extraordinary volume of test requests, health authorities restricted reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Hence most EDs, including our own, were dependent on rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) for swine influenza. A positive rapid influenza A test was usually predictive of RT-PCR H1N1 positivity, but the rapid influenza A screening test (QuickVue A/B) was associated with 30% false negatives. The inability to rely on RIDTs for H1N1 diagnosis resulted in underdiagnosing H1N1. Confronted with adults admitted with ILIs, negative RIDTs, and restricted RT-PCR testing, there was a critical need to develop clinical criteria to diagnose probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia.",9.290066893098473,7.681591607450645

Ideally, this should occur soon after arrival and includes rescreening for TB, mental health screening, and testing for HBV, anemia, and sexually transmitted infections such as HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. It should also confirm, either through the overseas documentation or testing, that the appropriate presumptive anthelminthic therapies were administered. Finally, this evaluation is meant to identify chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and update vaccinations. In many regions of the United States, the local health departments have assumed the responsibility for following-up newly arrived persons with TB within 30 days. However, for non-TB conditions, there is a wide range of models at the state and county levels, and many parts of the country rely on primary care physicians to perform the domestic evaluation. In reality, it is likely that a large proportion of refugees do not receive the recommended evaluation. 17 Even for TB, the actual rates of follow-up after arrival ranged from zero (Montana) to 100% (Delaware) with a median rate of 75% in 2009. 12 Unless there is clear documentation of prior screening and treatment, primary care providers may consider a conservative approach and not assume that any part of the domestic evaluation was previously performed.

The individual with HIV has weakened defenses against invading organisms and is susceptible to opportunistic infections which, left untreated, ultimately lead to death. HIV created a huge dilemma for boxing and the other sports in which bleeding can occur. After concerned physicians advocated safer protocols, mandatory testing was initiated early followed by recommendations to stop a bout until bleeding was controlled. 68, 69 Safety measures such as universal precautions and mandatory testing were incorporated quickly by most boxing commissions. In boxing, guidelines for excessive bleeding were easy to implement because controlling bleeding is always an important objective for strategic and psychological reasons. Excessive blood cannot only impair vision but distract a boxer if he is constantly trying to wipe it away. Some boxers will also display diminished skills at the sight of their own blood. Overall, the two preventative strategies of testing and bleeding control seem effective in minimizing the incidence of boxing-related transmission of HIV. There is no evidence that HIV can be transmitted through saliva, sweat, or tears, 68 so there is no danger associated with normal body contact such as touching and sharing sports equipment or towels. Also, contaminated surfaces such as ring mats, toilet seats, and hot tubs do not pose risks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of transmission of HIV during sports is small and there are no documented cases of HIV contamination during sports. 70 Evidence exists suggesting that the baseline risk of HIV may be higher in competitive athletes. This evidence seems more related to ''risky'' lifestyle behavior including increased alcohol consumption, inconsistent contraceptive use, and multiple sex partners than the inherent risks of the sport. 71 Intramuscular injection of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs constitutes another HIV risk behavior associated with athletes. The case of a body builder with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) suggests that like in the general population, contaminated needles are also a source of HIV infection. 72 There is a report of HIV seroconversion as a result of bleeding during a soccer match in Italy. 73 After further investigation, transmission through nonsports activity could not be ruled out because the man involved also worked in a drug dependency rehabilitation program. There are also some case reports of HIV transmission during bloody street fights. 74, 75 These events should not be compared with boxing, because they lack the rules and regulations that minimize the dangers and limit morbidity and mortality. Evidence of HIV infection can be found by testing for the antibodies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and Western blot test). Unfortunately, the tests do not become positive until 3 to 4 weeks (sometimes even months) after infection. Quantifying HIV RNA level (viral load) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is 95% to 98% sensitive for HIV, becomes positive within 11 days of infection. 76 At present the ELISA and Western blot tests are the accepted screening tests for boxing. A possible way to strengthen the current protocols may be by mandating viral load testing and including amateur as well as professional boxers. Justifying a change in tests may not be easy because antibody testing is the accepted standard and seems to be working well. There is no denying that that in King amateur bouts the chance of HIV transmission through lacerations is less, but not impossible, with the use of headgear. However, nose bleeds are very common and could increase the risk of transmission. Testing amateur boxers may not be cost effective but it would make the disease-screening process more thorough. There is some opinion that the physical demands of the sport would limit participation by athletes infected with HIV. 77 The opposite may be true, with the exertion from boxing training potentially being beneficial for an individual with HIV. 78 Finally, with the current regimen of medications that are able to minimize the viral loads, a boxer with HIV may be able to compete without any obvious limitations and it may not be detectable with the current screening methods. There is a famous case of a boxer diagnosed with HIV who continues to fight professionally. His case is unusual because his initial test was reported positive but subsequent tests have all been negative. It is uncertain whether he was the victim of a false positive, or for whatever reasons, his virus is presently undetectable. At present most professional boxing commissions are not willing to take a chance and allow him to continue competing in their states.",12.290343437726865,9.24523904914404

These housing systems are beneficial in decreasing the likelihood of disease transmission, but they also make it harder to detect infectious agents based on random screening protocols because the agent distribution is not uniform and the prevalence of infection may be far below 30%. Another problem with random screening techniques is the impracticality of selecting and testing animals from active research colonies without disrupting the ongoing research. For this reason, it is common to place sentinel animals into a colony for the sole purpose of health status testing. These animals are not assigned to any particular study, and under ideal circumstances they will be exposed to the same agents as the principal animals actually being used for research or breeding. Because they exist solely for the screening program, sentinels can be bled, sampled, or removed for nonsurvival testing at the discretion of the colony management without interfering with ongoing experiments.",17.37327729595716,10.166149093971207

If a case of lice occurs, children, their families, and child-care staff must be screened. Infested individuals may return to the child-care setting after treatment. Although some centers require ""no nit"" poli- cies, which state that children be free of nits before returning to child care, these policies have not been shown to be necessary in control of head lice. Machine washing or drying with hot temperatures is recommended to disinfect clothing, bedding, and cloth toys because lice and eggs are killed by temperatures exceeding 53.5""C.

A structure-based VS approach integrating docking and pharmacophore based methods was employed to computationally screen 621,000 compounds from the ZINC library. The screening protocol was validated using known 3CLpro inhibitors and was optimized for speed, improved selectivity, and for accommodating receptor flexibility. Subsequently, a fluorescencebased enzymatic HTS assay was developed and optimized to experimentally screen approximately 41,000 compounds from four structurally diverse libraries chosen mainly based on the VS results. False positives from initial HTS hits were eliminated by a secondary orthogonal binding analysis using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The campaign identified a reversible small molecule inhibitor exhibiting mixed-type inhibition with a K i value of 11.1 μM. Together, these results validate our protocols as suitable approaches to screen virtual and chemical libraries, and the newly identified compound reported in our study represents a promising structural scaffold to pursue for further SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor development.",10.233423902440816,9.530675466703437

Chamberlain et al. used infrared emission based thermometer for normal ear temperature determination in various age groups [131] . The outbreak of pandemics like severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and avian influenza has paved the way for effective utilization of IRT based techniques for mass screening of fever [42] [43] [44] 132, 133] . Recently IRT was used successfully for mass screening of fever in subjects with SARS, a highly infectious disease caused by coronavirus [134] . Chiang et al. also reported similar results [135] . Screening of potential infected subjects is a primary requirement for prevention of mass spreading of SARS. Ng studied the effectiveness of IRT in mass screening of fever. He concluded that elevated body temperature is one of the most common syndromes of many infectious diseases, including SARS and hence IRT is a powerful tool for initial mass screening of subjects during public health crisis [136] . Nishiura and Kamiya used IRT for entry screening of passengers at Narita international airport in Japan during influenza (H1N1) pandemic during 2009 [137] . Bitar et al. described the effectiveness and potential use of IRT for fever screening during epidemics and presented an elaborate literature review on the topic [41] . Ring et al. observed that, the highest atrisk group in case of a pandemic fever is the children and performed IRT based studies for detection of fever in children [138] . They reported that, IRT can be considered as a potential tool for fever screening and found that, the temperature of the axilla (measured by conventional thermometer) and that of the inner canthi of the eyes (measured by IRT) were highly correlated. The studies further indicated that temperature above 37.5°C, with ± 0.5°C tolerance for the measurement system, must be considered as possible indication of fever instead of 38°C as reported earlier.

Many donors are also screened for nosocomial infections such as methicillinresistant Staphylcoccus aureus or vancomycin-resistant enterocci. Because infection can be transmitted via transfusions, serologic testing is typically performed both before and after a potential donor receives blood products.

The acceptance of organs from donors with known infections with or exposure to HIV, hepatitis, or other viruses remains controversial. 21 Given that the number of transplant candidates on the waiting list far exceeds the number of available organs, strategies to expand the donor pool include accepting donors with certain infections, higher-risk serological profiles, and social histories suggestive of prior exposure to bloodborne infections as well as donors who may be more at risk for transmitting infections (eg, older donors and donors with long ICU stays). 20 Informed consent ",9.850353032749503,9.344071482261581

[3] [4] [5] [6] Hawaii, Maryland, and New York permit unconsented HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure only if source patients are unable to consent for testing because they are absent, deceased, comatose, or lack capacity to consent.

While the advent of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP, preventive medication taken soon after a needlestick or other exposure to patients' blood) has substantially reduced the risk of acquiring HIV, using PEP comes with its own risks. According to published guidelines, PEP should be taken only when source patients are HIV-positive or have risk factors for HIV. 1 Initiating PEP when source patients are uninfected puts exposed persons at risk from taking toxic drugs with no compensating benefit. Forgoing PEP if the source is infected carries a greater risk of acquiring HIV. On one side of a debate are those who would argue that in all cases, HIV testing should be performed only after the source patient is given pre-test information and provides his or her voluntary informed consent. Others would argue that, when an exposed health care provider is put at risk either of acquiring HIV or needlessly suffering toxic effects from PEP, an exception from normal informed consent practice should be permitted. Still others would argue that unconsented HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure can be justified on the balance of harms and benefits to both source and exposed persons. How can emergency physicians decide which of these HIV testing practices is most appropriate? One place to turn is laws or policies governing HIV testing in cases of occupational exposure; however, these typically come with little or no explanation or justification. Whenever laws or policies depart from the well-established ethical imperative to respect patients' rights to informed consent, it is critical to subject such departures to rigorous ethical analysis.

Conservative ABV-consensus PCR-protocols focus on the detection of the M-, N-, P-, or L-Gen, [35] [36] [37] with the M-and N-protocols appearing to have a higher sensitivity. 57, 100 For an additional quantitative analysis of viral amount real-time RT-Taqman-PCR were initially developed for the detection of ABV-4 (Primer 1034-1322) and ABV-2 (Primer 1367). 35 As with all PCR protocols, the primers are able to detect specific gene sequences. As a result of the high variability of ABV, it should be kept in mind that those primers might fail to detect a specific ABV genome despite its presence because alterations in the specific gene sequence occurred. Therefore, negative PCR results should be interpreted in the context of the kind of PCR that has been used and, balanced with serologic results, the clinical picture in the patient or the potential occurrence of novel genomic variants. Enderlein et al 88 demonstrated that commonly used real-time RT-PCR protocols were not able to detect all known ABV genotypes. Similarly, an ABV-2 variant from cockatiels was not detected in the previously described realtime RT-PCR protocols 35 but by a conventional consensus RT-PCR, 98 making it necessary to alter the real-time RT-PCR protocol for detection. As ABV-4 and ABV-2 are the most common genotypes in psittacines, it seems fair to use those protocols in an initial diagnostic step. However, as stated earlier, in negative but suggestive cases, or to increase the confidence in the interpretive meaning of the results, further protocols should be applied. If focusing on the detection of ABV from other bird families (e.g., waterbirds, songbirds), specific PCR protocols need to be used. 52, 69 Therefore, the laboratory receiving the samples should be able to handle the different PCR protocols that may be required and will need to know the origin of the sample. Additionally, laboratories need to be very experienced in handling samples for ABV or BDV investigation, as it is known that cross-contamination with Bornaviridae-RNA occurs more easily compared with other viruses. It cannot be overstated that ABV detection is a specific task that requires experience and that it is not easy to establish compared with other diagnostic PCR systems as commonly thought by veterinarians or commercial laboratories. Additionally, the details of sample selection, collection, storage, and transport to the laboratory surely can affect the results obtained. Commonly used samples are crop and cloacal swabs, feces, feather calamus, and blood. Feces carry certain disadvantages when used in PCRs, as inhibitors are commonly found in those samples. In a comparison of samples from 55 known ABV-positive psittacines, in 36 birds crop and cloacal swabs were positive for ABV-RNA, whereas in 11 cases only the crop and in 8 cases only the cloacal swab were positive. None of the whole blood samples of those birds were positive by PCR. 88 As a conclusion, a combined sample, including crop and cloacal swabs from one bird, merged in one tube for testing seemed superior for ABV detection in live birds. Interestingly, a recent study identified a high ABV-RNA content in urine, 74 potentially explaining the good results with cloacal swabs. Some authors suggest the feather calamus as a good sample, 101 but this view is not supported by the experience of some laboratories or by experimental studies, demonstrating other tissues more often positive. 62 Additionally, feathers always contain a higher risk of being contaminated by other birds or the environment, leading to false-positive results. In dead birds, brain or retinal tissue is the most superior sample for the detection of ABV-RNA. 62 Additional postmortem samples for viral detection might be the adrenal gland, proventriculus, and ventriculus. After collection, the samples should be stored in a cool environment or ideally placed in a special transport media (RNAlater, Quiagen) to be sent to the laboratory, as RNA within samples are sensitive to degradation, and false-negative results might occur because of poor transport conditions. The samples should reach the laboratory within a few days. In case samples need to be stored longer or are frozen, they should not be thawed and should reach the laboratory in the frozen state. Repeated thawing and freezing cycles degrade the RNA very quickly. The veterinarian should always keep in mind that a negative result of the sample might not automatically mean an ABV-negative bird. Apart from a false-negative result (e.g., sampling issues, loss of detectable viral genome as a result of transport), the sample might just not contain ABV-RNA because at the time of sampling the virus was not present in that location. This is a common problem, especially in live birds, as ABV is shed intermittently in some birds. 56 In tissue samples, the virus might not be in that particular tissue and may be found elsewhere (e.g., the brain). Especially in live birds, repeated testing might be recommended (see below).",9.326131395051302,8.318746072095928

Methods: International passengers arriving at 18 U.S. airports from Asia, Europe, South America, and Canada were assigned to one of three states: not infected, infected with PI, infected with other respiratory illness. Passengers passed through layered screening then exited the model. 80% screening effectiveness was assumed for symptomatic passengers; 6% asymptomatic passengers. Results: In the first 100 days of a global pandemic, U.S. airport screening would evaluate over 17 M passengers with 800 K secondary screenings. 11,570 PI infected passengers (majority asymptomatic) would enter the U.S. undetected from all 18 airports. Foreign airport departure screening significantly decreased the false negative (infected/undetected) passengers. U.S. attack rates: no screening (26.9%e30.9%); screening (26.4%e30.6%); however airport screening results in 800 Ke1.8 M less U.S. PI cases; 16 Ke35 K less deaths (2% fatality rate). Antiviral medications for travel contact prophylaxis (10 contacts/PI passenger) were high e 8.8 M. False positives from all 18 airports: 100e200/day. Conclusions: Foreign shore exit screening greatly reduces numbers of PI infected passengers. U.S. airport screening identifies 50% infected individuals; efficacy is limited by the asymptomatic PI infected. Screening will not significantly delay arrival of PI via international air transport, but will reduce the rate of new US cases and subsequent deaths. ª a v a i l a b l e a t w w w . s c i e n c e d i r e c t . c o m j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r h e a l t h . c o m / j o u r n a l s / t m i d Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease (2009) 7, 181e191",9.193386410286632,6.946274194234324

Novel inactivation protocols, such as UV and gamma radiation [46] or the use of hydrogen peroxide [13] , have already been mentioned in the literature but will need thorough testing and standardization before they can be employed in the context of influenza vaccine production. There are currently new emerging technologies to manufacture influenza vaccines that would not require an inactivation process, such as production of IAV proteins on in vitro cultures or peptides derived from IAV proteins, all showing promising results; yet, egg cultures are currently the cheapest and most efficient way to produce high amounts of vaccines in a relative short amount of time. Therefore, until a new vaccine production method that can compete with the egg culture is developed, inactivation will be a standard procedure in vaccine manufacturing. Our results are therefore a call for establishment of more detailed inactivation procedures for vaccine manufacturers, and for a search for different and more efficient inactivation methods to be included in the international guidelines.",9.921229185105762,6.898713586235534

Regardless of which test is used, when analyzing results it is important that the sensitivity and specificity of the test is understood (Gardner et al., 2000) . The test specificity reflects the percentage of animals that are negative for the disease that the test accurately reports as negative, whereas the sensitivity reflects the ability of the test to identify truly positive animals. Regardless of the test used, false-positive and false-negative results will occur on occasion. Increased numbers of false-negative results may be seen during the early periods after formation of an SPF colony, whereas more false positives may be reported after the colony is established (Mansfield, 2005) . Confirmational testing should always be performed at a reference laboratory when positive or questionable results are reported.

Combined HIV antibody plus p24 assays (ie, fourth generation assays) are in widespread use as initial screening assays and the Association of Public Health Laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommend them as initial screening tests for diagnosis of HIV infection [225, 226] . The testing algorithm associated with their use does not require Western Blot. Instead, individuals with reactive results are further tested with an antibody immunoassay that distinguishes HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies. If the differentiation assay is negative, further testing with a qualitative or quantitative NAAT is recommended to rule out acute HIV-1 infection. If the differentiation assay is positive, viral load testing (and usually also CD4 determination) is recommended to direct management. An alternate approach is an initial HIV antigen/ antibody combination assay that discriminates detection of antigen from antibody; p24 reactivity is subsequently confirmed by NAAT and antibody reactivity by an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation assay. The traditional laboratory diagnosis of nonacute HIV-1 infection (Table XIV-1) begins with screening for HIV-1/-2 antibodies. When testing by the screening assay shows reactive results, confirmatory testing by Western blot is performed. (As an alternative, NAAT testing or a second antibody immunoassay-using different antigenic constituents or based on different principles-may be considered.) An initial positive HIV antibody immunoassay using an oral fluid specimen is followed by an immunoassay performed on blood, serum or plasma, a positive result of which is followed by NAAT or supplemental antibody testing to corroborate infection. A negative blood, serum or plasma result requires follow-up testing as previously described [225, 226] . Using the traditional algorithm, if the Western blot result is positive, the patient is considered to be infected with HIV-1. If negative, testing for HIV-2 antibodies is recommended to rule out the possibility of HIV-2 infection causing the reactive combined HIV-1/-2 antibody result. If the Western blot test is unreadable (ie, due to high background reactivity of the strip), testing with an HIV-1 antibodyspecific indirect immunofluorescence assay or qualitative or quantitative testing for HIV-1 RNA or for proviral DNA should be considered. According to Association of Public Health Laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an HIV-1 antibody Western blot result is interpreted as positive when at least 2 of the 3 following bands are present: p24, gp41, and gp120/gp160. If only one of these bands is present, the result is indeterminate, and additional supplemental testing with an HIV-1 antibody-specific indirect immunofluorescence assay, an EIA for HIV-2 antibodies alone, and a qualitative HIV-1 RNA and/or proviral DNA assay should be considered. Causes of indeterminate Western blots include evolving antibody profiles, specimen contamination, antibody decline with immune system failure (late stage infection), nonspecific reactivity due to viral or cellular protein components, other infections (eg, syphilis, other retroviruses, some parasites), immune-modulating conditions (eg, pregnancy), and infection with groups N, O, or P HIV-1, or HIV-2. High-risk patients with reactive serologic screening test results and indeterminate Western blots but negative supplemental tests should be considered for retesting two to four weeks later. If this does not resolve the issue, additional supplemental testing (eg, NAAT) may be considered. Western blot assay is less sensitive than third or fourth generation EIAs during seroconversion with up to three weeks following a positive fourth generation assay before a positive Western blot assay. Since as many as a third of healthy HIV-uninfected blood donors have indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot assays, they should not be ordered as the first test for HIV. Line immunoassays incorporating HIV-1 and HIV-2-specific recombinant proteins and/or synthetic peptides (compared to purified proteins separated by electrophoresis used in Western blotting) are alternatives to Western blot assays.",11.434572070468732,9.721026702096307

For dental pain, third molar extraction is the industry standard for testing analgesics [118] , and common methods have been described. Upper respiratory tract pain and visceral pain, however, present challenges to researchers.

If a nontreponemal test is being used as the screening test, it should be confirmed, as a high percentage of false positive results occur in many medical conditions unrelated to syphilis. When both test results are reactive, they indicate present or past infection. However, for economic reasons, some high-volume clinical laboratories have begun using automated treponemal tests, such as automated EIAs or immunochemoluminescence tests, and have reversed the testing sequence: first screening with a treponemal test and then retesting reactive results with a nontreponemal test. This approach has introduced complexities in test interpretation that did not exist with the traditional sequence [174] . Specifically, screening with a treponemal test sometimes identifies persons who are reactive to the treponemal test but nonreactive to the nontreponemal test. No formal recommendations exist regarding how such results derived from this new testing sequence should be interpreted, or how patients with such results should be managed. To begin an assessment of how clinical laboratories are addressing this concern, CDC reviewed the testing algorithms used and the test interpretations provided in four laboratories in New York City [174] . Substantial variation was found in the testing strategies used, which might lead to confusion about appropriate patient management. A total of 3664 (3%) of 116 822 specimens had test results (ie, reactive treponemal test result and nonreactive nontreponemal test result) that would not have been identified by the traditional testing algorithms, which obviate additional testing if the nontreponemal test result is nonreactive.

Although bacterial colonies were not actually grown for quantification, CFU estimates based on microscopic review of a smear prepared from the sentinel unit suggested that ≥1.38 × 10 3 CFU/μL (1.38 × 10 6 CFU/ mL) was needed for a positive result, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the 10 2 -10 3 CFU/mL described for human blood.21 Beside being cost prohibitive to screen all collected units, it would be challenging to use PCR testing as a screening tool for bacterial contamination of all animal blood products because they are often used immediately after collection, on-site testing of units shortly before transfusion would not be generally available, and samples would need to be shipped to specific reference laboratories for 16S PCR testing, thus delaying results by 1-2 days. The assay may prove useful, however, for testing units that are approaching expiration or for following up units in which a color change has occurred or which resulted in transfusion reactions. Moreover, the PCR product can also be sequenced, permitting precise bacterial species identification. If 16S PCR testing is unavailable, screening tools such as evaluation of color change, Gram stain, and monitoring of pH and glucose concentration, as well as bacterial culture at 37°C and 20°C may prove useful.7 , 20 , 35",11.592499926406937,7.2270324907219194

Introduction: Current screening for B. burgdorferi-infections relies on a two-tier strategy combining sensitive EIA screening with specific immunoblot confirmation. Objectives: To compare the performance of a single step beadbased system with the conventional two-tier approach. Materials and methods: Unselected sera which were sent to a private commercial laboratory for primary serological screening were tested for IgG and IgM by recombinant antigen EIA; reactive samples were confirmed by recombinant immunoblot (recomWell and recomBlot Borrelia, Mikrogen, D-Neuried). Sera were considered positive if reactive for at least one specific plus one non-specific band and indeterminate if reactive for just one specific band. Following storage at )20°C samples were batchanalysed by Luminex-bead-based assays (recomBead, Microbionix/Mikrogen). For IgG, seven antigens (p100, VlsE, p39, OspC from three strains, and p18) were tested, for IgM, three OspC-antigens from three strains were tested. An internal standard curve allowed for normalization of individual immunoglobulin concentrations. For IgG, samples were considered positive if positive for at least two bead-regions and indeterminate if positive for one bead-region.For both systems, positive interpretation was based on presence of IgG (± IgM) and negative interpretation was based on absence of both IgG and IgM. Other situations were considered indeterminate. Results: 667 sera were analysed. Agreeing interpretations for conventional and Luminex testing were found for 514 (77.1%) samples: 65 positive, 104 indeterminate, 345 negative.3 sera were positive in conventional and negative in Luminex testing, 9 were negative in conventional and positive in Luminex testing.56 were indeterminate in conventional and negative in Luminex testing. 61 were negative in conventional and indeterminate in Luminex testing.

However, each of these interventions had a substantial delay before implementation. The blood banking system is already heavily burdened with multiple testing steps and stringent donor screening (Fig 2) . In the United States, blood is tested for antibodies to HIV-1/2, human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-I/II, HBV, HCV, and Treponema pallidum, the spirochete that causes syphilis. Testing is also performed for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and for HIV-1, HCV, and WNV nucleic acids (implemented under investigational new drug application process). 3 Furthermore, it is likely that nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HBV, hepatitis A virus, and parvovirus B19 nucleic acids will be added to the requirements over the next several years. [4] [5] [6] Moreover, the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) recently issued a requirement for accreditation in 2003 mandating the testing of platelet components for bacterial contamination. 3 Although it is clear that there is a continual need to develop new technology to protect the safety of the blood supply, it is also clear that adding new tests and/or donor restrictions for each known and emerging pathogen is not feasible.

However, attempts to identify a protease inhibitor universally active against multiple lentivirus PRs revealed that a statine-based inhibitor LP-130 96 and a C2symmetric competitive inhibitor identified as TL-3 93,592 were both capable of inhibiting PR expressed by HIV-1, SIV, and FIV. Interestingly, comparison of crystal structures of FIV PR and HIV-1 PR in complex with TL-3 reveals differences in the position of the flaps in FIV PR and HIV-1 PR, whereas complexes of FIV PR and HIV-1 PR with inhibitor LP-130 are nearly identical in conformation. 593 Recent reports have shown TL-3 to inhibit FIV and HIV-1 replication and to be active against protease inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 mutants in vitro. 93, 592 Furthermore, TL-3 treatment of FIV-infected cats reduced virus load and disease, including clinical neurologic dysfunction and severe acute phase immunodeficiency. 343, 594 These findings support further testing of TL-3 in combination drug protocols for FIV infection both in cell culture systems and in vivo.

First, all researchers (public and private sector) have access to the screening centers through the NIH X01 and R03 funding mechanisms [6] . Second, due to the diverse source of assays and the wide expertise available within the MSLCN, specific biological systems investigated and screened will include: (a) ''high risk'' targets, that is proteins or biological systems whose function is unknown; (b) targets implicated in orphan diseases or diseases not typically addressed by the private sector; (c) novel or uncommon assay systems (e.g., zebrafish, high content screening); and (d) ''non-druggable'' targets, such as inhibitors of aggregation and protein-protein interactions. Third, the small molecule screening library contains structures not typically found in commercial collections or those housed in pharmaceutical companies. Sources of these unique structures include natural products and novel compound libraries prepared by academic investigators through the Pilot Scale Libraries (PSL) granting mechanisms [7] , compounds generated by the Centers for Chemical Methodologies and Library Development (CMLD) (vida infra) [8] and those obtained through solicitation by the NIH [9] . Fourth, as the goal of the MLSCN is to develop selective chemical probes and small molecule tools that will interrogate novel biochemical pathways, the criteria for an acceptable class of molecules is broader for the MLSCN than for those involved in drug discovery and development. Therefore, chemical probes are not subject to the same constraints on physical properties, functional groups or metabolic profiles that are common in the pharmaceutical industry, and necessary for successful clinical candidates. An example of a compound that would fit the definition of a valuable chemical probe, but which would not adhere to the commonly prescribed criteria of ''drug-like'' is a staurosporinederived ruthenium complex, shown below, which is a selective, sub-nanomolar inhibitor of the kinase, Pim1 [10] . Fifth, and particularly important for this review, is the inclusion of integral medicinal chemistry within each MLSCN Center, that allows the network to produce chemical probes with particular properties, rather than simply identifying apparent activities from the screening collection. Finally, unlike all other screening efforts in both industry and academia, all data are available in PubChem with no delay in publication. In addition to HTS protocols and primary screening results, secondary assay data, ''profiling data'' (e.g., aggregation evaluation, Cytochrome P450 inhibition, spectroscopic profiling, solubility measurements), follow-up compound libraries and their associated biological data, and synthetic protocols are accessible.

PARASITE SCREENING. Screening for parasites is usually accomplished by a subgross or microscopic examination of parasite niches. The three general classes of parasites that infect rats include ectoparasites (mites and lice), endoparasitic helminths (pinworms, other nematodes and cestodes), and endoparasitic protozoa. For ectoparasites, the pelage can be collected and examined for mite or louse infestation. Most protocols suggest allowing the sample to cool to encourage mites to venture to the tips of the hair shaft in search of a warmer host.

These housing systems are beneficial in decreasing the likelihood of disease transmission, but they also make it harder to detect infectious agents based on random screening protocols, because the agent distribution is not uniform and the prevalence of infection may be far below 30%. Another problem with random screening techniques is the impracticality of selecting and testing animals from active research colonies without disrupting the ongoing research. For this reason, it is common to place sentinel animals into a colony for the sole purpose of health status testing. These animals are not assigned to any particular study, and under ideal circumstances they will be exposed to the same agents as the principal animals actually being used for research. Because they exist solely for the screening program, sentinels can be bled, sampled, or removed for nonsurvival testing at the discretion of the colony management, without interfering with ongoing experiments.",18.382088862842025,10.667341505532459

OTHER TESTING STRATEGIES. Historically, other testing platforms were employed, including stress testing for C. pil(forme (Fries and Ladefoged, 1979) or P. carinii (Armstrong et al., 1991) . These tests may still be used as a diagnostic tool or for the characterization of a novel pathogen, but they are rarely if ever used in routine health monitoring. Moreover, certain strains of rats, such as gnotobiotic or axenic rats, may require additional tests, such as flora confirmation, that can be coupled with health monitoring. Table 16 -4, adapted from Livingston and Riley (Livingston and Riley, 2003) , lists agents commonly tested for in rat health monitoring programs and methodologies used to test these agents. g. SCREENING OF TISSUE BY HISTOLOGY FOR LESIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. A variety of tissues may be screened for lesions indicative of infectious disease. While there are very few pathognomonic lesions of rodent infections, screening of tissues may provide presumptive diagnoses that can be confirmed by other means. The disadvantages of histology as a screening tool include the narrow window of opportunity to detect certain transient infections and the fact that many opportunistic pathogens do not cause histologic disease. Screening of tissues may be useful in several situations: l) screening of target tissues for known lesions of infectious disease; 2) screening immunodeficient rats in which tests such as serology are not appropriate; 3) detecting disease early in its time course prior to the development of detectable antibody; 4)detecting bacterial agents that are difficult to cultivate (such as CAR bacillus and Clostridium piliforrne); and 5) detecting emerging or previously unrecognized infectious diseases. The latter is exemplified by the recent discovery of rat respiratory virus. This agent was discovered after the recognition that chronic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia became prevalent in several colonies of rats (Simmons and Riley, 2002) . In addition, it is only by histopathology that noninfectious degenerative conditions, such as renal and cardiac calcinosis, may be recognized.",13.282896197139312,9.727531833156625

Vaccination generally does not interfere with testing; however, blood samples drawn immediately following vaccination may contain detectable FeLV vaccine antigen. 166 It is unknown how long this type of test interference lasts; FeLV testing should always be performed before vaccination.

The roles and responsibilities of all human and animal laboratory staff need to be defined, documented, and communicated, and written policies and procedures should be available and understood. In addition, all laboratory staff should be trained on these policies and procedures to ensure they are executed in a consistent and reliable manner. Accurate and reliable test results depend on having a sample that has been collected, stored, and transported correctly; sample requirements vary by the disease and suspected pathogen. Laboratories should be designed to optimize workflow, support the quality of testing, and protect the safety of laboratory staff and the community. Regularly conducted proficiency testing helps to monitor the quality and performance of the laboratory.",12.411308536663066,8.330603495644572

This comparative analysis of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assays evaluates their clinical sensitivity and presents their C T values to enable a robust comparison of diagnostic assay performances on NPOP specimens under our testing conditions. Although C T values from different assays can be affected by various assay components and platforms used, our analyses of 34 URT specimens showed the TIB MolBiol® LightMix assays to be the most sensitive (94.12%), followed by the Anyplex™ Seegene and GeneSig® protocols. Discordant results between the assays were seen with those specimens containing low virus concentrations (high C T values), reflecting differences in the limits of detection (LOD) . Evaluating the LOD is critical to preventing underdiagnoses of MERS-CoV infections, and should be a consideration when selecting a commercial assay for routine diagnostics. For these purposes, the European Virus Archive has produced quantitative standards for UpE and Orf1a. However, we were unable to obtain these standards during this investigation. Nevertheless, the TIB MolBiol® LightMix and GeneSig® protocols (Assays 2-3) produced some single gene-positive (indeterminate) results, which in a clinical diagnostic setting would require further confirmation by screening a secondary specimen (ideally from the LRT where a higher viral load is expected) before overall interpretation as ""MERS-CoV negative"". Additionally, the GeneSig® and Anyplex™ Seegene assays also produced several negative classifications for our sequence-confirmed specimens.

On a local healthcare organizational level (e.g. hospital, clinic, long term care facility), technologies that have policies, procedures and processes embedded within electronic health records may not be consistent with emerging international and national knowledge about the disease. These technologies may in turn lead health professionals to engage in activities and workflows that are not consistent with the current knowledge of the disease. Healthcare organizations must modify their technologies to support disease management. This is a continuous, iterative process as information about the emerging disease is pushed out by international organizations and governments via websites and social media and healthcare organizations respond by modifying their HIT to reflect these changes in order to support health professional decision-making and work activities.",10.160618104395876,5.745049421241049

Despite best efforts to screen for potential infections and in a timely manner, the transplanting physicians and organ recipients must understand there always remains a risk for infectious transmission. The goals of screening donors and recipients prior to transplant are to identify conditions that disqualify the donor or recipient from the transplant, to identify and treat active infections pre-transplant, and to allow for risk mitigation strategies to minimize posttransplant infections. Screening occurs in many forms including acquisition of a careful history, detailed physical examination, detection of latent or unknown active infections by laboratory testing, examination Residual risk is the rate of undetected infection depending on risk factor and testing strategy. and pathologic evaluation of the organ at the time of procurement and implantation, and posttransplant monitoring of recipients. There are policies that have been developed by the OPTN that mandate which screening tests must be done in all donors and recipients (see Tables 8-5 The indirect ELISA is used to detect antibodies (i.e., HBcAb) while the sandwich ELISA is used to detect antigens (i.e., HBsAg). In the indirect ELISA ( http://www.paho. org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=10 &Itemid=40743 ), a known antigen is fi xed to the bottom of a plastic surface, usually a multi-well plate. Serum is then added and if antibodies that react to the antigen are present, they bind to the antigen. The plates are then washed and a detection antibody (usually an anti-IgG or anti-IgM antibody) that is conjugated to a substrate-specifi c enzyme is applied to each well. After washing, a substrate is then applied and is converted by the enzyme conjugated to the detector antibody, typically resulting in a colorimetric change. The intensity of this change provides a semiquantitative measurement of the presence of the antigen-specifi c antibody. To detect an antigen, a sandwich ELISA is used in which a capture antibody (one which is specifi c for the antigen of interest) is bound to the plates. The patient's serum is applied and if antigen is present, it is bound by the capture assay. The plates are then washed and antigen-specifi c antibodies are applied-creating an antibody-antigen-antibody sandwich. Detection antibodies and substrate are added as above and the resultant colorimetric change is read. Both of these methods have relatively rapid turnaround times, are not subject to a signifi cant risk of contamination, and can usually be done by either an automatic machine or with minimal technical skills.",11.607208945116295,10.945173673049919

In general, there are two types of donors: living and deceased donors. The major differences between these donor types are the potential quality of the donor history and the time frame during which donor screening may take place. In the case of living donation, the actual donor is interviewed, which may allow for collection of a more accurate medical and behavioral history. The quality of the medical and behavioral history is more challenging in deceased donation in which the histories are obtained from friends and family members who may not know all of the medical or behavioral details-especially if there was limited contact between the donor and the historian. Often, the clinical circumstances leading to the death of the deceased donor may contribute to this limitation-often donors are found down and accurate history about the preceding events may be limited [ 13 , 15 ] . Likewise, donors may have undergone extensive resuscitation and/or a prolonged hospitalization that will affect donor screening and infectious risk-secondary to hemodilution as discussed above or by introduction of infection at the time of transfusion [ 7 , 11 ] . There may be a signifi cant time frame between initial screening and organ donation in the case of a living donor. As such, consideration of repeat testing closer to the time of the transplantation should be considered, and current policy recommends that HIV, HBV, and HCV screening of all living donors be performed within 28 days of the transplant [ 65 ] . When time allows, donors may be treated for potentially transmissible infections, such as latent TB, prior to the transplant, decreasing the transmission risk. Lastly, the period of time between initial evaluation and transplantation allows one to screen living donors with risk factors for contracting blood-borne viral infections, such as HIV, HBV, and HCV. In increased risk living donors, as defi ned by the 2013 Public Health Services Guidelines [ 20 ] , counseling to abstain from the increased risk behaviors and repeat NAT and serologic testing over a period of time similar to the window period for the virus of interest should be considered to minimize the risk of an occult transmission [ 20 ] .",11.048221654385932,10.213407801927838

This improved sensitivity should enable us to significantly decrease the infection window period, allowing for earlier detection of the infection and diminishing the chances for transmission of the agent via transfusion.

Although there are no universally accepted guidelines, 2 methods can be used: (1) it can be assumed that MDRO carriers are colonized permanently and require the use of contact precautions for all hospitalizations; alternatively, (2) an interval free of hospitalizations, antimicrobial therapy, and invasive devices (6-12 months) followed by documentation of clearance can justify discontinuation of contact precautions. 1 This method may be more cost-effective, because data suggest that most patients clear MRSA colonization within months to years. Clearance can be proved with 3 negative nasal swabs for MRSA culture while off antibiotic therapy; alternatively a single nasal swab with MRSA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is effective.

Traditionally testing has consisted of initial screening with an inexpensive nontreponemal test (ie, RPR), then retesting reactive specimens with a more specific, and more expensive, treponemal test (ie, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination). If a nontreponemal test is being used as the screening test, it should be confirmed, as a high percentage of false-positive results occur in many medical conditions unrelated to syphilis. When both test results are reactive, they indicate present or past infection. Many high-volume clinical laboratories have reversed the testing sequence and begin the testing algorithm first with a specific treponemal test, such as an EIA or chemiluminescence immunoassay, and then retesting reactive results with a nontreponemal test, such as RPR, to confirm diagnosis. Screening with a treponemal test can identify persons previously positive, treated, and/or partially treated for syphilis as well as yield false positives in patients with low likelihood of infection. If the follow-up confirmation test (RPR) is negative, it requires the laboratory to perform a different treponemal-specific test to guide management decisions (ie, fluorescent treponemal antibodyabsorbed) [194, 204] . Treponema pallidum cannot be seen on Gram stain and cannot be cultured in the routine laboratory.

Though microtitre ELISA is a simple and convenient screening method, it will detect only MAbs that bind to target antigen coated on to a microtitre plate. Owing to their unique specificity and properties, the MAbs detected in this way may not be suitable for use in other applications. They may not, for example, react with native antigen in immunohistopathology (immunocytochemistry), with antigen in solution in sandwich (capture) ELISAs, or irreversibly bind antigen when acting as an immunoadsorbent. An example of this phenomenon was described by Thiriart et al (1986) , who had difficulty in obtaining neutralizing MAbs against bovine rotavirus when using an ELISA system for screening hybridoma supernatants. His group therefore developed a rapid sensitive rotavirus neutralization assay and adopted it for direct screening of primary hybridoma supernatants.

The WHO recommends the Xpert test for those suspected of having drug-resistant TB or in HIV; however, culture is still the mainstay and is not replaced by the Xpert test. TB skin testing (Mantoux testing) uses a purified protein derivative injected under the skin. Its advantages are that it can be used for large-scale screening and it is cost effective. Skin testing does have several disadvantages when used as a diagnostic test. Reading the induration requires training and immunodeficiencies can alter the magnitude of the induration.

Because of the large and ever increasing number of protocols available, several factors should be considered and discussed with caregivers on a case-by-case basis in making the choice of protocol. These factors include the cost, time commitment, efficacy, toxicity, and experience of the clinician with the protocols in question. With the increased availability of generic drugs, protocols are becoming affordable to a larger segment of veterinary clients. In general, more complex combination chemotherapy protocols are more expensive, more time-consuming (i.e., requiring repeated office visits and closer monitoring), and more likely to result in toxicity than simpler, single agent protocols. However, as a general rule, more complex combination protocols result in longer remission and survival durations than single agent protocols. The earliest treatment protocol used in veterinary patients was a non-doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy (i.e., cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone [CVP]), a relatively simple, easy protocol that is well-tolerated and results in a 60% to 70% CR rate and a median survival time of 6 to 7 months. 187,188 However, it has been clearly established that the standard of care combination protocols used in dogs with lymphoma include doxorubicin, and all are essentially variations on the CHOP protocols previously discussed and listed in Table 31 -3. Although many of these CHOP protocols include L-asparaginase, which is added either at initiation or at varying times throughout the protocol, several studies have confirmed that the addition of L-asparaginase in induction protocols does not result in clinically relevant increases in remission rate, speed of attaining remission, or first-remission duration; therefore its use is best reserved for rescue situations (discussed later). 128,190,219,220 Regardless of the veterinary CHOP-based combination protocol used, they all generally result in an 80% to 90% CR rate with median survival times of 12 months. About 25% of dogs are long-term survivors (longer than 2 years), and some are cured. The CHOP protocol used by the authors at the time of publication (Box 31-3) generally is well tolerated by dogs.

A husband's neglecting/abandoning her if diagnosed with breast cancer is a woman's greatest fear and barrier to screening/early detection, a major reason for rising breast cancer morbidity and mortality in Malaysia. Thus, MENCARE!, focusing on men advocates to empower women for breast cancer screening, has been implemented. MENCARE! trains men working in public and private corporations to provide support for women's breast cancer screening. Project effectiveness was evaluated by assessing changes in policies and procedures in one public agency and changes in men's knowledge, attitudes on breast cancer, and actions to support women's breast cancer screening, using multistage pre & post advocacy evaluation design with mixed Methods: One month and one year post-training evaluation of 75 male advocates through questionnaire surveys and 3 focus group discussion (FDG) were conducted. In-depth interviews were conducted with 5 management personnel pre and one-year post advocacy. Organisationally, while existing health package within the agency still did not include breast cancer screening, it would support all cancer treatment 100% at the one year post-advocacy. The flexible time-off procedure for male staff needing to support spouse/family for breast cancer screening continued a year later. ""Many of them have gone for screening"" was observed by one personnel interviewed one year post-advocacy. Request for a mobile mammography clinic on-site was made by management a year later. Individually, the training increased male staff's knowledge of breast health, cancer and screening in certain though not all aspects. The training increased their willingness to be involved in all types of support for women: to discuss/motivate women to get early and complete treatment, to prepare types and levels of support. Yet, men expressed some problems: lack of awareness/ exposure to what is commonly regarded as a women's disease/ problem; embarrassed to talk about women's breasts; lack of screening facilities and medical insurance, especially in rural areas; and men's busy work schedule. Buying in of public or private corporations and targeting male support at the work-place appears strategic in addressing women's delayed or low uptake of breast cancer screening through changes in organisational policies and procedures as well as individual changes in knowledge, attitudes and support actions.

This resulted in development and implementation of algorithms to convert blood regions from pooled to more sensitive individual-donation (ID) testing during intervals with WNV activity in donors. 23 These triggers have evolved while recognizing the operational burden inherent in testing ID aliquots. A 2008 AABB Association Bulletin recommended that ID-NAT be triggered when two presumptively viremic donors are seen within a rolling 7 days. It made recommendations for establishing at-risk donor populations within a collection area, that WNV activity and donor testing be monitored in real time and converted to ID-NAT within 48 hours of reaching a trigger, and that ID aliquot testing continue for a minimum of 7 days with no viremic donors. 24 Six additional cases of transfusion-transmitted WNV have been recognized from 2004 through 2011. 25 For perspective, these occurred against a background of more than 20,000,000 blood components transfused annually. These cases were attributed primarily to insensitive triggers and inefficient communication between neighboring centers. Accordingly, triggers have been continuously reassessed, and in some systems a single viremic donor in the presence of other WNV activity in a community may be used to implement ID screening. In addition, again based on models from CDC, some systems extend ID screening for 2 weeks or more beyond the last viremic donation. 26 Communication in the blood safety community has been reinforced, for example, using processes that include e-mail notification trees, daily examination of the AABBWNV Biovigilance Network website and other public health WNV surveillance sources.

[41] [42] [43] [44] It has been suggested that a clinically useful test has an AUC ≥ 0.75. 45 Considering the reconstructive consequences of delayed diagnosis, a false negative result could harm patients. [15] [16] [17] With the availability of non-invasive tests which definitively determine the presence of an ARmD, we see no role for using blood ion levels to diagnose symptomatic patients. 18 Screening is the process of identifying high-risk patients in the general population. Since screen-positive patients will undergo further testing, screening tests need not be as accurate as diagnostic tests. Screening can use two different approaches: exclude patients with very low probability of disease from further testing by maximising the negative predictive value (Npv), or identify highrisk patients for further testing by maximising the positive predictive value (ppv). 46 the performance of ion testing using these two approaches is shown in table II. Calculations were made using the SRoC curve plotted in Figure 3 and using the mean prevalence of ARmDs in the studies included in this review (41%). Indeed, maximising Npv is burdensome because 99% of patients will test positive. Furthermore, test-positive patients have the same probability of disease as they did prior to undergoing the test. on the other hand, maximising ppv does not reassure test negative patients because they still have a 21% probability of having an ARmD. test-positive patients are hardly ""high risk"" because the risk of an ARmD is marginally different from the pre-test probability (52% versus 41%). Aside from statistical concerns, screening for ARmDs is problematic on theoretical grounds. the World Health organization recommends that screening only be performed if patients will be offered treatment. 47 We are unaware of any evidence supporting revision on asymptomatic patients with ARmDs and thus screening would serve no clinical purpose. We have synthesised the totality of evidence for the diagnostic value of metal ion levels for ARmDs in patients with mom hip implants. We conclude that blood ion levels have no role in the diagnostic algorithm for ARmDs. the probability that we have incorrectly calculated the AUC to be less than 0.75 is 1.7%. Given the strength and consistency of the findings of our meta-analysis, and the improbability that the results of our meta-analysis are incorrect, further study of metal ion testing for the diagnosis of ARmDs would be an inefficient use of research resources.",11.83401896043938,7.1275876573673145

This should also include a careful review of the medical history from different sources, including surviving family members, hospitals, clinics, and private doctor's offices. Other records such as blood donation history or autopsy records can also be obtained. The next step in donor screening is testing for an active infection. There are limitations of tests that rely on the presence of antibodies or antigens, such that there is a window period where the donor is actively infected but exhibits no detectable immunologic response. NAT reduces the window period from 22 days (HIV) and 70 days (HCV) to 7 days. 13 With current screening and testing protocols, the estimated risk of implanting tissue from an HIV-infected donor is 1 in 173,000 to 1 in 1 million. The estimated risk of implanting tissue from an HCV-infected donor is 1 in 421,000. 18 The risk of contracting hepatitis is much higher than the risk of HIV. The estimated prevalence of 1.2 million with hepatitis B and 3.2 million with HCV 19 is responsible for the increased risk. The incidence of HCV in the general population is 1.8%, and many of these patients do not know that they are carriers. Furthermore, 50% of carriers have no history of hepatitis or even know that they are seropositive. 20 The actual numbers of potential tissue donors that are infected with these viruses are unknown, and these numbers do not take into account the processing steps to reduce the risk of disease transmission.",12.77115548363987,6.919030579418759

A further study found an infectious window period of 56 days from infection to detectable antibody conversion by the first-generation screening assays. 8 Later improvements in the sensitivity of antibody assays reduced this preseroconversion infectious window period to approximately 3 weeks, and the subsequent additions of p24 antigen and its replacement with nucleic acid testing (NAT) virtually eliminated this window, resulting in current risk estimates of approximately 1 infectious unit per 1.5 million transfused units. In fact, six transmissions have been reported in the United States since 1999, when NAT was implemented, during which time from 13 to 17 million whole blood (WB) donations per year were processed and distributed.

The endosomal cathepsin L is an appealing target for antiviral development, because it mediates viral entry by triggering the fusion of the plasma membrane with endosomes via proteolysis [75, 76] . The DCG-04 ABP revealed that the tetrahydroquinoline oxocarbazate inhibitor was cell permeable and reduced the activity of cathepsin L by 38% [41] . These findings demonstrate a potential role for DCG-04 ABP for identifying novel inhibitors, such as oxocarbazate inhibitor CID 23631927 that is a subnanomolar, slow-binding, reversible inhibitor of human cathepsin L, which prevents SARS and Ebola virus entry into human cells [41] . Further applications of the DCG-04 ABP could be to explore the mechanisms of viral entry and screen for other potent inhibitors.

However, MERS-CoV has spread sporadically to other areas, including Europe, North America, Africa, and Southeast and East Asia, by travelers from the Middle East. 5 The laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection is mainly performed using real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA in specimens.

Laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases were medically isolated and ususally prescribed oseltamivir treatment. Their close contacts were quarantined for 7 days and usually prescribed oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis. Imported pandemic H1N1 cases were sporadically identified from late April to June. On 11 June 2009, following identification of the first untraceable local pandemic H1N1 case, the Hong Kong government initiated a ""mitigation phase"" and announced immediate class dismissal in primary schools, kindergartens and childcare centers for 14 days starting from 12 June 2009. The school closures were subsequently extended to summer vacation in early July. Some containment phase policies, such as medical isolation of confirmed cases and contact tracing of airplane passengers, continued through June. On 13 June 2009, 8 public outpatient clinics were converted to designated flu clinics across the territory to provide low-cost highthroughput outpatient medical consultation, free laboratory testing for pandemic H1N1, and antiviral treatment. These public outpatient clinics resumed some chronic disease services in mid-August. Figure 1A shows the epidemic curve of notified pandemic H1N1 cases and associated hospitalizations from May through October 2009. Under containment-phase protocols, all laboratory-confirmed cases until 28 June were medically isolated in hospitals, and recorded as hospitalizations in the e-flu database. We therefore analyzed only the 5279 hospital admissions from 29 June to 31 October. The cumulative proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases that were hospitalized fluctuated around 15% during the early stages of the epidemic ( Figure 1B) . After the designated flu clinics resumed chronic disease services and laboratory testing was focused on more severe cases, the cumulative proportion of cases hospitalized gradually increased to around 18% by the end of the study period. Figure 1C shows the estimated R t based on pandemic H1N1 notifications from late May through October. The estimated R t reached an initial peak of 1.5 on June 12 and fell below 1 between June 20 and July 3. Subsequently R t fluctuated between 0.8 and 1.3 through the school vacations in July and August. R t briefly increased to around 1.2-1.3 after schools reopened in September until the epidemic peaked in late September, and subsequently fluctuated below 1 as the epidemic declined. The trends in R t based on H1N1-associated hospitalizations were broadly consistent with the estimates based on case notifications, with wider confidence intervals ( Figure 1D ).",11.516964016587778,9.119903167467251

This policy includes identification and treatment of carriers, isolation or cohorting of MRSA-positive patients, strict hygiene policies, screening contact persons, and closure of wards. Countries that use this policy, The Netherlands and Scandinavia, have a low MRSA prevalence, which is an indication for the success of this approach (Wertheim et al., 2004) . But this policy is costly and there is little evidence about the necessity and efficacy of its individual components. Mathematical models suggest that a subset of measures may suffice to control MRSA prevalence in low-endemic settings. The models indicate that in a high-endemic setting appropriate measures can reduce MRSA levels (Bootsma et al., 2006; Pan et al., 2005) . A serious threat to the feasibility of this policy is the emergence of MRSA in the community, as this may have huge consequences for the capacity of a hospital to screen and isolate patients in order to maintain the search and destroy strategy.

Often this method is used for economic reasons; testing a large number of pooled specimens with one test is generally far cheaper than testing each animal individually. This is the case where the additional individual diagnostic test adds considerable cost, but the specimen is relatively cheap and readily available (e.g. milk). Pooled specimen testing is particularly useful as a screening test for the absence of disease or where disease prevalence is low. While pooling offers a method of investigating the disease status of a large population quickly (Lanyon et al., 2014a) , there are two points important to note. Firstly, when testing for the presence of a condition/factor or pathogen, pooling only makes sense if it makes testing more cost-effective or less time-consuming than individual testing. If the prevalence of the factor of interest is higher than the dilution factor caters for, all pools will be positive, and nothing has been gained. For example, if you pool 20 animals/ pool for BVDV virus testing and the disease prevalence in the population is 1-2%, 80% of pools are likely to screen negative, saving time and money. However, if you test 100 specimens/pool from the same population, all pools are likely to be positive, and you are no closer to identifying which animals are infected. By contrast, a run of 100 specimens is within the analytical capability of a PCR assay. Secondly, the diagnostic test also needs to possess sufficient analytical sensitivity to detect the antibody or antigen at the dilution factor determined by the degree of pooling. Usually an additional safety factor is added to ensure this. When testing for antibodies to EBL, the greatest dilution allowed for pooling is 10 times less than the highest dilution of a standard positive that can be detected e.g. if the standard can be detected diluted 1:100, pools of 10 animals each can be tested (Reichel et al., 1998) .",10.040747573193055,7.555048667962998

In general, the duration of reinduction remission will be half that encountered in the initial therapy; however, a subset of animals will enjoy long-term reinductions, especially if the dog completed the initial induction treatment protocol and was currently not receiving chemotherapy for several months when relapse occurred. Reinduction rates of nearly 80% to 90% can be expected in dogs that have completed CHOP-based protocols and then relapse while not receiving therapy. 232, 300 The duration of a second CHOP-based remission in one report was predicted by the duration of the interval between protocols and the duration of the first remission. 123, 300 If reinduction fails or the dog does not respond to the initial induction, the use of so-called ""rescue"" agents or ""rescue"" protocols may be attempted. These are single drugs or drug combinations that are typically not found in standard CHOP protocols and are withheld for use in the drug-resistant setting. The most common rescue protocols used in dogs include single-agent use or a combination of rabacfosadine, actinomycin D, mitoxantrone, DOX (if DOX was not part of the original induction protocol), dacarbazine (DTIC), temozolomide, lomustine (CCNU), l-asparaginase, mechlorethamine, vincristine, vinblastine, procarbazine, prednisone, and etoposide.

In some states, newborn screening may include genetic tests for a wide range of targets, but the costs and complexities of the newer genetic tests inhibit expansion of newborn screening. We describe the development and technical evaluation of a multiplex platform that may foster increased newborn genetic screening. Methods: MultiCode ® PLx involves three major steps: PCR, target-specific extension, and liquid chip decoding. Each step is performed in the same reaction vessel, and the test is completed in ϳ3 h. For site-specific labeling and room-temperature decoding, we use an additional base pair constructed from isoguanosine and isocytidine. We used the method to test for mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The developed test was performed manually and by automated liquid handling. Initially, 225 samples with a range of genotypes were tested retrospectively with the method. A prospective study used samples from >400 newborns. Results: In the retrospective study, 99.1% of samples were correctly genotyped with no incorrect calls made. In the perspective study, 95% of the samples were correctly genotyped for all targets, and there were no incorrect calls. Conclusions: The unique genetic multiplexing platform was successfully able to test for 31 targets within the CFTR gene and provides accurate genotype assignments in a clinical setting.",13.31217709871847,8.41270396205238

For example, the clinical manifestation of active TB during dialysis is often insidious and atypical,14 as patients with ESRD and TB frequently present with systemic symptoms that are similar to uraemia, which can delay the diagnosis. Patients may also present with extra-pulmonary or disseminated diseases.15 Among patients with CKD, the standard anti-TB treatment involves quadruple therapy, although this is problematic because ethambutol and pyrazinamide are both cleared through the kidney and require renal-adjusted dosing. In addition, rifampicin often interacts with anti-hypertensive, antidiabetic, and immunosuppressive medications, which can necessitate dose adjustments.16 Furthermore, anti-TB medication causes more severe and frequent toxicities among patients with ESRD, including gastrointestinal troubles and decreased appetite, which limits the treatment regimen and duration.17 Screening for latent and active TB infections among patients with ESRD is another important issue for controlling TB. Although the World Health Organization recommends systemic testing for TB among patients who are receiving dialysis or transplantation, there is a paucity of evidence for guiding the screening recommendation, and optimal treatment for latent TB infection is unclear among patients with advanced CKD.

","The 2015 to 2017 ZIKV pandemic is illustrative of the ongoing challenge of balancing timely and precautionary responses to emerging TTI threats with logistic and economic considerations. As the epidemic expanded in the Americas and the association of ZIKV with severe fetal outcomes emerged along with several cases of probable TT, the FDA mandated implementation of individual‐donation (ID)‐NAT or PRT of PLTs throughout the United States in 2016.11, 12 After 2 years of ID‐NAT with very low yield at an annual cost of $137 million, the FDA ZIKV policy was revised to allow for minipool NAT with ID‐NAT triggered during future epidemics, similar to successful screening for WNV. Nonetheless, ZIKV testing now represents a theoretical benefit at a high cost, precipitating consideration of regional screening policies and an urgent need to further define “tolerable risk” in the blood safety arena.20

Speaker's summary: Blood donor screening began in the 1940s with testing for syphilis, followed in the early 1970s by testing for hepatitis B surface antigen. The discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T‐lymphotropic viruses, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and introduction of progressively more sensitive serological assays targeting virus‐specific antibodies and antigens for these “classic” transfusion‐transmitted infections (TTIs) in the 1980s and 1990s was effective in interdicting the majority of infectious blood donations.1 Implementation of NAT screening for HIV, HCV, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) further reduced the residual risk of infectious window period donations, such that per‐unit risks are less than one in 1,000,000 in the United States (Fig. 1).2, 3, 4

As it proved to be safe and efficient for COVID-19 screening, the DT system was adopted by 68 COVID-19 screening centers among 577 centers in Korea (as of March 12, 2020). It took about 10 minutes per one test, which is one third shorter than the conventional screening process. The main time-consuming factor in the conventional COVID-19 screening system is the time required for ventilation and cleaning of the specimen collection room. Designed as an airborne infection isolation room with 12 air changes/hour, it takes around 30 minutes to achieve airborne-contaminant removal efficiency over 99%, and even longer if surface disinfection with sodium hypochlorite is performed.8 However, this time for ventilation and cleaning is not required for the DT screening system because testees' cars are used as specimen collection rooms. At DT screening centers, around 100 tests can be done per day and about four to eight persons are required depending on the design of workflow. The flow can be simplified as two booths of registration/questionnaire/examination/instruction and specimen collection, which requires minimized manpower and PPE consumption. In addition to the improved efficiency, the DT screening system can also exclude the risk of cross-infection between testees at the waiting space of conventional screening centers, for testees' own cars work as isolation units throughout the test course.",9.386586890904674,5.258119044900933

The screening and triage protocols that were implemented in our EDs and clinics [14–16] were critical for the prompt identification and management of these patients. Using epidemiologic screening and decision trees developed by the CDC and Emory [7, 15], the majority of patients were determined to be of low risk for EVD, and they did not require specific Ebola virus testing. Routine Ebola virus testing for all PUI was not practical; furthermore, the imperfect sensitivity of Ebola virus testing in the first 3 days of illness [20] would have limited its utility in ruling out EVD with certainty in the majority of the patients, because most presented within 1 day after onset of symptoms. Given these limitations, the decision of whether or not to perform Ebola virus testing was individually made for each PUI, considering the epidemiologic risk, symptomatology, and duration of symptoms. Therefore, our clinical approach was to carefully evaluate each PUI, rule out other potentially life-threatening conditions, and use Ebola testing judiciously. Because patients who recovered were considered ruled out for EVD, diagnosis and prompt treatment of other suspected or confirmed causes of infection was particularly important during the monitoring period. Although none of our patients were empirically treated for malaria, this might be considered in situations in which the patient is clinically unstable and there is limited ability to perform malaria rapid diagnostic testing.",14.090263793175382,10.629930764691768

We found that most PUI in our series had low suspicion for EVD and could be managed without admission to our ETU or testing for Ebola virus. Other Ebola assessment centers are advised to work closely with their local health departments and institutional laboratory personnel to determine their approach when evaluating PUI for EVD [25], with particular attention to Ebola virus testing and other tests needed for the timely diagnosis of other potentially life-threatening infections. Because PUI may present unexpectedly at numerous clinical sites, we found that screening at all potential sites of patient intake was critical, including the screening of outpatients over the phone when appointments are scheduled. Precautions to minimize visibility of PUI (eg, using an alternative, low traffic entry point to the tropical medicine clinic) were important to protect patient privacy, especially because the level of PPE used may attract excessive attention from patients and staff. Evaluation of PUI in the clinic and ED was time and resource consuming in numerous ways. In addition to enhanced PPE, our protocols required dedicated staffing for each PUI at numbers beyond what is routine in the clinic or ED, and each evaluation typically required several hours total, from the time of triage to final disposition. Because PUI are restricted from using public means of transportation, the transport of PUI also presented challenges when patients lacked personal means of transport. In this situation, close collaboration with the local health department was needed to arrange for ambulance transport using appropriate precautions. Regular practice drills and tabletop exercises were important to train staff and identify gaps in our procedures.

Age-based restrictions limit exposure to children who may have inadequate respiratory hygiene but do not address the role contagious adult visitors play in HARVIs. Limiting the number of visitors to a small cohort of key individuals determined by the family (including children) may be more effective than age restrictions. Washam et al26 recently described a 37% reduction in HARVIs after standardization of visitor restriction policies that included restricting the number of visitors during a hospitalization. It is also important to identify potentially contagious individuals and prevent them from visiting until symptoms improve. A recent study by Mermel et al27 reported relatively fewer HARVIs in units that performed visitor screening compared with units that did not screen. Unfortunately, these investigators did not measure compliance with visitor screening. We implemented a similar process to screen family members and visitors before entry into the NICU. Although Unit Secretaries asked symptomatic family members and visitors to defer visitation, these episodes were not documented, which limited our ability to assess the full effectiveness of the screening process. In addition to screening, during the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 influenza seasons, visitation was restricted to 2 parents/caregivers. This intervention likely provided additional protection for patients. Hospitals must balance the decreased family-centeredness of more restrictive policies with the challenges of implementing visitor screening when developing a visitor management plan.
