That is correct and this observation motivates the introduction of two new statistical complexity measures. We generically call these two variants as 'M-complexities' (with 'M' standing for ''modified''). They have the same functional form as the MPR-Statistical Complexity, but instead of computing the Jensen-Shannon's divergence from a uniform probability distribution we compute it against an ad hoc probability distribution functions derived from the data. In this sense, these measures are more supervised then the MPR-Statistical Complexity is. Another perspective is that the MPR-Statistical Complexity is a special case of this measure in which the ad hoc probability distribution function of reference is the equiprobability distribution. The relevance of this measure derives from being a general definition that allows [44] . Metastatic samples have typically lower values of Normalized Shannon Entropy than normal samples and prostate cancer primary tumors. The reduction in Normalized Shannon Entropy indicates that there exists a significant reduction on the expression of a large number of genes, or that the gene profile of metastatic samples has a more ''peaked'' distribution (due to the upregulation of a selected subset of genes). Both possibilities just cited are not mutually exclusive. We also note that neither the Normalized Shannon Entropy, nor the MPR-Statistical Complexity (as a single unsupervised quantifier), can help differentiate between tumor and normal samples, indicating that other Information Theory quantifiers are required for this discrimination. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012262.g001 accommodating several different reference states.

All of the studies used ward closure in combination with other interventions, and as such, the impact of each measure on outbreak containment could not be determined. Relatedly, there may also have been a potential for a dose-response elationship in studies that increased the extent of ward closure, for example, from closing the unit to select admissions to closing to all admissions. Secondly, there is the potential for selection bias in studies that did not use epidemiological typing and, subsequently, could not confirm that all affected patients were colonized or infected with the same strain of the causative pathogen. Another source of bias stems from the selection of specific outcomes. Furthermore, some of the case definitions relied on the presence of symptoms and did not confirm cases with any diagnostic method or epidemiological typing, resulting in case finding bias. The studies could have also been subject to recall bias as the vast majority of articles are retrospective. As all the articles included in this study reported on successfully controlled outbreaks, it is highly likely that the reviewed literature is vulnerable to publication bias.

Firstly, we need to improve phenotype definitions and criteria for diagnosis, especially in case of latent tuberculosis 13, 67 . The use of proxy and extreme phenotypes, which was seen in HIV, with exposed uninfected subjects, long-term non-progressors, fast progressors and elite controllers [68] [69] [70] , might also provide an interesting step forward 71 . It was very common for authors to use the term ""healthy"" controls, but almost universally used dissimilar diagnostic process for classification of cases and controls. Thus, selection of controls and diagnostics process must be fundamentally improved and harmonized (Supplementary Table 10) . A substantial effort must go towards inclusion of controls that were exposed to a pathogen, which is necessary for the disease development (but may not be sufficient). Data analysis must also be improved, by adhering to the best practices, including the use and report of odds ratios and confidence intervals as measures of association, and multiple testing correction 72 . Improvements can be made in the study design, where availability of finely phenotyped life-long cohorts and biobanks provides an opportunity to use this data in an understanding of life-long risk of developing respiratory infectious disease, such as tuberculosis. The use of novel molecular technologies, various omics, and their application to infectious disease development, progression and outcome (infect-omics) presents an unprecedented opportunity in this field 73 . However, these must be based on evidence-based, always include estimates of repeatability and focus on replication efforts in an unlinked population. Lastly, we must substantially improve results reporting. This refers to the structured manuscript preparation, reporting of all relevant information and manuscript preparation against a given set of criteria like STREGA 74 , STROBE-ME 75 or STREIS, where appropriate 76 . This also extends to the need to develop individual-data public repositories and creation of large-scale consortia that share common standard-operating procedures, similarly to these in chronic disease genetic epidemiology. We do not neglect the proposed finer scale analyses of various population subsets 67 , but we consider improvements in study design to have much stronger potential impact. All these suggestions are applicable not only for genomics, but also for any type of infect-omics studies, defined as application of various -omics technologies in understanding of the infectious disease development, progression and outcome. In addition, we need to start developing framework of systematic reviews, where we need to compare disease-specific genes and pathways to disease-specific genes, as the final outcome, clinical disease, might be attributable to different sets of genes that make a person more susceptible to e.g. pneumonia regardless on the pathogen that is causing it.

Emerging pathogens are distinguished from the next stage, novel potential pathogens, in that there is clear evidence that they can cause disease in humans. Relative to emerging infectious diseases, however, emerging pathogens (in their present state) do not cause significant levels of morbidity or mortality. This is not to imply that they do not have the potential to become an emerging infectious disease; some will and some may never. In many cases emerging pathogens will have been identified as infectious in a single or small number of local cases. Examples of emerging pathogens include many multi-drug resistant microbes. For these pathogens, the potential health impact will vary with the availability and accessibility of treatment options. Another example of an emerging pathogen is Jamestown Canyon virus. Jamestown Canyon virus is a member of the California serogroup of bunyaviruses spread by mosquitoes from the typical cervid reservoir.

This usually requires that the statistical model used to analyse the data is explicitly based on a mechanistic model of disease spread [12] . Transmission parameters of interest, for example, the reproduction number (the number of individuals infected by a case), are usually mathematically defined in those models. Fitting such parametric mechanistic models to outbreak data can give useful insights on transmission [7, [13] [14] [15] , but is subject to the same limitations as parametric fitting in other fields.

However, the decentralization of the response meant that intervention data were not systematically reported or collated and these data were not shared widely with the research community. A failure to report interventions centrally and systematically can make it difficult to disentangle a lack of intervention effect from a lack of intervention implementation. This can particularly be a problem when numerous groups coordinate their own efforts, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions about interventions. In the absence of detailed data on intervention efforts in West Africa, multiple studies have assessed the combined impact of all interventions in place, by comparing transmissibility in the early phase (with no intervention) to that in the later phases [87, 117] .

While the Chinese national government takes the lead to initiate and negotiate bilateral agreements with African countries, the implementation of these agreements rests with China's provincial or subnational governments. In addition, China's existing foreign aid policies are based largely on ad hoc central ministerial documents and regulations, which are not subject to approval by the legislative branch [11] . Furthermore, competition within the Chinese government ministries and at provincial levels further undermines the overall cohesion and coordination of China's aid [12] . For example, individual provincial Chinese governments are designated to provide specific African countries with medical teams, thus, this results in the allocation of different levels of resources to health projects based on provincial interest and their local capacity [13] .

The ITT approach: 1) preserves the effects of randomization, and 2) addresses the practical impact of interventions better than per protocol analyses. Because of potential consequences of missing data, it is a major goal of our trial to keep missing values to minimal. Inevitably, however, there will be some missing values, both in terms of sporadically missing items from those that complete the protocol, and from people who withdraw or are lost to follow-up. Several ad hoc methods for dealing with missing data in clinical trials have been used and were considered. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) To deal with issues involved with participants who withdraw or are lost to follow-up, we propose dividing our subjects into two groups; protocol completers and non-completers. Variables based on these groupings will then be assessed for meeting the assumptions of either MCAR using Little's test (7) or MAR, using procedures proposed by Pottoff, et., al (8) . Contingent upon achieving either MCAR or MAR, the following imputation strategy will be used for our ITT analysis. If the missing values are NMAR, then standard methods of analysis are not valid and usually a sensitivity analysis is recommended. Stage 1 imputation will proportionally randomize protocol non-completers to either a ""no ARI episode"" (zero) designation or to a designation of ≥ 1 ARI episodes, with variable duration and global severity. In the first MEPARI study, 66 of 149 people (44.3%) randomized had at least one ARI illness episode. Stage 2 will then use multiple imputation methods (9) to impute the specific missing values of AUC and duration for those subject imputed to a non-zero ARI illness situation. The issue of sporadically missing data from protocol completers is most relevant to the primary outcome of global severity, assessed as area-under-the-time-severity curve, where the X-axis = duration and Y-axis = severity.",26.15703152962024,10.254568716105055

Therefore, carefully designed randomised sampling schemata should be employed to maximise the power of the statistical techniques used to analyse data, rather than having to reply on data augmentation techniques to work around the problems present in ad hoc datasets. This aspect is particularly important when working on network data derived from population samples. Secondly, any inference on both network and infectious disease models should be backed up by a careful analysis of model fit. Although recent advances in statistical epidemiology have given us an unprecedented ability to measure population/disease dynamics based on readily available field data, epidemic model diagnostics are currently in their infancy in comparison to techniques in other areas of statistics.

Due to the lack of lncRNA functional annotations, researchers may also simply limit downstream analysis to a few lncRNAs that have significant differential expression and/or are highly abundant. Given the limitations of this strategy, we recommend that additional computational analyses may help to guide this prioritization.",23.894671828265857,8.419836478184218

Colonization of strainers or drains reported in earlier studies (7, 10, 13, 24, 37) was perhaps a result of ascending biofilm growth from the P-trap to the strainer or introduction through contaminated fluids. Many of the studies used swab samples, which likely sampled the strainer rather than P-trap water (17, 20) . Once the strainer was colonized, the water from the faucet resulted in GFP-expressing E. coli dispersion in the bowl and to the surrounding surfaces of up to 30 in. The range of dispersal (6) . Greater dispersal near the faucet may be attributed to the specific designs of the sink bowl and faucet in this study, which determine the contact angle of water impact. This is an important finding since many sinks in hospitals are similar in design, with faucet handles representing a high-touch surface for the sink users (38) . It can also be concluded from the dispersion experiments that secondary and successive dispersals would likely increase the degree and the scope of dispersion. There are several limitations to this work. First the use of similar sink bowls across these sinks only examines the dispersion pattern of this particular sink design. Similarly the sink-to-sink transmission may not be applicable to all wastewater plumbing systems as the fixtures on the pipe are very close together, unlike most layouts in health care settings. However, we speculate that transmission could occur on larger systems over greater time scales, especially if heavy nutrient and contamination loads were also included. GFP-expressing E. coli is a laboratory surrogate, and the putative biofilms established in the short time frame of our experiments are unlikely to be as complex or stable as biofilms developed in a hospital wastewater system over many years. However, to address the monomicrobial dominance of the GFP-expressing E. coli added to the system, we kept the system open, and other environmental organisms were able to cocolonize in an attempt to mimic the hospital system. Another limitation was the need to add nutrients to the drain to ensure rapid and robust colonization. We are not clear how widespread the practice of disposing of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids or leftover beverages in the hand-wash sinks is; however, we have observed this practice, and anecdotally it appears to be relatively common in the United States. We also did not completely characterize the droplet sizes, nor do we demonstrate air sampling to understand if the dispersion is only droplet or if there are also aerosols that contain GFP-expressing E. coli. This would require additional testing and is planned as future work.",23.093396405396838,8.540181435775054

Rather than conditioning on a single ''best'' model, AM incorporates and systematically seeks to reduce the scientific uncertainty that impedes success, by integrating over models that encapsulate all of the articulated uncertainties to produce an inclusive decision set. Our simultaneous consideration of three alternative parameterizations of the dispersal kernel of the Keeling and colleagues [13] model and all possible interventions illustrates the expected value of resolving uncertainty about the dispersal kernels in an FMD outbreak, possibly saving millions of pounds in lost livestock. Passive learning and ad hoc adaptation did occur during the 2001 outbreak (the initial DC strategy was altered to CP within about a month); thus there would be no additional logistical burden to an AM approach. Our results show that an AM approach could be employed to realize a good portion (32.85% for case 2) of the EVPI, and provides an objective justification for an initially lesssevere culling regime by minimizing expected costs over the full epidemic, given the option to change management actions in response to the observed progression of the outbreak.

If a transport from holding B to holding C is recorded for time point t, and another transport from holding A to holding B for the time point t + 1, then holding A is connected to both holdings B and C in the monthly static network. However, due to the temporal order of the connections a disease could not spread from A to C. The outgoing contact chain takes this temporal dynamic into account Epidemic outbreaks were simulated using stochastic simulations with 1000 repetitions for each months and each scenario. Surveillance was based on 100 holdings which were either randomly selected from all holdings with an outgoing contact chain larger than 100, from all holdings in the top 5% percentile for one of the static network measures in the respective month, or from all active holdings and, as such, it gives a more sensible network metric reflecting its potential contribution to an epidemic outbreak. We simulated outbreaks with a simple model, which contained two stochastic components: one for the transmission of the disease due to animal transports from one holding to the other, and a second one for transmission due to environmental contamination or other unknown reasons. Yet, targeted surveillance based on the dynamic outgoing contact chain could detect epidemics more often and more effectively than both targeted surveillance based on holdings selected based on static network properties and random surveillance. Our results are in line with recent propositions for selection criteria of surveillance targets based on cluster analysis of the transport network [18, 41] .

Many characteristics were derived from available literature and data sources, but we used assumptions to overcome some information gaps. For all scenarios except scenario 4, the prevalence detection threshold and detection probabilities were set at an ideal level. A lower level of prevalence detection threshold or detection probability using OF may still provide beneficial information at a lower total cost than current testing protocols. Of note, the diagnostic test sensitivity values on OF samples could be outside the range of values used in this evaluation. Lower published rRT-PCR sensitivity values can be found for influenza A virus in swine [42] and other tests used with endemic disease monitoring [43] .

As a baseline or reference, we also considered random surveillance. For this simulation disease was seeded on one randomly chosen holding out of all active holdings of the respective year and disease spread was modelled as a stochastic process with the disease spreading from one holding A to another holding B on a given day with probability p = 0.8 if a movement of animals from A to B occurred on that day. The number of animals transported from one holding to another was not considered here. Incubation time was assumed to be zero, meaning that on the very day when one or more contagious animals were moved to a holding, animals on that holding can get infected and can also spread the disease further if animals were moved to another holding on the same day or later. Additionally, each day the disease spreads to a randomly chosen holding with probability q = 0.05, acknowledging that the disease can also be conveyed by other means than movements of contagious animals. Note that this is a very simple model, not taking into account specific infection dynamics of existing diseases. The parameter values for p and q were arbitrarily chosen, p being a high value and q being a low value. The maximum time for disease spread was set to 30 days with daily updates of infected holdings. Inspired by the work of [41] , for each simulation a small number (n = 100) of holdings was selected as surveillance targets. Surveillance targets were either chosen randomly from all active holdings (random surveillance), randomly chosen from holdings with high scores for one of the six nodal network metrics (top 5% percentile, static targeted surveillance), or randomly chosen from all holdings with an outbreak size of 100 or more (dynamic targeted surveillance). We use outgoing measures rather than ingoing for convenience. A similar analysis could be carried out using the equivalent ingoing metrics however, as our aim was only to compare the performance of static versus dynamic metrics, this should be of no further concern, here. The simulation was repeated 1000 times for each month of the study period. As measures of the effectiveness of the surveillance scheme we evaluated (i) how often the epidemic was detected at one of the surveillance targets within 30 days, and (ii) the number of infected holdings at the time of detection.

The recent emergence of Zika, chikungunya and yellow-fever viruses emphasizes the need for rapid, reliable, and safe methods for analyzing vector competence from various species of mosquitoes. Arboviruses transmit from the mosquito to the vertebrate host via mosquito saliva; hence, collecting mosquito saliva to assess viral titers is an essential activity. Current collection methods are laborious and typically require sacrificing the mosquito, limiting researchers to a single saliva collection time point per insect. Inspired by the hanging blood drop and the field-oriented honey-trap method, they are designing an approach that will allow collection of saliva from individual mosquitoes during routine sugar feeds. They have systematically optimized this assay: including methods of sucrose delivery, housing, timing, and detection of virus from samples. A 3D printed lid covered with organdy turned 12-well plates into suitable habitats for both Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti, as they provided a compact living space for individual mosquitoes and improved safety over cartons. To detect chikungunya virus from experimentally infected mosquitoes, quantitative reverse-transcription real-time PCR, normalized to a standard curve, was performed on RNA purified from mosquito saliva samples. This collection technique is a promising method for assaying arbovirus transmission rates over time from experimentally infected mosquitoes as it facilitates rapid longitudinal collection of infected saliva from individual mosquitoes. Also, by eliminating the need for glass capillaries and reducing manipulation of mosquitoes, this technique improves biosafety, saves time and allows for increased numbers of mosquitoes per experiment.",23.982739430960894,8.489793184204805

Nevertheless, the methods employed had the limitation of not being fully parametric, meaning they could not be extended to fit arbitrary transmission models to the observed data. Keeling et al.

Few developing countries have systems in place to respond to case-reporting of zoonotic diseases through implementation of disease control measures. The chronic lack of response (or capacity to respond) [40] is disempowering and de-motivating at the grassroots level for healthcare and veterinary workers alike. This problem is further compounded by the potential negative consequences of making a report. Collecting diagnostic samples (e.g. wildlife post-mortem sampling) not only involves time and effort, but can also be unpleasant, arduous and sometimes hazardous. Animal owners and health workers may be unwilling to report illness and initiate a process of investigation that may have severe social and economic implications for both themselves and their neighbours, for example, through trade and movement restrictions or the destruction of animals [2, 7] . The absence of direct benefits, combined with the costs of making a report, make it understandable that individuals often choose not to report outbreaks. Addressing these issues remains a high priority.

Here, through metatranscriptomic surveys, we reveal several previously unknown viruses that were discovered in dead and dying aquaculture fish, and show them to also occur in wild and hatchery-reared fish. Depending on the viral and host species, the viruses range from being localised to widespread, from infecting <1% to >20% of fish, and being from within the limits of detection to very high loads. Our results are consistent with some of these viruses being causative agents of disease, making it critical to understand their possible roles in salmon mortality and the decline of wild salmon populations, and their potential interactions with net-pen fish farming and hatchery rearing. Viral discovery in moribund individuals followed by extensive surveillance and histopathological localisation are powerful tools towards the ultimate goals of identifying causative agents of disease and understanding the impact of infectious agents in wild populations.

General syndromic surveillance projects in Papua New Guinea [22] , Cambodia [2] , and Madagascar [23] have produced moderate improvements in the completeness and timeliness of reporting, e.g. an increase in completeness from 40% prior to 70% during the pilot in Papua New Guinea. Targeted surveillance programs for malaria [24] , rabies [3] , and influenza in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya [7] , respectively, produced considerable improvements in report timeliness, eg. a reduction in the median reporting delay for influenza in Kenya from 21 to 7 days. Mobile The proportion of transmission initiated = Total reports partially or fully received × 100 / total N reports expected from sub-districts) b The proportion of transmission complete = Total reports fully received × 100 / total N reports expected from sub-districts) c As the surveillance focal points were absent from their health facilities for the booster-training workshop in Berberati during epidemiological week 14, they did not submit their Weekly Reports until returning the following week. Therefore completeness, but not timeliness of reports, was calculated for week 14 technology appears also to have enhanced surveillance in emergency settings, such as following the earthquakes in Sichuan, China [10] and Haiti [11] . However, larger, comprehensive mobile phone-based surveillance systems have not been assessed in post-conflict settings with ongoing insecurity. This project assesses the impact, feasibility, and cost of using mobile technology for the surveillance of a broad range of notifiable conditions using a simple SMS-based application in a post-conflict setting. Our study shows that, within weeks, the completeness and timeliness of weekly surveillance reports can be considerably improved, and the improvement maintained, despite the remoteness of the healthcare centers and primitive road conditions. Although sub-districts were highly compliant in submitting weekly reports on their mobile devices, the proportion whose transmissions were successfully completed differed significantly ( Table 2) . Of the two distant sub-districts with the medium-level security risk (Gadzi and Amada-Gaza), one managed a high level of completeness (Gadzi 73.3%) relative to the other (Amada-Gaza 43%). Conversely, two sub-districts in areas of low security risk near the capital (Sosso-Nakombo, Dede-Makouba) managed only 66.7% and 56.7% levels of completeness, respectively. The consistently high level of submission of weekly reports from all sub-districts suggests that remoteness and level of insecurity did not constrain the use of the technology in the health centers. Rather, we suspect that the differences seen between sub-districts in report completeness and timeliness may relate more to the quality of the communications network, the aptitude of the participating staff and, in several settings, the need for motorcycle taxi transport to a nearby community to access a telecommunications network. The electronic reporting system in the present project was rated as highly usable by participating staff. This may reflect a readiness of the staff to adopt new technology for digital surveillance, however we do not have baseline information with which to measure changes in perceptions or technical skills. The cost of the pilot was higher than mobile disease surveillance interventions reported in other contexts [6] . This is due to the necessary use of smartphones, the provision of these devices to all health facilities, the purchase of 'fleet' services from multiple cellular network providers, the costs of SMS transmission, the adherence to the 'zero reporting' protocol on a relatively large number of diseases (N = 20), and the need for considerable IT consultant services in the developmental stage. The projection of local operating costs beyond the pilot stage, US$17.20 per health facility per week, includes communication fees, but does not estimate the cost of ongoing technical support and staff training. Although still high, this cost is more comparable to that reported elsewhere [2, 3, 7, [22] [23] [24] .",22.34344159483068,7.4403172842830765

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.",24.02605645488173,10.065276391512796

For instance, individuals who are aware of the on-going transmission of influenza are likely to search for information for prevention and self-diagnosis purposes, and may tend to seek medical attention once feeling sick. Thus, although it has not been recognized and studied systemically, many influenza surveillance systems may reflect changes in the information environment as well as actual disease trends. And although the data we analysed are all from Hong Kong, the underlying mechanisms are not specific to that region, so the problem may be widespread. Indeed, Zhang and colleagues and Stoto found similar patterns using less formal methods in the United States [6, 7] . Some surveillance systems seem to represent public awareness more than actual disease status. In particular, ad hoc surveillance systems set up during the early ascertainment of pH1N1 outbreaksuch as the walk-in clinics for ILI, making pH1N1 as a new condition for notifiable infectious diseaseare more correlated with the information environment than other surveillance systems that we identified in Hong Kong.

In general, narrowing the objectives of a microarray study can provide insight into which biological samples should be compared. Clear and concise goals also help define the scope of the study, providing a framework within which subsequent experiments can be proposed and implemented.

In this study, we kept the threshold for reporting minor variants relatively high to avoid calling sequencing errors or PCR artifacts as legitimate variants, so the data represent only a subset of the potential number of variants present. The data describe a larger, more diverse group of MERS-CoV variants or quasispecies present in camels than has been described in humans. This difference suggests that within that diverse repertoire in camels, there may be only a subset of viruses capable of being transmitted and replicating in humans. Understanding and detecting these variants will be critical in describing how MERS-CoV is transmitted both zoonotically and person to person. Indeed, this has been supported by the limited sequencing of camel MERS-CoV available and is now greatly expanded by our current study. The large population of MERS-CoV quasispecies within camels, coupled with the known circulation of other coronaviruses in camels and the recombination potential between coronaviruses could lead to highly divergent and novel coronaviruses. 20,21,28-30 A One Health approach was the underlying principle on which this study was designed. It was known that a German citizen visited a livestock market that houses dromedaries and following that visit, was MERS-CoV-positive. 41 Sampling and testing of camels at the market revealed a large diversity of MERS-CoVs circulating among camels. The genetic diversity of MERS-CoVs and the frequency of recombination suggest the potential for emergence of new MERS-CoV variants, which may be able to sustain more efficient person-to-person transmission, as with severe acute respiratory syndrom.

The results showed that viral numbers quantified by real-time PCR assay were significantly different using specific primers targeted to gRNAs and different sgmRNAs. Thus, specific probes and oligos in UNDP-PCR assay for PEDV were designed based on ORF1a region, which could truly reflect the level of viral infection. To ensure wide detection range of this UNDP-PCR assay for PEDV, 16 highly conserved sequences in ORF1a region from all PEDV strains published on National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) were selected to design PEDV specific primers used in UNDP-PCR.",24.268125808784628,8.621812903177979

The assay turned out to be rapid and straightforward to perform. Compared to routine testing, hands-on time of the RP panel was very low (Ͻ2 min), whereas the hands-on time of the routine testing was about 30 to 45 min, depending on the nature and number of samples tested. The overall run time of the platforms was also in favor of the ePlex system, as it takes approximately 90 min for nucleic acid extraction, amplification, hybridization, and detection, whereas routine testing takes up to 2 h and 45 min using different systems and multiple real-time PCR assays in multiplex. An important advantage of the ePlex system is the possibility of random access testing, compared to batch-wise testing in the current diagnostic real-time PCR approach. With a relatively short turnaround time and the potential to randomly load and run up to 24 specimens, the ePlex system is very suitable for testing STAT samples, which require immediate testing. In contrast to LDTs, where C T values represent a quantitative indicator, the ePlex system generates qualitative results only. The C T value is dependent on many different factors such as sample type and course of infection and can therefore differ greatly, even within a single patient. Hence, a qualitative result, e.g., identification of the pathogen, is the major factor for patient management. The costs of reagents per sample are relatively high for ePlex compared to LDT. However, when taking into account the hands-on time of technicians and the clinical benefit of more rapid results, the assay will most likely be more cost-effective. Studies evaluating a rapid diagnostic assay for respiratory pathogens, such as the FilmArray respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT), have already shown the impact of rapid diagnostics for respiratory pathogens, since it decreased the duration of antibiotic use, the length of hospitalization, and the time of isolation, delivering financial savings (13, 14) .

Although discrepancies are expected in any pandemic planning nationally or internationally due to the uncertainty associated with pandemics, it is important to have a consistent basis for planning, especially if it is to be applied at both local and national levels. While Malawi developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance and updated overall goals in PRPI, most response actions addressing the 2009 pandemic failed to achieve the important public health goals that the plans set out. We found that the national pandemic plan was not updated regularly and experts in influenza emergency management were rarely consulted. A number of gaps in national action were also identified, including poor coordination between national policymakers with local stakeholders, weak leadership in the influenza working committee and lack of surveillance structures such as IACs and diagnostic laboratories. There is need for coordination between the private and public sectors in order to continue providing essential services such as water, energy and safe transport. Cooperation on influenza activities would reinforce the implementation of PRPI, but this would require that responsibilities and actions are defined phase by phase. Influenza research focusing on the national and local context is important to manage challenges and problems that might be experienced during the influenza outbreak. In addition, there is need for political interventions to improve pharmaceutical logistics which in turn would improve the availability of vaccines and other drugs, enabling people to be vaccinated on time during seasonal and pandemic periods. However, there is also a need to ensure that the public is aware that influenza is a reportable disease. Most importantly, there is a need to upgrade laboratory networks and diagnostic capacity, to include active sentinel surveillance through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) and other operational structures like FluNet. In general, PRPI operations can be strengthened through effective IEC activities such as communicating real time surveillance data or communicating the nature, spread, peak and decline of influenza (both seasonally and during pandemics) to the general public. This can be done by electronic means, phones and meetings. The regular dissemination of such information may change public attitudes and perceptions about influenza.",24.292163316843173,9.439974269323587

By improving the understanding of mechanisms of disease transmission, finer tuning within the spectrum of intervention strategies becomes possible [15, 16] .

For example, the Critical Response Time (CRT or time available to implement effective epidemic control measures) should be considered in decision-making [1, 5] . That is so because for any intervention to be very effective (≈ 100%), it must be deployed under a realist timeframe; if it requires a longer period of time, it will necessarily be (i) less effective (if not ineffective), and (ii) more expensive [5] . CRT may or may not include geo-referenced data. When it lacks geographical data, it becomes much shorter, making useless almost any intervention. Thus, the real significance of CRT is that it should be expanded (giving decision-makers more time to complete interventions) − which can only be achieved when high-resolution geo-referenced epidemiologic data are analyzed in time and space. Thus, to achieve improved epidemic control measures, geographically explicit data should be collected from epidemics, analysed and lessons learnt made available for future interventions. Only such (local or regional) data can support scientifically valid decision-making. Yet, even recent epidemics have been addressed with ad hoc policies, such as the classic '3-km radius control rings' -which assume all epidemics (ie, all pathogens, all host species, and all local geographies) are identical [1] [2] [3] .

Significance values are assigned to the correlation scores by comparing them against an empirical distribution derived from over 1,000 array experiments. To handle samples that may contain a mixture of organisms, there is an iterative version of E-Predict, which, after identifying the most likely target on an array, sets the intensities of the probes matching the target to zero, computes new correlation coefficients, and repeats the identification process. Since it requires a corpus of data from previous experiments with the same array design, E-Predict cannot be applied to new, prototype array designs.

Emerging pathogens are distinguished from the next stage, novel potential pathogens, in that there is clear evidence that they can cause disease in humans. Relative to emerging infectious diseases, however, emerging pathogens (in their present state) do not cause significant levels of morbidity or mortality. This is not to imply that they do not have the potential to become an emerging infectious disease; some will and some may never. In many cases emerging pathogens will have been identified as infectious in a single or small number of local cases. Examples of emerging pathogens include many multi-drug resistant microbes. For these pathogens, the potential health impact will vary with the availability and accessibility of treatment options. Another example of an emerging pathogen is Jamestown Canyon virus. Jamestown Canyon virus is a member of the California serogroup of bunyaviruses spread by mosquitoes from the typical cervid reservoir. Though this pathogen was originally discovered in the 1960s in mosquitoes, only 15 human cases have been reported in the United States since 2004 [28] . The Jamestown Canyon virus is rare, yet endemic in parts of the United States and Canada.

Currently, a fourth large-scale outbreak is occurring and spreading out from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, to neighboring provinces and other countries. There is a dearth of epidemiological data about the emerging coronavirus, which would be of crucial importance to design and implement timely, ad hoc effective public health interventions, such as contact tracing, quarantine and travel restrictions. In this study, we adopted a deterministic model to shed light on the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus and assess the impact of public health interventions on infection. We found that the basic reproduction number could be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23), which seems consistent with the special period prior to the Spring Festival when contacts were higher than usual, and with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least three-four generations. It is worth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29 January 2020, as shown in Table 4 . Particularly, the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29 January 2020, which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711. Furthermore, according to our model, the outbreak, under the most restrictive measures, is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020), with a significant low peak value. Our investigation has major practical implications for public health decision-and policy-makers.

These include: missing information from populations who do not access health care or do so through informal channels; unsuitability to detect new, potentially high-impact outbreaks (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome); and delays in reporting due to difficulties in obtaining specimens for testing or due to delayed laboratory confirmation.",23.490055697802823,8.752023104938807

In the future, it would be desirable to develop an M. pneumoniae diagnosis kit that can diagnose pathogens from nasal or pharyngeal swabs at outpatient clinics or the bedside of patients. In Japan, two official pathogen surveillance methods have been conducted under the infection control laws: sentinel pathogen surveillance and active surveillance. The official pathogenic surveillance has been conducted at sentinel medical institutions regardless of outbreaks. On the other hand, in patients with serious diseases, active pathogenic surveillance has sometimes been conducted on the basis of notifications by medical institutions. However, active surveillance is conducted only when an infection spreads widely enough to cause serious problems in a particular region and the surveillance of pathogens may not be timely enough to mount a response to control outbreaks. Pathogenic surveillance for all patients with signs of an infection would detect agents of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases; however, the cost would be prohibitive. Therefore, system coordination to perform pathogen surveillance based on early detection of outbreaks is necessary. The scheme proposed by the present study uses PCR testing triggered by detection alerts from syndromic surveillance systems. In general, syndromic surveillance offers earlier detection of infectious diseases than traditional surveillance. Moreover, if the pathogen remains unknown following bedside testing using several rapid tests or other typical examinations, the proposed scheme requires the collection of specimens as soon as possible and sending them to a laboratory for definitive diagnoses. However, it takes a few days to transfer the specimens and a few extra days for the information of the identified pathogen to be shared among medical facilities, public health centers, and local governments in the involved areas. In the proposed scheme, we can use pathogenic information to control ongoing outbreaks and, hopefully, decrease the number of potential infections.",23.06668912106455,8.42785612798527

A broad restructuring of the poultry distribution system would greatly help to reduce environmental contamination and thus risk of transmission in both poultry and humans. Key changes would include a shift from rLBMs to cold-chain distribution, and introduction of a centralized slaughter system with standardized, hygienic practices for slaughter, decontamination, and waste processing. These changes are more difficult to implement in some countries because of the cultural and social importance of rLBMs as well as the ever-changing animal-trade network which involves many small businesses. Nevertheless, policies that require standardized poultry supply activities, with minimal stay-times of birds in any specific holding and minimal transfers between holdings before entering rLBMs are essential to control the transmission of AIVs in poultry populations, and thus prevent the emergence of novel strains. Systematic sampling and testing in a geographically representative sample of large Chinese wLBMs should be undertaken urgently. Both the 2009 emergence of human H1N1 in the North American pork supply chain and the 2013 H7N9 outbreak of H7N9 in the Chinese poultry supply chain motivate a transition from ad hoc academic studies to systematic representative surveillance of influenza A viruses in key livestock populations.",23.29524538042341,7.945348689943731

We assume exponential distribution for all parameters of model M related to the length of the different periods (e.g. latency, infectiousness, etc.), though it would be preferable to use multiple classes within each group to give more realistic gamma distributed lifetimes (see for instance [56] ). We assume density-dependent growth only in eggs, though other density-dependent regulating processes should be considered for other lifestages of the mosquitoes, e.g. larvae and pupae [25] . These modeling choices are due to the lack of data for parametrizing the model. The lack of information on the actual number of breeding sites -it could be assessed only by performing a field study -prevent us to give precise estimates on the density of mosquitoes over time in the study area. However, we would note that our estimates of R 0 , attack rates and probability of major outbreak are robust with respect to assumptions on the number of breeding sites. Moreover, the temporal dynamics of the vector is qualitatively well captured by model M (though not in terms of absolute abundance) and this allowed us to clarify whether or not the sharp decrease in the number of cases observed after the intervention was due to the intervention itself or to the spontaneous reduction of adults due to decrease of temperature. Definitely, a key lesson learnt from the analysis of the Chikungunya outbreak in Italy is the necessity to improve tools for obtaining reliable, though costly, estimates of the vector density (see for instance [57] ) -thus bypassing the necessity of developing ad-hoc models.

One large problem, obvious during the 2009 pandemic, was the dearth of surveillance systems geared towards secondary care. Whilst many countries could track syndromic respiratory illness in primary care settings quite effectively (and some coupled this to virological surveillance), at the start of the pandemic, few had systems capable of doing much more than counting the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory illness. Ad hoc systems were devised in haste, but detailed clinical and epidemiological information on severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) was initially hard to locate. In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic it has been recognised that SARI surveillance systems are critically important but mainly underdeveloped; and that their usefulness will extend over a broad range of acute respiratory pathogens, known and unknown.

Simply stated, the goal of mass critical care is to provide a few key interventions (those with the highest impact and potential to save lives) to many people rather then providing very resource intense interventions to a few [40, 46, 47] . All processes and procedures are open to modification and must be considered from a new perspective including standards of care, staffing, equipment, and the allocation of resources. Although there certainly is a need to modify the standard of care during a pandemic, one must always keep in mind the primary objective of ensuring that the maximum number of people possible, survive. Thus, caution must be exercised when expanding clinical roles or modifying management to ensure that care is not compromised beyond the point where more harm is being done than good. For instance, it is of little use to move to a ventilation strategy such as long term manual ventilation with bag-valve-masks that may allow many more people to be ventilated but results in an increased number of deaths due to barotrauma than would have occurred if fewer patients were ventilated using a less harmful ventilation strategy. Striking an appropriate balance requires monitoring treatment outcomes during the response. In order to comply with medicolegal and ethical standards, plans to alter the standard of care during a pandemic should be publicly discussed and documented in advance with clear, objective criteria defined for the institution of mass critical care [44] .

The carcass was collected by the Department of Veterinary Services for necropsy and samples of brain tissue were sent to the National Veterinary Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture in Gaborone, Botswana. On 11 December a partial test report was obtained with the results that a direct fluorescent antibody test (FAT) performed on a sample of brain tissue preserved in 50% glycerol indicated a positive result for the rabies antigen, which provided a definitive diagnosis of infection. No further information was provided subsequent to this initial laboratory report. Further brain samples were collected from two other wild dog carcasses, the second sample was collected on 5 December 2014 from a two and a half year old male and the third sample was collected from a six month old female on 6 December 2014, although this carcass was in an advanced state of decomposition and autolysis of tissues would likely have diminished the diagnostic quality of the samples.

Reporting influenza-like-illness (ILI) through direct reporting by healthcare providers or through healthcare system reporting can indicate surges in possible cases as well as identify circulating strains. This information can be used to rapidly deploy pharmaceutical interventions and implement social distancing actions. Healthcare providers can report ILI through the U.S. Influenza Sentinel Provider Surveillance Network where the total number of ILI is reported and a number of patient samples are tested for influenza virus for genetic typing. Syndromic surveillance systems such as Biosense and ESSENCE can indicate emergency department utilization for ILI and assist monitoring for impact. Viral surveillance can also indicate the incidence of antiviral resistance. The WHO collects influenza surveillance data and provides global information through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (Fig. 16-9 ).,26.277226009646764,8.734236940779189

However, most studies did not include respiratory viruses beyond RSV and the majority did not report beyond the first few months of life. The proportion of RVIs in our inpatient predischarge setting of 1.7% was much lower than the 4%-52% incidence reported in other NICU studies [6, 15, 22] . The higher incidence in previous studies is likely due to the differences in study design, where these studies performed periodic surveillance testing for RVI. Our study included only symptomatic infants with an RVI during their admission. This approach may have missed infants with mild symptoms or who were asymptomatic. Furthermore, differences in testing methodology such as primary usage of multiplex PCR may account for the differences in incidence. Our lower RVI rate could also possibly be attributable to the strict enforcement of infection control policies in our department, which are similar to those in published infection prevention guidelines [17, 23] . Even so, guidelines specific to the neonatal setting is lacking and the effectiveness of most interventions has not been systematically studied. Differences in testing strategy and laboratory methodology also likely accounted for the lack of viral codetection in our study, which has been reported in other pediatric studies [4, 6, 24] .

The presence of unusual E 1 B proteins of Ad 40 associated with viral or cellular factors might explain the inhibition of d11520 DNA synthesis in coinfection experiments. Our PCR results show that at least one mRNA is synthesized in a region corresponding to the 55 k messenger of nonfastidious adenoviruses.

Such technology could also be applied to targeted surveillance of high-risk populations for colonization with MDROs (e.g., patients awaiting admission to the ICU or transferred from another healthcare facility or a nursing home). In hospitals with a high prevalence of MDROs, the ED could play a role in active surveillance, although the costs, benefits, and implications of ED-based surveillance have yet to be studied.

The impact of coinfection with multiple organisms is also poorly understood, especially with regard to which organism to target with specific antibiotic treatment. Current clinically available microbiologic techniques do not provide a full understanding of the microbiologic diversity within the lungs of bronchiectasis patients. We may learn more from ongoing research into the lung microbiome as well as the impact of antimicrobial therapies on the balance of organisms within that microbiome. At the present time, it is imperative for clinicians to carefully monitor the microbiologic results of patients with bronchiectasis in order to provide optimal and judicious antibiotic treatments as well as to help with assessing the prognosis of the individual patient. The frequency of monitoring for each type of pathogen (routine bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal) has not been clearly spelled out in existing guidelines. How sputum samples are handled (collection and processing) also varies from region to region and from laboratory to laboratory. In patients with established bronchiectasis, careful microbiologic surveillance in the stable and exacerbated states is needed. Clinicians need to be aware of local microbiologic data and need to track the results in individual patients. Close interaction with the local microbiology laboratory may also improve antibiotic stewardship for patients with bronchiectasis. Clinicians should strongly consider establishing a protocol for obtaining sputum cultures at regular intervals in their bronchiectasis patients based upon local infection patterns and overall experience with their patients. It is clear that routine bacterial and mycobacterial surveillance is needed; routine fungal cultures may or may not be of value and viral cultures are probably most worthwhile at times of exacerbation.

However, it is essential to emphasize that, in practice, no diagnostic test is 100% sensitive or 100% specific, so there is always a chance of obtaining a false-negative or false-positive test result. Therefore, confirmation of unexpected or unusual test results should always precede their use in making major colony management decisions. The best way to investigate unexpected or unusual results is to gather enough additional information to substantiate or refute the initial finding. Options for confirmatory testing include repeating the same test or doing a suitable alternative test on the same sample or a new sample derived from the same animal, or conducting the same or different tests on samples collected from cohort animals. In practice, all of these approaches are often necessary. For example, if a serum sample tests positive for an agent by ELISA, one should attempt to confirm the result by retesting the sample using an alternative serological assay, such as an IFA test. Testing additional animals from the colony by serology for the same agent is also prudent. In addition, if a suitable alternative test such as PCR, culture, or histopathology exists for the pathogen, it is wise to test animals from the same colony using these techniques. However, suitable alternative testing methods are not available for all pathogens. Readers should recall that when multiple diagnostic approaches are used to test for the same agent, it is possible to obtain conflicting results. This is most common when using PCR assays or histopathology as confirmatory tests for serologically detected agents that cause acute infections. It is essential to remember that serology provides an indirect measure of exposure to an agent, whereas PCR directly detects the presence of the agent and histopathology detects pathological changes induced by the microbe. Therefore, it is quite possible for an animal to have been exposed to an agent, to have developed a detectable antibody response, and to test pos-itive serologically, but to have since cleared the infection and thus test negative for the agent by PCR or histopathology. Conversely, it is possible for an animal to be acutely infected with a pathogen, to lack a detectable antibody response, and to test negative for the agent by serology, but still test positive for the presence of the agent by PCR or show acute lesions suggestive of infection. Understanding the epizootiology of infectious agents within a given animal population and having knowledge of the advantages and limitations of each diagnostic methodology will help sort out these potential differences, and can help in deciding on appropriate methods and samples to use for confirmatory testing. In addition, experts at diagnostic laboratories can provide insight on test performance, help with data interpretation, and aid in developing a plan for health monitoring and follow-up testing.",24.670000179974252,9.857206965018118

These sites tolerated the insertion of only small linear ligand sequences without substantially affecting the infectivity and propagation of the resulting retargeted vector [57] . Insertion of complex, folded, and consequently more selective ligands, appeared to disturb trimerization of the Ad fiber and prevent subsequent incorporation of fiber into the adenovirus capsid [58] . To overcome this limitation, a fiber replacement strategy for the generation of tropism-modified Ad5 was considered. In this strategy, the fiber knob domain, alone or together with the shaft domain, was replaced with a combination of two heterologous domains, one of which functioned as a receptor-binding ligand and the other of which supported the functional structure of the entire protein chimera. We showed the feasibility of this approach by replacing the Ad5 fiber protein with a protein chimera comprising an N-terminal portion of the Ad5 fiber, genetically fused with the phage T4 Fibritin which contained a trimerization motif and thus facilitated the naturally trimerized structure of the Ad5 fiber (Fig. 4) [59] . Targeting of the resultant rAd5 vector to an artificial receptor was achieved by incorporation of C-terminal peptide ligands into the protein chimera. Subsequently, we used the same strategy to create rAd5 vectors retargeted to human CD40 by incorporating the functional TNF-like domain of hCD40L into a chimeric Ad fiber consisting of the Ad5 fiber capsid-anchoring N-terminus and trimerized phage T4 fibritin (Fig. 4C ) [60] . Despite the considerable size of the CD40L domain and its complex tertiary structure, both components of the targeting protein, the CD40L domain and the FF backbone, folded properly, thereby making the entire chimera fully functional. The incorporation of the chimeric fiber into the Ad virion did not affect the functional structure of its CD40-binding component, resulting in a vector (Ad5.FFCD40L) that used CD40 as a surrogate receptor for cell entry. However, in comparing the CD40-targeted Ad with untargeted Ad containing wild-type (wt) fibers, the CD40-targeted Ad showed significantly reduced transduction efficiency of target cells expressing both CAR and CD40 at high levels [60] . Experiments with radiolabeled CD40-targeted Ad and untargeted Ad nevertheless revealed that both viruses were equally efficient in binding to target cells. This result led us to hypothesize that complete deletion of the fiber in CD40-targeted Ad affected its ability to infect target cells by interfering with a downstream process from primary binding to the cell surface. The construction of a mosaic version of CD40-targeted Ad which, in addition to phage T4 fibritin, and the human CD40L chimeric fiber, also contained a full size wt Ad5 fiber engineered to lack CAR-binding ability (by deletion of the CAR-binding TAYT sequence), enhanced its ability to infect target cells and facilitated large scale production of a stably CD40-retargeted rAd5 vector (i.e. Ad5.FFCD40L[F5dTAYT]) [60] . Subsequent comparison of the CD40-targeted mosaic Ad with untargeted Ad5 showed the superior transduction efficacy of the mosaic vector on human MoDC in vitro [60] . To determine the potential of the Ad5.FFCD40L[F5dTAYT] vectors to effect in situ targeted antigen expression in DC, we constructed a CD40-targeted mosaic Ad encoding both GFP and the Carcino-Embryonic Antigen (CEA) [49] . The application of this vector in the stringent human skin explant model demonstrated its utility for in vivo selective transduction of DC and induction of their activation and migration [49] .",21.668000689214868,8.313191435918947

First, the flight datasets used in model building only record passenger information on direct links between airports. Although the model is capable of estimating the flows between airports separated by 2 or more stops, the estimates could be biased to a certain degree. To address this issue, additional datasets with passenger transfer information, such as flight ticket databases, could be further included in the model. Second, a simple 200 km catchment area was set to estimate the population size served by an airport. The realistic travel time/distance to an airport could vary by airport size, local economic size, population density, travel means, etc. More sophistication should be introduced to delineate the catchment area and better reflect the population sizes at the origin and destination airports. Third, the number of air passengers was assumed to be independent with one another between flight routes to satisfy the assumption of linear regression models. This route independence could be problematic, because the passenger numbers could be related when one route is connected to the other. In future research, the Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B) data, which records itinerary samples, can be further included in our model to account for multiple-stop travels and dependence between flights. At last, the selection of months as the basic temporal unit for modeling is an ad hoc criterion that may impose new problems. For instance, the air traffic often peaks during long holiday periods and school breaks that may cross months. Such fine-grained peaks might be evened in the monthly model and maps.",24.723060086272543,9.78900833051983

As a result, influenza cases and the disease burden associated with influenza are underestimated in many countries. • A lag time often exists between data collection and influenza testing, or influenza testing and sharing of the test results for public reporting, as well as sharing influenza virus specimens for vaccine strain selection.

However, when using such a device for disinfection purpose in daily life, one has to keep in mind that 20 sec UV-C light exposition time was necessary in order to properly disinfect a rather small surface area from enterococci.

Relatively straightforward experiments could test the functional status of APCs in infected animals through intracellular or extracellular staining for EBOV gene products and cellular factors (e.g. cytokines). Ideally, such experiments would quantify the frequency of infection of different APC types and the cytokines secreted by different cells types. Isolation of in vivo infected APCs and testing their ability to process antigen and stimulate an EBOV antigen-specific response ex vivo would provide a more clear understanding their functional status and allow comparison to studies performed in cells infected in vitro. Given the copious production of cytokines, chemokines and possibly viral products, it is possible that APCs and other immune cells that are not directly infected will exhibit altered function. Therefore, it will also be important to assess the functional status of uninfected APCs and lymphocytes from the same infected animals. For example, it might prove fruitful to assess the ability of T cells to respond to either allo-or superantigens from competent non-infected MHC-compatible or incompatible APCs. Such studies would not only inform our understanding of APCs but also better describe the status of the adaptive immune response. This is particularly important in NHPs, which most closely mimic severe human infections. Functional T cells have been shown to be present in EBOV-infected mice (Bradfute et al., 2008) . Hopefully, by more precisely defining filovirus-APC interactions from the molecular perspective and the contribution of these interactions to pathogenesis in vivo, new specific and precisely targeted therapeutic interventions can be designed.",23.47060563820498,8.50582389647403

PCR is performed using primers that flank the microsatellite repeat region (and also include unique genomic sequences). The microsatellite units are repeated a variable number of times at a given chromosomal locus. Many of these microsatellites are highly polymorphic with respect to the number of repeats at a given allele and are also highly heterozygotic within the population. Analysis of the number of repeats and the extent of population heterozygosity allows calculation of the probability of matched microsatellite amplicons from different individuals. Typically, a minimum of four and up to 12 microsatellite loci are screened in PCR identity tests. For example, the GammaSTR ® Quadriplex assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) amplifies four microsatellite-containing loci ( Figure 9 ); the probability that two Caucasian individuals will have matching amplicons at all four loci is 1 in 16,790. (If an additional eight loci are added, the matching probability is 1 in 3.03 × 10 11 .) In pathology practice, microsatellite PCR is useful in resolving issues of questionable specimen identity (Figure 9 ).

The incubation period of the strain that he used was most frequently two to three days.

However, local beliefs are relevant in understanding the population health and in drawing behavioural interventions. Sometimes, such beliefs are misconceptions, which need to be addressed. Specifically, disease causation is often divided into four types: natural, supernatural, mystical, and hereditary/genetic.",22.50184927177249,8.586306783329809

These infections have many genomic copies detectable by methodology geared to small volumes of blood or plasma. In contrast, Lyme disease has very low microbe numbers in the majority of clinical samples. With enhancement and enrichment methods, detection of B. burgdorferi in the blood is increasingly possible. Multiple displacement amplification [26] and similar strategies in which DNA is exponentially amplified by isothermal amplification increases the yield of B. burgdorferi by at least 200 times above normal [27] . This makes a PCR detection assay far more sensitive. In other studies, the sensitivity of PCR-based assays was increased, on the order of 16 000-fold, by combining 3 consecutive methods [27] . Similar to the approach used for blood cultures for sepsis where multiple large volumes of blood are taken, the first step was to start with a larger volume of whole blood, 1.25 mL (more than 0.5 mL of plasma or serum are often requested by clinical laboratories). The second step was to increase the relative content of B. burgdorferi compared to human or other microbial DNA by using targeted isothermal amplification. In vitro experiments resulted in a 200-to 2000-fold increase in the targeted DNA. In a set of clinical EM samples, the number of cases detected was 7-fold greater than without this step. The third step that increased sensitivity with 100% specificity was the use of multiple primers. It should be noted that there appear to be skin-restricted genotypes, which may be the reason for negative results in blood. We should also consider enrichment or concentration of a pathogen to increase the target concentration for nucleic acid extraction followed by PCR analysis.",21.963155834804834,8.251781052724322

As such, the work on disaster incubation has not yet crystallized into a set of propositions in such a way as to define a formal theory. Although it is perhaps true that the study of disaster incubation has not yet achieved paradigmatic status, we contend that there now exists sufficient theoretical and empirical development in this area to define a coherent approach which for the purposes of this article we will refer to as Disaster Incubation Analysis (DIA). Largely informed through research in organizational sociology, DIA has tended to focus on the organizational foundation of disasters. In this vein, Turner's pioneering work in the area has been based on the analysis of the inquiry proceedings that followed three high-profile disasters in the United Kingdom. Notably, his analyses examined how regulatory agencies and firms were implicated in the disaster incubation process. In this connection, Turner identified several important underlying organizational factors, including: rigidities in institutional beliefs; the presence of distracting decoy phenomena; the neglect of outside complaints; multiple information-handling difficulties; the exacerbation of the hazards by strangers; the failure to comply with regulations; and the psychological tendency to minimize emergent danger. More recent efforts have built on the work of Turner, both by expanding his focus on the organizational foundation of disasters (see for example : Clarke, 1998 : Clarke, , 1993 Kroll-Smith, 1985, 1991; Dynes, 1993; Erikson, 1991; Freudenburg, 2001 Freudenburg, , 1997 Freudenburg and Gramling, 1994) as well as through expansion of the analytical scope of DIA to now consider the role of biophysical and environmental factors alongside the social factors emphasized by Turner (Ali, 2003; Klinenberg, 1999; Murphy, 2001) . It is perhaps this focus on both the biophysical and the socio-organizational factors that holds the most promise for the formal impact assessment and management of natural resource use, such as in the case of ground and surface water impacts we will discuss shortly. In this light, a critical feature of adopting DIA for environmental assessment is to address the latency dimension of the problem incubation; in particular, the question as to why the conditions that fostered a particular disaster went unnoticed. As much of the research in DIA has been based on post-hoc analyses, the challenge for the environmental assessor is to bring together the relevant insights from these retrospective case studies in order to apply them in a prospective manner to future scenarios in the planning process. This leads to a second point. As foresight is an essential foundation for effective planning, the need to identify the reasons for the failure of foresight is critical and DIA facilitates this identification by focusing explicit attention on these very reasons. Third, DIA is especially well-designed to address those situations in which largely overlooked cumulative impacts are critical. This is the case for example in relation to such processes as: those related to development pressures (such as incrementally increasing urban sprawl), globalized economic activities (such as intensification of livestock operations (i.e. ""factory farms)"", as well as creeping ""natural"" disasters such as desertification, global climate change, and the pathogenic contamination of groundwater, all of which may develop gradually over time in an unnoticed manner until the catastrophic impacts can no longer be ignored. Let us now consider empirically how such latent biophysical and social processes have environmental impacts and how they can be analyzed using DIA by considering the following two cases involving rural ground water and water use within the context of Toronto and its ex-urban and rural regions.",23.18573467736823,8.173835680205464

[7] [8] [9] However, ""in-house"" molecular methods require expensive laboratory equipment and carefully trained personnel. Despite its lower sensitivity compared to RT-PCR, the Biotrin hMPV EIA is a more rapid, less expensive and highly specific method for detection of hMPV in clinical samples that can be used in all microbiology laboratories. Importantly, the Biotrin hMPV EIA detected both major hMPV genotypes (A and B) from patients of different ages. One limitation of our study is the use of frozen NPA samples since cycles of freeze and thaw may lead to antigen degradation and potentially affect antigen detection; thus, we may have underestimated the true sensitivity of the EIA test. On the other hand, the frozen samples provided us with an opportunity to test different hMPV genotypes collected over several years. Another caveat is the generation of equivocal results with the EIA test, which implies the need for re-testing the same specimen with an alternative method, such as RT-PCR, or taking another sample for EIA testing (which was not feasible in our study).

When the policy was promulgated in 2012, roles and responsibilities were not well defined by the USG in the document. It was assumed by many that the IBC would take the lead on the issues as they relate to DURC research because the committee has recognized knowledge of the research being conducted by investigators and because of its members' many years of experience evaluating research involving rDNA, performing risk assessments, and assigning bio-containment levels. Of particular significance, 2014 policy reassigns the burden back to the Principal Investigator to initially identify their project as DURC. Further, the institution is required to establish an Institutional Review Entity (IRE). The IRE can be a committee established to review dual use research, an extant committee such as an IBC with the addition of ad hoc members to meet the established requirements of the committee, or an externally administered committee to review dual use research [31] . The IRE must be set up for the sole purpose of conducting review of research for dual use potential. The IRE must meet several criteria including that the group must be composed of at least five members and empowered by the institution to ensure it can execute the relevant requirements of the Policy for DURC Oversight. The members must have knowledge to assess the dual use potential of the range of relevant life science research conducted at a research facility. In addition, the committee must have individuals with knowledge of relevant US Government policies and understanding of risk assessment.

The IRE is responsible for communications with the US Government funding agencies regarding mitigation plans and will have ongoing oversight of the project [31] . Not surprisingly, the requirements for the IRE align with the established mandates for an IBC. In most circumstances and at the majority of establishments, the IBC is the logical choice for the review and oversight of DURC at the institutional level. However, putting the burden of DURC review on the IBC increases the workload and regulatory burden on an already overtaxed committee that is not compensated for their time and effort.

Both decreases in wait time and increases in the number of cases performed, as compared to the previous year, coincided with the addition of a third and 4th lab in our facility in April 1998 and May 2005, respectively. This trend was also seen (to a lesser extent) with the opening of catheterization laboratories in two regional hospitals, one 50 km (April 1999) and the other 70 km (February 2001) away from our centre. In addition to lab openings, capacity in our centre was potentially improved by four other, primarily systematic, means. First we have observed a change in the same-sitting (ad hoc) rate of PCI, increasing from 59% in 1997 to 90.7% in 2007. By performing the procedure ad hoc we diminished the need to have the patient come back to the lab, effectively eliminating the number of potential future cases, along with the time it takes to prepare the patient and set-up the lab for an additional procedure. Second, by staggering lab start times we were able to effectively extend our hours of service (as of January 2004). This allowed more flexibility for providing care for late day inpatient referrals and emergent cases. Finally, in May 2005 we instituted two changes. One was the opening of a 32-bed recovery and reception area exclusive to the catheterization laboratory. The recovery area provided more flexibility for managing care post-procedure. That is, patients were registered and accepted directly to the HIU independent of availability in our hospital inpatient wards. The other change was mandatory Pre-Cath Clinic attendance for all elective outpatients booked for a procedure at our centre. The clinic took place 3-5 days before the procedure. Capacity could improve because the Pre-Cath Clinic staff addressed potential medication and other issues that might otherwise cause a cancellation on the day of the procedure. In addition, the clinic provided education that would otherwise take up CATH laboratory staff time. Although each will logically improve ""realized"" capacity, many of the above-mentioned changes coincided with laboratory openings, thus it is difficult to ascertain the precise impact on our ability to deliver service (with regards to wait list management and caseload improvements) [9] .",34.34874501790391,12.617423820376645

On the other hand, such primers may not be elongated efficiently by DNA polymerase [1] . Although the importance of the 3 0 end triplet in primer design is recognized, many recommendations for 3 0 end triplet selection, based mostly on theory, have been put forth, and some contradict others. Recommended compositions of 3 0 ends are: no T at the 3 0 end and at least one W (A or T) in the 3 0 end triplets [3] ; S (C or G) at the 3 0 end and no GC or CG, due to potential formation of hairpins and primer-dimers [4] ; low GCC [2, 5] ; one or two S [6] .

WHO has limited access to the WTO meetings at which trade issues that could directly affect health are discussed. Thus, WHO has observer status in the committees on sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade, and ad-hoc observer status in the TRIPS and trade in services councils. Observer status allows WHO to contribute to discussions but not be officially involved in making decisions. Since 2000, there has been political deadlock over the issue of observer status, and several WTO bodies have granted this status ad hoc to international organisations, such as WHO, in the interim. Importantly, there are few trade issues deemed to directly affect health, and thus representation by WHO is restricted.

For these reasons, the role of NGS in clinical algorithms is still to be delineated. At this point in time, we suggest NGS is routinely applied for the diagnosis of acute cases of encephalitis for which no cause is found after targeted investigations using PCR. Recommendations for firstline targeted testing are discussed in detail elsewhere 14 but in the UK should include PCR for HSV, VZV and enteroviruses. However due to differing local epidemiology clinicians should consult the relevant national guidelines. 8, 13, 14, 16, 17 In immunocompromised patients however, metagenomics ought to be considered earlier; 73% of case reports in this review involved immunocompromised patients. This is the population at most risk of infection with novel and unexpected organisms and, moreover, may present with a more chronic or insidious clinical history 58 in which a one-week turn-aroundtime is more acceptable. Given that the causative pathogen is not always detected in CSF, in all cases of encephalitis in which diagnosis by NGS is being sought the preferred specimen type is brain biopsy. Nevertheless CSF samples are acceptable if it is the only specimen available. Our recommendations for the use of NGS in diagnosis of microbial causes of encephalitis are summarised in Fig. 5a , with the contrasting algorithm for targeted testing summarised in Fig. 5b . This review was limited to pathogen detection by NGS in brain biopsies or CSF. There may also be a role for testing other specimens, such as throat samples and urine. This was recently shown in an encephalitis case diagnosed by NGS of urine, identifying a case of Japanese encephalitis virus. 59 It is expected that over the next few years, the cost and time-to-result of metagenomics will reduce, and with this, it is foreseen that it will be possible to offer this as the first-line diagnostic test.

Data collection and analysis are also balkanized. 40 Unlike epidemiology, where there is some consensus over CSTE case definitions, different vendors and CERTs use different nomenclature to name malware and count its frequency. Consequently, ''comparing incident statistics across teams is difficult and often meaningless,'' which diminishes the value of what little information is shared. 31(p83) Proposals for the federal government to establish authoritative standards and agencies have gained little traction. In 1989, the General Accounting Office (GAO) argued that internet security required a focal point. It proposed that the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) establish this focal point, but to no avail. 30 In 1991, the National Research Council recommended that the government help establish a nongovernmental organization to serve a similar function-again, with no apparent impact. 41 CERT/CC even pitched a similar proposal in 1997, which, by implication, was a concession that the CERT/CC had failed to establish itself as the single clearinghouse for cyber intelligence. 42 In 1998, President Bill Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), 43 calling for ''A Public-Private Partnership'' to reduce the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber attack. PDD-63 encouraged the private sector to create an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), modeled on the CDC: As ultimately designed by private sector representatives, the ISAC may emulate particular aspects of such institutions as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that have proved highly effective. . 43 However, unlike the CDC (ie, a federal agency with police powers, informed by compulsory reporting at the state level), this ISAC was to be private and voluntary. Moreover, ''the single ISAC-the one PDD-63 calls for-was never built'' (interview with former US National Security Council staff, September 2015). Rather than establish a single clearinghouse, building separate ISACs became a business opportunity. 44 At least 19 sector-specific ISACs were subsequently established for financial services, energy, healthcare, and other parts of critical infrastructure. While reasonable, this outcome was not inevitable, especially since variation inside a given sector (eg, small and medium enterprises versus multinational corporations) may be just as significant for security as variation across sectors (eg, finance versus energy or healthcare).",22.812092389705427,9.181958398337093

Nowadays, it is quite a trend among researches to focus on improving the current diagnostic techniques rather than inventing a new method, hence, with further improvement of the procedures, more parasites can be detected simultaneously. The useful feature of mass screening and rapid diagnostic will improve the understanding of the parasites as well as to reduce transmission of disease (Yansouni et al. 2014) . Besides, the development of field-based diagnosis is also necessary to avoid critical delays. However, sensitivity and specificity as well as cost are still an issue.

Relatively straightforward experiments could test the functional status of APCs in infected animals through intracellular or extracellular staining for EBOV gene products and cellular factors (e.g. cytokines). Ideally, such experiments would quantify the frequency of infection of different APC types and the cytokines secreted by different cells types. Isolation of in vivo infected APCs and testing their ability to process antigen and stimulate an EBOV antigen-specific response ex vivo would provide a more clear understanding their functional status and allow comparison to studies performed in cells infected in vitro. Given the copious production of cytokines, chemokines and possibly viral products, it is possible that APCs and other immune cells that are not directly infected will exhibit altered function. Therefore, it will also be important to assess the functional status of uninfected APCs and lymphocytes from the same infected animals. For example, it might prove fruitful to assess the ability of T cells to respond to either allo-or superantigens from competent non-infected MHC-compatible or incompatible APCs. Such studies would not only inform our understanding of APCs but also better describe the status of the adaptive immune response. This is particularly important in NHPs, which most closely mimic severe human infections. Functional T cells have been shown to be present in EBOV-infected mice (Bradfute et al., 2008) . Hopefully, by more precisely defining filovirus-APC interactions from the molecular perspective and the contribution of theseinteractions to pathogenesis in vivo, new specific and precisely targeted therapeutic interventions can be designed.",23.581146206274568,8.544513095298386

This policy describes the requirements for local review, approval, and oversight of dual use research of concern (DURC). DURC is described in detail elsewhere in this book but, in short, DURC refers to research that produces valuable scientific information but may also be used in warfare or terror attacks. This federal policy requires that each institution designate an Institutional Review Entity (IRE) to review DURC projects and assist in creation of risk mitigation plans for these projects. The companion guide [14] that accompanies the federal policy suggests that IBCs are the most logical choice for the IRE since similar expertise is needed to assess the risks associated with recombinant DNA research and modifications of pathogens that may increase their transmissibility or pathogenicity. IBCs may not have the security expertise needed for these reviews, however, and consultants or ad hoc members may need to be added to fulfill the responsibilities assigned to the IRE. The DURC policy only applies to institutions that receive federal funding for life sciences research and is restricted to research involving 15 specific pathogens. Institutions or individuals that receive no federal funding are under no obligation to follow the DURC policy, nor are individuals who are working with pathogens other than the 15 specifically listed in the DURC policy. Many common human pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli, or influenza) are not on the list of pathogens covered by the DURC policy. Consequently, there is no regulatory reason why researchers cannot modify the pathogens to become more virulent.

Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) avoids such issues and remains the gold standard for antibody detection. 14 HI assays tend to be technically simple and rapid and do not require anti-species-specific secondary antibodies or highly purified antigen. Antibody measurements using HI have reasonable precision if attention is paid to minimizing interassay variation by titrating standard virus and antibody activity against each other and against the erythrocytes from multiple birds prior to testing. Even so, HI assays are still prone to an appreciable amount of intertest variations, especially if performed infrequently or without standard reference antigen and sera. 61 Along with HA and HI, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing has been used extensively for managing PBFD, 13 and in most countries, PCR testing has become the main method for detecting BFDV infection. As mentioned above, there is a wide variation in BFDV genetics, which has the potential to confound the PCR test design. Nevertheless, the BFDV Rep gene is relatively conserved, 1,62 and the PCR primer set P2-P4, 63 which targets this gene, has proven to be reliable for detecting BFDV DNA; even so, there are some rare genotypes that do not match perfectly with this primer set, and at least one study has revealed wide variations in diagnostic laboratory accuracy. 64 The PCR product from this diagnostic test covers a 700-nucleotide segment of the Rep gene, providing an ideal length for routine DNA sequencing, 65 which is useful for tracing the origin and establishment of infection in a flock. 66 This can be an important legal aspect of a diagnostic investigation. Within the diagnostic laboratory, it is also a useful step to monitor or identify potential sources of DNA contamination. Clinicians need to be aware that different laboratories might target slightly different parts of the BFDV genome or the capsid gene that has a higher degree of genetic diversity. Even for the same primer sequence set, they may use different PCR amplification conditions in their diagnostic assay, and the potential number of different variables that goes into designing a test protocol means that laboratory results from different laboratories should not be considered as equal.",26.333818744361494,10.475048417606981

The model allows a deep structural understanding of the potential pathways and molecular mechanisms that govern cross species transmission and pathogenesis. The biological impact of host shifting on antigenicity can be predicted using structural models of antibody-RBD interfaces, and then studied using a panel of well characterized human and mouse monoclonal antibodies targeting the different SARS-CoV RBD domains (Part 3). In parallel, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies can be used to select for escape mutations (Part 4), allowing for iterative rounds of prediction and testing on how these mutations impact host range and ACE2 recognition.",28.812678918605776,10.363262785725798

Many infections are identified at postmortem examination. 1 Histopathology can reveal lesions consistent with mycobacteriosis but cannot confirm nor identify the species in question. Confirmatory diagnostic methods include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture and sensitivity of feces and target tissues. It should be noted that intradermal tuberculosis testing, as used in humans, correlates poorly with the presence of disease in psittacines. 1 PCR testing of specimens is the most useful diagnostic test both for confirmation of infection and for speciation of the organism in question, which, again, is a critical consideration when considering treatment. Samples include feces and fresh tissue specimens. PCR can detect very low numbers of organisms and provide rapid results. Many diagnostic laboratories now offer PCR for mycobacterial organisms in exotic species (Table 2-9) .

Depending upon the location of the breeder, certain obstacles may need to be addressed relative to managing SPF production. Implementation of site-specific protocols addressing species-specific disease surveillance, preventative medicine, occupational health, and zoonoses training of employees are necessary. When breeding units are exposed to the outdoors, there may be concerns related to endemic parasitic diseases with specific intermediate hosts or vectors (Plasmodium sp., microfilaria, trematodes, cestodes) that are uncommon or not found within the USA. In this regard, foreign suppliers may have instituted both preventative programs and prophylactic treatment to block transmission of these parasites. Continued surveillance for these parasites upon arrival of these animals in the USA should still be practiced. The risk of animals' exposure to certain zoonotic disease may be related to a high prevalence of the disease within the colony's employees or their familial contacts. Such disease examples may include rubeola, Shigella sp., and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All nonhuman primate breeding programs must address occupational health and use of primary or personal protective equipment relative to human / nonhuman primate interactions. Macaque breeding colonies often have a goal of producing SPF animals (free of SRV, STLV-1, and B virus), but this goal may pose a diagnostic challenge due to the lack of local or in-house test systems with adequate sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, when PCR capability is needed, there may be obstacles in sending samples to a distant laboratory. This is a critical point when trying to maintain an SPF macaque colony or introduce new animals for expansion or as replacement breeders. Similarly, when investigating suspicious disease outbreaks, it may be difficult to find local laboratories capable of performing preferred diagnostics (e.g. direct PCR or culture for Mycobacterium).

This strategy is founded on the hypothesis that proteins which crystallize readily, even under suboptimal conditions, will do so again during focused crystallization attempts. In tier 1, the goal is to identify those targets which have a propensity to crystallize under the conditions tested; the quality of the crystals produced is not significantly important. To maximize throughput, the protein samples are purified with only one round of affinity purification and screened for crystal formation against a limited number of crystallization conditions; it is expected that some of the proteins will not be sufficiently pure or in the optimal state to crystallize.

In this stage, the targets that crystallized in tier 1 are reprocessed to contain SeMet, purified extensively and screened against an expanded set of crystallization conditions.

Thus, gene therapy is a tool of interest to overcome rapid antibody clearance or poor access to tumors as reported for antibodies that are injected as proteins. Genetic antibody therapy can be implemented by in vivo or ex vivo gene transfer (Fig. 18.3) , i.e., by direct injection of the gene transfer vector into patients or by gene transfer in cultures of previously isolated cells followed by injection of the resulting genetically engineered cells, respectively. Dependent on the design of the gene transfer vector, genetic antibody application can be transient or permanent, constitutive or inducible, targeted or ubiquitous. For example, retroviral vectors allow for stable gene transfer, inducible promoters facilitate control of antibody expression, and targeted vectors can direct gene transfer to specific cell types (see Sects. 18.1.2 and 18.1.3). Therefore, gene therapy possesses high potential and flexibility for implementing improved antibody delivery for specific applications.

Despite several proof-of-principal studies [19] [20] [21] [22] that have shown comparable diagnostic Sen and Spe when using other samples types (e.g. sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, bronchial washes, anterior nares swabs, throat swabs, and tracheal aspirates), processing of other specimen types and collection methods requires additional independent studies by the testing laboratory especially if results are used to make a clinical decision. Independent studies include analytical validation studies of lab-developed tests (LDTs) that establish comparable precision, accuracy, reference range, and reportable range. Laboratories are also required to assess additional assay performance characteristics (e.g. analytical specificity and analytical sensitivity and linearity) [23] . For surveillance testing, similar independent studies are required especially when results are reported to healthcare agencies for clinical purposes. However, because surveillance testing is used to establish disease trends and reveal etiology, a variety of sample types are often collected and processed since microbial load is unknown and may be higher in one type than another [24] . To report these results, surveillance labs are also required to perform additional independent validation studies or report results as Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only. The required additional validation of other sample types likely limits the adoption of multiplexed assays for surveillance purpose. Finally, there are differences between the number of samples typically processed for clinical diagnostic and surveillance work. Because effective clinical care depends on rapid turnaround time, clinical labs are more likely to process samples individually or in smaller batches. When identifying the source of an outbreak, rapid results are critical for control and prevention also requiring small batch testing. However, for routine surveillance whose aim is to trend population data, samples can be tested in large batches to minimize costs. However, large batch testing is often not possible for some multiplex assays due to the inherent design by manufacturers. For instance, both the FilmArray RP and the Nanosphere RP Flex can only process one sample at a time, while the Luminex NxTAG RPP and the eSensor RVP can process multiple samples at one time. It should be noted that if needed, both the FilmArray RP and the Nanosphere RP Flex allow for modular expansion to test more than one sample at a time but even then there are limitations to the number of samples that can be processed at one time. Thus, the need for surveillance labs to perform large batch testing has not been met which likely has slowed the adoption of respiratory multiplex assays by surveillance labs.",28.148899238670644,11.65060570188132

Ninety-eight percent of all homes were affected, 50% severely and 20% completely destroyed. 9 The Peace Corps brought in large numbers of prefabricated housing to replace all the destroyed homes. Although they were able to help a lot of people numerically, the homes they provided had two-sided pitched roofs instead of the typical Caribbean four-sided roofs that were better able to withstand tropical winds. They also did not have an interior design to allow for cross ventilation. The early recipients of the homes reported this finding to the Peace Corps, but the Peace Corps was unable to change the design. Though well intentioned, the Peace Corps was predominantly meeting the need projected by the donors instead of the actual needs of the victims. 9 Overdependence on vertical planning can also result in a lack of accountability and thus uneven recovery results.

However, keeping reservoir host colonies can require specific animal husbandry techniques, may involve training animals to accept available food sources not eaten in the wild, and can require access to special facilities to maintain the animals (such as aviaries to harbor bats or birds) and to perform infections with viruses that are often lethal to humans. Moreover, importing reservoir hosts from their country of origin can be costly, and quarantines are required to ascertain that they are free of the zoonotic pathogens dangerous to humans.

Instead of being able to learn from prior occurrences and create a more resilient town/infrastructure, the same mistakes are repeated over and over again. For example, Jamaicans used the stamps to fulfill daily needs such as mattresses and utensils and did not spend time reinforcing their homes against further hurricanes or floods. When the next hurricane hits, these people will have the same destruction to their homes as occurred with Hurricane Gilbert. 9 In the case of too little horizontal planning, the results may be a chaotic lack of cooperation between groups and potential leaders. Studies have shown that many community plans focus primarily on the emergency period and do not give adequate attention to recovery and reconstruction. If there is a plan, it often exists on paper only and in the case of an actual disaster it is not used. In fact, many officials are not aware that a plan exists. 4 These flaws lead to chaotic implementation of an ad hoc recovery. The community lacks the ability to work together and thus fragments and cannot unify to control its own affairs. As a result, the redevelopment is likely to be inadequate to fulfill the needs of the community. If there is aid from government and nongovernmental groups, they are sometimes uncoordinated, either duplicating actions, leaving areas without any aid, 4 or giving aid that is inadequate for the needs of the area. In Saragossa, Texas, a small isolated community that was devastated by a tornado in 1987, there was no local government in place at all. When a disaster advisory board was created, it was done without any input from the local inhabitants. The outcome was that the Saragossans considered themselves worse off 2 years after the tornado than they had been beforehand, both because of the quality of the rebuilt neighborhoods and because they felt they were looked on as helpless and ungrateful. 2 Studies in the Caribbean have shown that the different power levels in an uncoordinated community may lead to powerful interest groups pressuring public authorities to rebuild first in areas in which they have the greatest interest. Poorer neighbors with weaker ties to public authorities will get delayed care. 2 In the United States, vertical planning predominates because few communities have detailed plans in place and because they may not have the financial reserve to pay for the recovery. When a plan is in place before a disaster, it allows for a strong horizontal network. Then, when a useful vertical element is added, the results can work wonders. By 1975 recurrent floods had repeatedly decimated the town of Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin. Each time they rebuilt. At one point they added a dam, and they planned for a levee but were unable because of financial restrictions. They decided they would take the funds allocated for the levee and use it to plan for town relocation. Although federal funds were slow in coming, they did create a plan. In 1978, when the largest flood in the history of the area occurred, they were ready with a fully written strategy. When they were granted funds for reconstruction, they put their plan into effect. Not only did they relocate out of the flood plain to prevent reoccurrence of this destruction, but they decided to create a town that was 75% solar powered. 5 Because they had had the luxury of time in the planning stage, they had asked each business owner where they wanted to be located and how they wanted their business to be built.",24.94389600660157,8.240582277745139

This multicountry network of populationbased surveillance sites provides a platform to test a variety of interventions in settings where ecology, economics, ethnicity, politics, predominant co-morbidities and co-infecting pathogens, and behavior vary, thereby providing a useful tool to design optimal intervention strategies targeted to each setting. GDD IEIP surveillance data also provides a stimulus for more urgent development of novel vaccines and therapeutics for RSV and other diseases by demonstrating their burden and severity and are poised to assess the effectiveness, acceptance, and value of these tools compared with other prevention strategies. Given the consistency in laboratory testing methods, the approach to surveillance of respiratory infections undertaken by GDD IEIP sites enables comparison of the burden of RSV disease and its epidemiology among the 6 geographically and sociopolitically diverse countries. Longitudinal surveillance data from these sites, combined with those from GDD Influenza Program sites, will add to the global understanding of RSV-associated mortality and risk factors for severe disease and death in low-and middleincome countries, result in better descriptions of RSV seasonality, and inform intervention strategies to mitigate the burden of RSV-associated disease. The IEIP-run surveillance sites are well positioned to serve as platforms for future RSV vaccine efficacy or effectiveness studies in low-and middle-income countries, and to evaluate the utility and feasibility of RSV prophylaxis in these settings. Ultimately, the evidence generated by studies from GDD IEIP surveillance sites can inform countries' determinations of their public health priorities and generate the political will to implement effective prevention and control measures, through evidence-based policy change.",25.25604199969289,8.590701650194635

GPC has the potential to shape many attributes of individual phenotypes and/or the distribution of phenotypes in populations. Importantly, understanding what drives the evolutionary implications of GPC requires not only quantifying how GPC affects individual performance (i.e., estimating selection gradients) but also considering the patterns of phenotypic covariance within groups (or aggregations at other levels). Another key aspect to studying the impact of phenotypic variation is to quantify the extent to which individuals and those they interact with modulate each other's behaviours. How this underpins phenotypic covariance is rarely studied. A fascinating area for further theoretical and empirical research is the idea that these parameters can evolve (or coevolve), and this could potentially have profound effects on the dynamics of phenotypic adaptation. We emphasise the urgent need for theory to be expanded to support empirical research, and the need for future research that is tightly focused on the mechanisms determining the formation of groups in terms of individual phenotypes and group composition (for example, do groups reflect the underlying distribution of individuals in the wider population, or do individuals actively choose groups according to phenotypic composition?). We further emphasise the need for theoretical advances in understanding the co-evolution or co-dependence of group composition with the expression or value of individual phenotypes (through indirect effects). The study of the selective consequences and evolutionary outcomes of GPC is an area of increasing interest across a breadth of research areas.

Premature infants may not present with the classic respiratory or ''cold'' symptoms that are observed commonly in older infants and children, and therefore, the possibility that a viral respiratory pathogen is responsible for episodes of clinical deterioration is often not considered. The development of greatly improved molecular diagnostic methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens has allowed their precise identification in conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Despite the potential benefits, premature infants who are in fact at a higher risk for severe disease and outcomes, do not routinely undergo testing for respiratory viruses in the NICU. As shown by Gonzalez-Carrasco et al., PCR technology will aid not only in the recognition of respiratory viruses in premature infants in the NICU, but also in understanding the impact that these viruses have on their clinical care and disease processes. The awareness about the probable harmful role of respiratory viruses in premature infants is especially relevant in this era of family-centered care in NICUs, which by maximizing visitation by parents and families also carries the risk for the neonate's acquisition of traditional community pathogens resulting in hospital-associated infections. The prevalence of respiratory viral infections in the NICU was first documented in 2012 using PCR assays in a prospective surveillance study performed in 2 NICUs in the United States over a 1-year period. 2 Preterm infants <33 weeks of gestation who were in the NICU since birth underwent sequential NP testing for respiratory viruses up to the time of discharge. Fifty two percent of infants tested positive for a respiratory virus at least once during the study. Compared with infants that tested negative, virus-positive infants had significantly worse outcomes assessed by: longer length of stay, need and duration for intubation, more episodes of desaturation and duration of oxygen requirement, incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and more clinical deterioration episodes. The current study by Gonzalez-Carrasco et al. confirms these results in a different part of the world and using different PCR platforms, further emphasizing the need for respiratory viral testing in the NICU. 1 Over 18 months (9/2011---5/2013), the authors performed a prospective surveillance study for 16 respiratory viruses in the NICU mostly in preterm infants of <32 weeks' gestation but also in older gestational age infants who had underlying comorbidities and an anticipated length of stay in the NICU of >2 weeks. Testing for respiratory viruses in NP aspirates was performed the first day of age, then weekly until discharge, as well as whenever there were any respiratory symptoms defined as cough, respiratory distress, rhinorrhea, or apnea, regardless of the presence of fever. A respiratory virus was identified at least once during the NICU stay in 22% (13/60) of infants. The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus (RV), followed by adenovirus, coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Infants born at <32 weeks' gestation and with birth weight <1500 g tested positive for a respiratory virus more frequently than greater gestational age infants, possibly reflecting their more prolonged hospitalization, however transmission was not documented. Although duration of hospital stay was not significantly different between infants who tested positive and negative, BPD was more common in the viral positive group. The contribution that these respiratory viruses may have on development or worsening of BPD remains unknown. Unfortunately, other outcomes such as need and duration of oxygen therapy or invasive mechanical ventilation were not compared between the two groups.",26.409210424600634,10.004493076446163

Differences in the receptor usage by Ad serotypes provide the unique opportunity to exploit the natural diversity in Ad tropism in designing vectors for diverse gene therapy applications. It is critical to identify suitable vector candidates to specifically and efficiently target important cell types for preventive or therapeutic gene delivery applications. Notably, most of the receptors identified to date utilized by Ad belong to Ig superfamily. Additional cell surface components that are similar in structure and share homology with identified receptors may potentially function as at least low affinity attachment receptors either alone or in combinations with multiple molecules, to stabilize the virus particle and facilitate its accessibility to the internalization receptors on the cell surface. Though the receptor binding is thought to be one of the key determinants of Ad tissue tropism, it is not sufficient to explain all aspects of in vivo host-virus interactions. For instance, enhanced transduction of liver cells or Ad uptake by Kupffer cells appear to be independent of the receptor usage. Better understanding of structural and functional interactions between Ad and host cells/proteins is required for rational design of more effective and safe vectors. In addition, the knowledge of Ad virus-cell interactions could aid in making improvements to other vector systems such as nonviral vectors that utilize Ad translocation pathways to obtain effective gene or drug transfer.",21.9783737129294,8.795457919757872

In the USA, classification of waterborne outbreaks according to the strength of epidemiological, clinical, and environmental data now reflects the increasing use of molecular characterization of pathogens both in clinical and environmental samples [49] . However, outbreak investigations focus on specific incidents, and the contamination event will usually have passed some time before recognition of an outbreak. For understanding Cryptosporidium spp. transmission, baseline data need to be generated by well-structured sample surveys. Interventions such as those implemented to reduce waterborne disease need to be monitored for effectiveness, and one strategy is to compare population exposure. Various Box 1. Attributes of current Cryptosporidium faecal diagnostic assays Selection criteria include resources (staff time, expertise, grade, finances, specialist equipment), desired turnaround time, the population being tested, desired sensitivity and specificity, and the need to identify other pathogens. Preservatives can inhibit PCR and must be removed by washing; this may not be possible if the preservative has penetrated the oocysts. Faeces can be concentrated by sedimentation using modified formol-ethyl acetate or solvent-free techniques, but significantly fewer parasites and larger deposits have been reported in a solventfree system, and low-density parasites might be missed [86] . Conventional flotation (e.g., zinc sulphate, saturated sodium chloride or sucrose) results in cleaner preparations but low-density oocysts may be missed. Using fluorescent stains (e.g., Auramine O) oocyst observation is easier and less subjective, and slides can be scanned at lower magnification than acid-fast stained slides, but a fluorescence microscope is needed. IFM is less subjective than other microscopy stains and increases sensitivity and specificity, although some notable crossreactions (e.g., algae) may occur in food, water, and environmental testing, necessitating observation of confirmatory features: internal contents and sporozoites by differential interference contrast and sporozoite nuclei by staining with a nuclear fluorogen. EIAs can be automated and are more sensitive than acid-fast microscopy. Immunochromatographic lateral flow (ICLF) is less sensitive, but requires little skill and can be performed anywhere as a rapid test, for example pen-side.

Sequencing DNA from nested PCR of the SSU rRNA gene, using a repetitive and limiting PCR template approach to improve analytical sensitivity and differentiation of multiple species or genotypes in a single sample, provides the benchmark [54] . However, this is technically demanding, and is outwith the scope of most water-testing laboratories. A simplified approach is being validated using single-round, conventional, or real-time PCR of the SSU rRNA and hsp70 genes to differentiate the main human pathogens C. hominis, C. parvum, and C. meleagridis from other species commonly found in the environment (http://waterrf.org/Pages/Projects.aspx?-PID=4099). A non-PCR-based method is loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), based on autocycling strand-displacement DNA synthesis by Bst polymerase, and this may overcome the inhibitory potential of some samples and has been reported to detect organisms at relatively low concentrations in water samples [55] , although it has not yet been subjected to independent evaluation. Impact of genomics on detection, diagnosis, and typing Molecular biology had a vast impact on the understanding of the species concept within the genus Cryptosporidium, resulting in a dramatic increase in species numbers and genotypes [21] . As a result, there is a need to understand the level of within-species genetic variation such that selected DNA sequences can be indentified as references. This is particularly important because a single locus (the SSU rRNA gene) is often used as species marker; confidence in species determination and subtyping is greatly increased by using multiple markers that are spread throughout the genome [56] . Phylogenetic analysis has proven to be an essential tool for determining species status; this approach provides more information than is achieved through individual sequence comparisons (such as BLAST searches) because more weight is given to informative mutations that may be species-or group-specific [20, 54] . Use of reference sequences will help to reduce the confusion caused by sequences deposited in databases that may have been falsely attributed to a species due to limited understanding of species complexity at the time of submission. This is a considerable problem for a genus in which species numbers are still increasing.",23.75515965280599,8.722584672416827

At present, early cluster identification is notoriously difficult as many diseases are not notifiable, diagnostics can be relatively slow and biased for what we know, and clusters are not recognized when patients attend different healthcare facilities. One of the most overlooked but crucial aspects in identifying a potential foodborne related incident is the role that medical practitioners, veterinarians and epidemiologists, in other words the gatekeepers play in recognizing idiopathic disease cases or more than average occurrences of certain disease symptoms [40] . This is not a trivial task as these professionals need to recognize relatively uncommon or completely new infectious diseases, on the basis of changing clinical and epidemiological trends or a ""gut-feeling"", as syndromic surveillance systems targeting non-respiratory disease are sparse. Integrated networks for syndrome surveillance in combination with routine diagnostic surveillance activities for known pathogens in theory would aid in identification of threats which may otherwise fly under the radar.

Eligibility criteria that define the patients must be included. For the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, there may be a tendency to include only patients with confirmed H1N1. However, this could prove challenging if diagnostic testing is not 100% sensitive, or if confirmatory testing is not always available or is not be the same in each center (e.g., polymerase chain reaction vs. viral culture vs. enzyme-linked assay). Thus, confirmation may be foregone completely if demand outstrips capacity, making categories of confirmed, probable, and suspected valuable (14) . Similarly, although it is possible that H1N1 will comprise the majority of influenza burden in some jurisdictions in 2009 to 2010, it is reasonable to consider including all influenza and subcategorizing when this is known. This will allow comparison of clinical syndromes to other strains and simplify eligibility for study personnel when subtypes are not known. For a critical illnessfocused project, there should be some reasonable definition of ""critically ill."" Criteria should be defined according to the patient and the illness, not the geographic area of admission (e.g., the ICU). ICU admission criteria are not universal and are often dictated by institutional numbers of beds, which may be exceeded in pandemic periods or may not exist in parts of the developing world. Potential definitions of critical illness include ventilation failure (defined by clinical criteria or receipt of mechanical ventilation), oxygenation failure (defined by clinical criteria and/or receipt of high level of inspired fraction of oxygen), or hypotension (defined by clinical criteria and/or receipt of intravenous vasoactive medications) in any hospital area. If this non-ICU-centric approach is taken, then a mechanism for finding such patients is needed if they do not naturally come under the care of the critical care team. For case series, all and consecutive patients fulfilling the definition must be described to avoid the risk for selective reporting, which often leads to inclusion of the sickest patients-those who more obviously come to clinical attention because of illness severity. This can lead to falsely high mortality estimations in the early stages of pandemics.

Differences in the receptor usage by Ad serotypes provide the unique opportunity to exploit the natural diversity in Ad tropism in designing vectors for diverse gene therapy applications. It is critical to identify suitable vector candidates to specifically and efficiently target important cell types for preventive or therapeutic gene delivery applications. Notably, most of the receptors identified to date utilized by Ad belong to Ig superfamily. Additional cell surface components that are similar in structure and share homology with identified receptors may potentially function as at least low affinity attachment receptors either alone or in combinations with multiple molecules, to stabilize the virus particle and facilitate its accessibility to the internalization receptors on the cell surface. Though the receptor binding is thought to be one of the key determinants of Ad tissue tropism, it is not sufficient to explain all aspects of in vivo host-virus interactions. For instance, enhanced transduction of liver cells or Ad uptake by Kupffer cells appear to be independent of the receptor usage. Better understanding of structural and functional interactions between Ad and host cells/proteins is required for rational design of more effective and safe vectors. In addition, the knowledge of Ad virus-cell interactions could aid in making improvements to other vector systems such as nonviral vectors that utilize Ad translocation pathways to obtain effective gene or drug transfer.",22.673574957349622,9.038779556338541

These included outdated and vulnerable technologies; a public health workforce lacking training and reinforcements; lack of real-time surveillance and epidemiological systems; and ineffective and fragmented communications networks. 1 While considerable headway has been made since the IOM report was published, there is still evidence of a need for further improvements. A recent report by Trust for America's Health, for example, found that there are persistent gaps in the ability of state and local public health agencies to respond to events ranging from bioterrorist threats to natural disasters and disease outbreaks. 2 The question is-how can we reduce these gaps? Nationwide and globally, rapid changes in health information systems, cloud computing technologies, communications, and global connections are catalyzing a re-examination of disease surveillance as an enterprise that needs coordinated and integrated system elements. Sustainable surveillance, which we define as ongoing data collection, analysis, and application, coupled with a capability to respond to novel demands, is needed to ensure that public health agencies can perform reliably regardless of shifts in public health funding and priorities. The ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup identified the following steps to maintain and advance the public health surveillance enterprise:",24.035479967038395,7.355125084503686

PCR Positivity rates vary between 0 and 20% in non-BAL tested asymptomatic healthy adults [21] [22] [23] [24] and 14-68% in BAL tested samples from immunosuppressed adults with lower respiratory tract disease [20, 25, 26] . We found a 12-fold increase in pneumocystis identification using PCR in our other immunosuppressed group (connective tissues disease or solid organ transplant) and no change in our HIV/AIDS identification rate ( Table 3 ). The observed increase may be due to immunosuppressive therapies predisposing patients to infection with a lower burden of organism [27] , and may explain why microscopy is typically negative. The increase may also be due to a combination of the lack of specific prophylaxis recommendations in connective tissue disease treatment [28, 29] (only 9% of our patients in this group was on prophylaxis), the increased sensitivity of PCR testing, and the detection of reactivated latent [30] or self-limited pneumocystis infections. Based on our data PCR testing was equivalent to microscopy in diagnosing or excluding pneumocystis in HIV/AIDS patients. As a potential cost savings measure either test could be performed during BAL to diagnose or exclude pneumocystis in HIV/AIDS. Guidelines on using PCR to determine when treatment is necessary after detection of pneumocystis are currently lacking. Both Robert-Gangneux et al. (2014) and Maillet et al. (2014) found HIV/AIDS with pneumocystis pneumonia had lower PCR thresholds indicating a higher burden of organisms compared to non-HIV/AIDS patients they deemed colonized [20, 31] . We observed that HIV/AIDS and microscopy positivity had lower cycle time compared to non-HIV/AIDS and microscopy negative patients (Fig. 1) . We had six patients with PCR positivity only that had negative pneumocystis PCR testing on subsequent BAL testing. We would have expected persistent positivity if colonization occurred. We also had one patient with a cycle time difference of 13 when comparing non-BAL and BAL testing performed at the same time. This large difference makes using a single cycle time difficult in distinguishing when treatment is necessary. We think pneumocystis infection may occur on a spectrum, with high pneumocystis burden (low cycle time) requiring therapy while lower burden (high cycle time) being a self-limited process that may not requiring treatment. Compared to microscopy PCR testing is excellent at excluding disease as both Durand-Joly et al. (2005) [32] and our results found PCR testing to have 100% negative predictive value. (1,3)-Beta-D-Glucan testing calls into question the negative predictive value as we had four patients with positive testing and negative PCR testing.

If the research is capable of only addressing a narrow aspect of the original health concern, or if it can only address a tangential issue, then serious consideration is necessary as to whether it is prudent to proceed with the research.

The task for infectious diseases and epidemiology experts in the blood community is to be sensitive to this inevitability and to spend real effort anticipating which agents of many candidates pose material threats that bear forethought and planning. To that end, the emerging infections subgroup at AABB has engaged in developing a toolkit to guide that process (Fig. 10.3) . The most critical activity is ""horizon scanning"" that daily surveils a spectrum of online and print resources to identify new and emerging human pathogens. These include media reports, professional meetings, organizational and peer-reviewed publications, open source and subscription websites (e.g., ProMED [85] , CDC.gov, WHO.int, PAHO.org, and many others), and personal networks.

Furthermore, recent progress in our understanding of tumor immunology can link the information generated from gene-expression profiling of CNS tumors to the identification of precise immunogenic epitopes that can serve as useful targets for specific immunotherapy (Freije et al., 2004) . For instance, since T cells can only recognize antigens in the context of MHC, tumor-associated genes can be scrutinized for amino acid sequences that can interact with relevant MHC molecules and efficiently bind via the proteosomal degradation system. Candidate tumor-specific peptide epitopes for CTLs can now be identified using available computer algorithms that predict the MHC binding affinities of specific peptide and epitope sequences (http://bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/ hla_bind/, http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/kxi/). By subsequently testing the stability of MHC molecules with candidate tumor-specific peptides in vitro, an estimation of the potential immunogenicity of an in silico-identified antigen can be determined (Maecker et al., 2001) . The immunogenicity of human cancer genes or their predicted CTL peptide epitopes can also be assessed in animal models using HLA transgenic mice (Butterfield et al., 2001) , providing even better estimates for immunotherapy targets in vivo. Recently, experiments involving the screening of human tumor samples for CTL reactivity have identified human glioma-associated antigen epitopes to EphA2 and IL13Ra specifically recognized by the immune system and associated with extended survival (Okano et al., 2002; Ueda et al., 2007) .

The algorithm in Fig. 11 was inspired by previous work such as [22, 23, 34] . A key difference is the lack of an ad hoc design: no prior knowledge is assumed about existing motifs and the goal is to discover the motifs that are more likely to be part of the native structure. The algorithm of the Motif Identifier is simple but particularly powerful because it allows identifying complex structures such as pseudoknots. Lastly, since the design is modular new features such as different rank- ing functions can be easily added. The different tools in the Analysis component can be combined to perform more complex operations on the secondary structures. For instance, motifs that have been identified by the Motif Identifier can be aligned and compared by any of the alignment and comparison tools. Information on the consistency of the prediction results collected can be fed back to the database and made available to the segment sampler component to adjust the sampling strategy and adaptively identify new RNA segments for predictions.",24.61322455387354,10.738672812515139

Under these circumstances we need a theory of reasoning under uncertainty that tolerates the absence of quantitative data, provides an account of how to structure the decisions and modify this as circumstances change. In the rest of this section we address the first problem and turn to the second in the next. 7 Three examples of medical ""decision support systems"" are now outlined. These illustrate some common decisions that doctors face and show how they can be addressed with a non-probabilistic approach (Fig. 2) . The decisions do not depend upon the availability of precise probabilities and/or utilities but largely on qualitative or at most ""semi-quantitative"" rules. In these systems the specific argumentation processes are mathematically ad hoc yet the applications have proved to be surprisingly successful and robust; in Section 1.2 we shall describe a principled framework in which to build these and other argumentation systems.",26.520555604707702,9.900887583915418

A common view of such terms in logic is to treat them as modals, basing their semantics on a possible-world formulation. This is a well-developed position but expensive in the sense that modal logics have well known difficulties compared with standard predicate logic, and proving such logics as mathematically sound and complete is time-consuming and demanding. This may be an important thing to do if you are a logician, but not if you are trying to understand the use of modals in natural language or trying to build an agent that can use modal terms in its reasoning and user interface My position is that these so-called modal terms are ""epistemic states"", predicates that evaluate properties of collections of arguments about claims. The use of epistemic states may be mathematically ad hoc yet they provide a useful vocabulary for an agent to reflect upon its beliefs and their justification, and communicate succinctly with other agents about the confidence to be attached to its claims. In this respect we follow John McCarthy in his article ""Modality, Si! Modal logic, No!"" where he remarks ""Human practice introduces new modalities on an ad hoc basis. . . .

The reason is that when we were collecting samples, only a few of the serum samples were submitted with organs and some pigs were already dead when they arrived. It was decided that in the absence of equal samples numbers for serological testing and PCR, serological results could be inaccurate or unreliable. Antibody for PHEV is highly prevalent worldwide, and seropositive pigs remain subclinical [7] . This could be interpreted inversely to mean that reduced antibody titer might induce clinical signs. All the samples submitted to our lab were from clinically ill pigs. Thus, it was very likely that PHEV would be detected and so, presumably the antibody titer would be low.

(2003) and applied to FMD. This involves constructing an epidemic tree to summarize the course of infection by linking each infected farm to the donor that infected it. Contact tracing was used to identify some links, while other links were unknown and were constructed using ad hoc data-driven rules, such as the nearest potential donor, or a randomly selected farm from the set of potential donors weighted by a function of distance to the recipient. The notional effect of mooted interventions, such as swifter implementation of the national movement ban, could then be considered by removing branches of the tree. The approach enabled Haydon et al. (2003) to obtain estimates of disease levels under mooted interventions. Haydon et al. (2003) recognized these to be underestimates, reflecting an inherent bias in their methods, which allows only a single incoming branch to any recipient, so that when a mooted intervention results in the removal of a branch, the notionally non-infected host unit is considered safe from further infection, regardless of the infective pressure exerted upon it by other farms. Note that although the approach of Haydon et al.

Multiplexed molecular methods have been implemented for routine use in many clinical laboratories because of the methods' sensitivity, speed (more rapid than culture), ability to detect viruses that are difficult or impossible to culture, and ability to detect multiple viruses simultaneously. These assays are of high complexity and require a capital expenditure that may not be feasible for all laboratories. A testing algorithm that incorporates several methods may be the best strategy, but it is vital to consult all end-user groups, including medical staff, nursing, and administration, before implementation. The algorithm design would depend on the type of institution, patient demographics, how the information is going to be used for patient care, viral prevalence or seasonality in the area, whether detection of multiple viruses is important, how many viruses should be targeted, assay turn-around time, and if isolates are required for susceptibility testing. One such algorithm might be that more rapid but less sensitive antigen detection tests would be used first. This might be particularly useful in geographical regions with a high prevalence of the viruses detected by these tests. Positive results using these rapid tests would be reported and testing of those samples would stop. Samples with negative results would be tested with more sensitive assays, such as FA. Samples negative by FA would be tested by molecular diagnostics. Another algorithm might have FA as the first line of testing. Some laboratories might opt to run a multiplexed assay for those viruses considered treatable, of high clinical impact, or of high seasonal prevalence (such as influenza and RSV), while other laboratories might use a highly multiplexed assay that targets all available respiratory viral targets.",26.24718870615443,9.14226524296818

Subgroup analysis from the trial suggests that these antibiotic changes occurred predominantly in patients with exacerbation of airways disease testing positive for viruses, with little difference seen in antibiotic use in other clinical groups such as patients with community acquired pneumonia or in patients testing negative for viruses. Several observational studies support the findings of ResPOC, demonstrating a reduction in unnecessary antibiotics with rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in a variety of clinical setting. 15, 16 In addition a post hoc analysis from the trial itself suggests that the very rapid turnaround times for results seen with POCT compared to laboratory testing are critical in modifying antibiotic use in hospitalised patients. 17 Several rapid molecular test platforms for respiratory viruses are now available with the potential for deployment as POCTs in clinical areas and their use in hospitals is becoming more widespread. 18 However, there is a lack of evidence to inform clinicians and hospitals in the choice between multiplex syndromic panels such as the FilmArray RP, which test for a comprehensive range of respiratory viruses, and platforms that test for influenza only, or for influenza and RSV. Rapid, accurate influenza detection is clearly a priority for hospitals during periods of intense influenza transmission, to correctly and rapidly administer influenza antivirals and to efficiently utilise infection control facilities. In addition multiplex syndromic panels are more expensive than uniplex tests for influenza and it is not currently clear what additional clinical value is gained by testing for the other virus types in hospitalised patients.",23.611408247960245,8.785408816282374

Rationale, establishment and critical assessment of the multiplexed-tandem PCR assay A limitation of RT-PCR developed (Roeber et al., 2011 (Roeber et al., , 2012a was that it employs individual primer pairs for individual specific or generic amplifications and requires numerous, manual handling steps throughout the entire procedure. Therefore, the goal was to develop a user-friendly and practical platform that would allow the rapid testing of large numbers of samples at relatively low cost with limited manual intervention, and that could be introduced into a routine testing laboratory. Although conventional multiplex RT-PCR (e.g. Chamberlain et al., 1988) seemed to be a promising prospect at first, preliminary work conducted (Bott N.J. and Gasser R.B., unpublished) showed that primer sets used in individual PCRs (cf. Bott et al., 2009) could not be incorporated into a single reaction to achieve specific amplifications. Other restrictions of a conventional multiplex PCR approach are that each target sequence requires a probe for fluorescencebased detection at a particular wave length and that such probes are costly and require the use of multi-channel RT-PCR thermocyclers-which usually have only four to six distinct wave-length channels, thus limiting the number of species/genera that can be detected. In order to circumvent these issues, Roeber et al. (2012b) explored the use of multiplexed-tandem PCR (MT-PCR) (Stanley and Szewczuk, 2005) . MT-PCR consists of two amplification phases: (i) a primary 'target enrichment' phase (through a small number of PCR cycles) conducted using multiplexed primer sets and (ii) a subsequent analytical amplification phase (utilizing a diluted product from the primary amplification as a template), consisting of the targeted amplification, in tandem rather than by multiplex, of each genetic locus using specific, nested primers. Because the initial amplification phase is limited to 10-15 cycles, interactions between or among multiplexed primer sets is minimized, reducing competition or the generation of artefactual products and limiting amplification bias, which would otherwise prevent downstream quantification (Stanley and Szewczuk, 2005) . Because the primary amplicons are diluted (e.g. 100-fold) prior to use as templates in the secondary phase, primer carry over and PCR inhibition are substantially reduced. By conducting the secondary (analytical) amplification phase in tandem, the method can be coupled to a single-channel, RT-PCR thermocycler, allowing rapid screening and quantification employing one fluorogenic dye (e.g. SYTO9), thus reducing the cost associated with detection. Roeber et al. (2012b) established a high-throughput MT-PCR assay for the diagnosis of nematode infections in sheep, and critically assessed its diagnostic sensitivity and specificity relative to RT-PCR as well as conventional LC using faecal samples from different flocks of sheep from a broad geographical range in Australia. The MT-PCR achieved high diagnostic specificity (87.5%) and sensitivity (100%) based on the testing of a panel of 100 faecal DNA samples from helminth-free sheep and 30 samples from sheep with infections confirmed by necropsy. This MT-PCR assay was then used to test 219 faecal samples from sheep with naturally acquired infections from various geographical localities within Australia, and results were compared with those of LC, using 139 of the 219 samples. The MT-PCR and LC results correlated significantly for most nematodes examined, but parasites of the large intestine were significantly under-represented in the LC results. The findings showed that Trichostrongylus spp. (87%), Teladorsagia circumcincta (80%) and H. contortus (67%) had the highest prevalences, followed by O. venulosum (51%) and C. ovina (12%). Importantly, this MT-PCR allowed a species-or genus-specific diagnosis of patent nematode infections to be made within 24 h (compared with 7-10 days for LC).",22.675741368254407,8.957123088143403

Simply stated, the goal of mass critical care is to provide a few key interventions (those with the highest impact and potential to save lives) to many people rather then providing very resource intense interventions to a few [40, 46, 47] . All processes and procedures are open to modification and must be considered from a new perspective including standards of care, staffing, equipment, and the allocation of resources. Although there certainly is a need to modify the standard of care during a pandemic, one must always keep in mind the primary objective of ensuring that the maximum number of people possible, survive. Thus, caution must be exercised when expanding clinical roles or modifying management to ensure that care is not compromised beyond the point where more harm is being done than good. For instance, it is of little use to move to a ventilation strategy such as long term manual ventilation with bag-valve-masks that may allow many more people to be ventilated but results in an increased number of deaths due to barotrauma than would have occurred if fewer patients were ventilated using a less harmful ventilation strategy. Striking an appropriate balance requires monitoring treatment outcomes during the response.

However, it was soon discovered that the sensitivity of these rapid tests was very low for novel H1N1, leading to numerous false negatives. 7 Confirmatory testing consists of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or viral culture; this testing is usually obtained via state health department reference laboratories. The focus group participants stated that many patients with negative rapid tests were later found to be positive for novel H1N1 on RT-PCR or viral culture. The focus group participants identified various infection prevention issues resulting from the lack of a reliable rapid test for novel H1N1. One issue identified by the focus group members was the lack of consistency regarding the use of the rapid test for surveillance or treatment purposes. As one participant noted, ''We don't clearly define what we want the testing to provide for us. It's either a surveillance and/or a treatment modality.'' Many focus group participants emphasized that testing only lasted for a short period of time and had very specific rules regarding who could be tested. This caused a lot of confusion among the general public and made surveillance and control measures much more difficult for the focus group members. As one participant explained it, ''That's one of the reasons the decision was made to stop [testing] because we knew [novel H1N1] was out there. So what's the point? We're not going to treat [the infected individuals]. We're not going to do anything unless they're admitted, critically ill, etc.'' Another focus group member relayed her experience with the public's perception about rapid testing:",28.13774280455184,9.819269759925854

There was no understanding if residents would be expected to provide surge staffing or if they would be stratified by experience. 13 Though most hospitals train nurses and attendings for mass-casualty events, fewer than half train residents. 14, 15 This is a gap in medical education that should be addressed as these incidences are unfortunately becoming more frequent. Most resident staffing during crises is managed ad hoc by chief residents or program directors. Communications should be in place, whether by group text, online meeting applications or other local mechanism, so that chief residents act as a liaison between institutional command, attending physicians and resident teams. It is likely that trainees could be asked to work beyond scheduled duty hours. Local graduate medical education leadership should be involved in preparations, and knowledge of ACGME program requirements is essential. It is possible residents will be asked to work beyond accepted duty hours, and these exceptions should be made known to the ACGME, but exemptions should be provided given the national emergency. Graduated autonomy and extension of attending physicians by senior residents as well as battlefield promotions of fellows and Chief Residents will be the most logical progression as the response to the crisis escalates and personnel are furloughed or quarantined.",26.582071292814504,11.375072117592804

In some countries, risk or indicator species are regularly tested where clinical signs are well known and recorded. Table 5 gives the recorded cases of EBLV in bats across Europe by country (where positive cases are documented by laboratory analysis testing for viral RNA in brain or saliva samples).

Effective surveillance is a vital component of any policy that helps to maintain the rabies-free (virus/disease) status of a specific country. The apparent lack of EBLV surveillance in some areas of Europe may be due to classical rabies in fox populations being seen as having greater direct importance, both economically and for public health (Warrell and Warrell, 2004) . The WHO defines an area as 'rabies-free' where an effective import policy is implemented, and where the area is currently free of indigenous rabies in terrestrial mammals, with no new indigenous case being reported for a period of two years. Currently the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) ex-cludes bat rabies when declaring a country rabies-free (Mü ller, 2002) . During the period 1985-1987, there was a noticeable increase in the number of bats submitted for rabies testing within Europe. The increase in submission numbers of bats, the human case of EBLV-2 in Finland in 1985, and a biting incident involving E. serotinus in Denmark in 1985 (MMWR, 1986) led to EBLV surveillance being taken more seriously.",26.086984106247893,8.940059927679195

In the future, more studies should directly measure the efficacy of influenza interventions throughout the entire influenza season and over multiple influenza seasons. It would be helpful to establish more consistency in study design, execution, outcome measurement and reporting. Knowing the proportion of infected children who exhibit clinically apparent symptoms will help better estimate influenza's true burden, transmission patterns and intervention impact. Improved diagnostics will help design and execute studies, target preventative interventions and elucidate the symptomaticasymptomatic split. Studies should capture and report when during the influenza season its subjects were immunized as this timing can greatly influence the vaccine's impact. Also, it may not be enough to simply promote immunization without also expounding on the value of getting immunized earlier. Continuing suboptimal implementation of preventative measures (e.g., low vaccination coverage) calls for new strategies to overcome potential barriers. Vaccine development is proceeding in two general directions: improving vaccine efficacy and administration. The uncertainty over when and how to use antivirals calls for more RCTs that measure the timing of antiviral administration in relation to exposure and account for social contact patterns. The dearth of data on nutritional supplements prevents specific recommendations. Better characterizing social contact patterns and transmission dynamics can help better assess the value of current and developing interventions. There is a need for more economic studies of both current and future interventions.

To be useful, the reference must contain detectable levels of all genes expressed in samples co-hybridized with it, therefore the reference is often a pooled sample of all experimental conditions. This design often makes the assumption that the effect of dye bias is equal across all comparisons with the reference (Maindonald et al. 2003) as the reference is generally labeled with the same dye on each array. Therefore any gene-specific dye bias not removed by normalization will affect all arrays in a similar fashion (Simon and Dobbin 2003) . One reason for using this design is when there is hmited availability of RNA from one or all of the samples. The orientation of dye labeling is applied in the same direction so that samples for comparison are always labeled with the same dye and the reference is always labeled with the same dye (Churchill 2002) . For spotted arrays, this design uses an aliquot of common reference RNA as one of the samples co-hybridized to each array so that comparisons between the reference and sample of interest can occur on the same spot (Simon and Dobbin 2003) . In the opinion of Maindonald et al. (2003) a direct pair-wise comparison for two treatments should be more precise than indirect comparison of all treatments through a reference. Similarly, Churchill (2002) argues that use of a reference sample is tmnecessary and results in inefficient experiments as half of the gene-expression measurements are made on the reference sample which is generally of no interest to the researcher.

The exposed, peptidic trimer base, a neo-epitope on the soluble SOSIP trimers, was also preferentially targeted by non-neutralizing antibodies (56) . These studies highlight the preference of the adaptive immune response to protein epitopes over glycan-containing epitopes, and the hurdles inherent in HIV vaccine design. Strategies to knock-out particular glycans in the priming immunogen and reintroduce them in subsequent boosting immunogens is an active area of research to help overcome these challenges.",21.86051652763633,8.681769462198236

The term ""repeatability"" refers to the replication of experiments within the same laboratory using the same procedures, materials, and operators. ""Reproducibility"" concerns testing on different equipment, usually at different locations, but using the same lot of materials and testing procedures. The reproducibility of wear data is important for those developing standard test methods, those whose jobs involve quality control of a manufactured product or material, and commercial firms who buy products on the basis of wear or durability requirements. In the latter case, the customer may test some fraction of the products he or she buys in order to ensure that the durability data from the supplier matches that of the delivered products when tested under similar conditions. Depending on the situation, repeatability and reproducibility (R/R) may serve different purposes in scientific studies, materials engineering, and manufacturing.",22.781751601934666,8.302637084984859

The specimen of choice for the detection of respiratory viruses is a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) or a nasal wash [10, 14] . But both have their own disadvantages such as unpleasantness of the procedure, need for a suction device in the case of NPA, and the attendant risk of aspiration and generation of aerosol during the collection of nasal wash. Hence, these procedures are not feasible for widespread use in clinical practice. In contrast, collecting a nasopharyngeal swab is easy, painless, can be performed anywhere and does not require any additional device. Also, the, newly developed flocked swabs (which were used in the study) are more sensitive, and less traumatic for pediatric patients, and are also more acceptable to the parents [21] . The absence of a single test to detect all the etiological agents is the greatest hurdle in determining the etiological agent for cases with LRTI. Multiplex PCR has overcome this hurdle to some extent: it has the potential to both reduce the overall use of antibiotics and to improve the targeted use of antibiotics, which in turn can help control nosocomial transmission of viruses. However, the kit detects only the organisms mentioned above, and therefore may have missed other viruses and bacteria contributing to ALRTI. This may explain the 18 negative samples in the study. High concordance between the viruses identified using multiplex PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates and those identified by studying pulmonary samples in patients with acute respiratory infections in previously published literature [26, 27] provides confidence that the organisms identified in this study in the nasopharyngeal aspirates were responsible for the lower respiratory infections. A case control study would be beneficial to know the presence of these viruses and bacteria in an asymptomatic infant. This could be an area of future research.",21.144313042674128,8.288648084163448

That raises the question: Why do so many wear paper authors base general conclusions on only one or two tests per set of test conditions? In the author's experience, there are at least seven possible reasons for this shortcoming: 1) Investigators are inadequately trained in the scientific method or may have forgotten that repetition and verification of results are central components of good science. 2) Investigators ignore the fact that wear data, like other physical measurements, exhibit a degree of variability. 3) Experiments may be too costly or too time-consuming to repeat, even though the researcher acknowledges that repetition improves overall confidence in the data. 4) Only a small amount of experimental material is available for testing. 5) Wear is used as a metric to measure the effects of processing, material composition, or surface treatment variables. With emphasis shifted toward processing, there is inadequate attention paid to the true meaning and repeatability of the wear data itself. 6) Business or program deadlines must be met. These include conference paper deadlines, a sponsor's demanding results, project deliverable deadlines, the need to publish, to graduate the next class of students, and a need to move on to the next Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/wear project.

Research priorities to reduce this knowledge gap include: • Detailed outbreak investigations in schools (before, during, and after closure) along with detailed follow- Review up of households of students. Such studies will provide information on the health benefi ts for students and their families and allow better understanding of transmission dynamics within the school and school-household interactions. Outbreaks that are investigated are usually atypical, in the sense that they are expected to be larger than an average school outbreak. Caution is therefore necessary when extrapolating from those outbreaks to nationwide estimates. For this reason, a metaanalysis will be particularly useful. • As part of the same studies, the economic and social impact of the closure on households should be established. Linking the epidemiological and economic components of household questionnaires will allow investigation of the cost-eff ectiveness of the intervention. • Collecting data on activities and interactions with other children during school term and during school closure. So far, the absence of such data reduces our ability to assess the eff ect of school closure on infl uenza spread, namely we do not know how mixing patterns of children outside school are modifi ed when schools close (so-called compensatory behaviours). • Assessing the eff ect of school closure on transmission in the wider community (ie, not just children and their families). This will be more challenging since it will require collecting good incidence data at a geographical resolution that matches the catchment area of the schools. Such spatial resolution cannot be achieved with traditional surveillance networks, so non-conventional approaches (such as polls organised by phone or on the web) will have to be considered. • There is also a need to refi ne our understanding of the implications of school closure for health-care and other essential services. This could be done through surveys of health-care managers and workers.",21.592854961376492,8.240763798969374

Numerous manufacturers and instruments are available for testing several different organisms. Influenza virus PCR has many advantages over conventional diagnostic techniques, which include culture and rapid antigen tests. Recovering influenza in culture takes several days, which is far too long to wait to begin therapy. Rapid antigen tests, although fast and easy to perform, are plagued with low sensitivity. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing, although relatively fast, is dependent upon collecting cells in a sample and it requires a fluorescent microscope. Nucleic acid tests can be performed in a time frame that is meaningful to patient management, is highly sensitive and specific, and many manufacturers offer assays that require minimal hands-on time and minimal expertise in the basics of molecular diagnostics.

This dataset, which we used for further analysis, includes 110 genomes produced using multiplex PCR amplification (amplicon sequencing) and a subset of 37 genomes produced using hybrid capture (out of 66 attempted). Because these approaches amplify any contaminant ZIKV content, we relied heavily on negative controls to detect artefac- tual sequence, and we established stringent, method-specific thresholds on coverage and completeness for calling high-confidence ZIKV assemblies (Figure 4.1A) . We typically include a water sample (or a sample from a completely different virus, such as EBOV) when preparing samples for sequencing, and thus used ZIKV content in these negative controls as a proxy for the level of contamination present in that particular batch of samples.

An understanding of the basic principles that preside over the generation of viral diversity and how some viral forms help or replace others should be based not only on indirect evidence but also on the design of experiments in which a limited number of variables can be examined.

To further complicate matters, significant interlaboratory discordance of detection rates have been recorded for some assays. 76, 77 The diagnostic yield from PCR is consistently greater than for culture when testing nasopharyngeal samples for Bordetella pertussis. 27 PCR remains positive for a longer period after the onset of symptoms and thus is useful for individuals who present late in their illness. 78 In the investigation of a pertussis outbreak, the combination of PCR and culture for samples obtained 2 weeks or less after illness onset and PCR alone for samples obtained more than 2 weeks after illness onset proved to be the most diagnostically useful. 79 PCR has greater sensitivity than cytologic methods for the detection of Pneumocystis jiroveci, although it has been difficult to interpret the common finding of PCR-positive samples that are negative by standard methods. 27 The latter may reflect P jiroveci colonization of uncertain clinical significance. The performance of PCR has been shown to vary with different assays, 80 although the results correlate well with clinical evidence of pneumocystis pneumonia. 81 The need for improved diagnostic methods for tuberculosis has focused attention on the potential role of NAATs. Advances in this area have been relatively slow, with NAATs for mycobacteria failing to provide greater sensitivity than culture-based methods. The relatively high false-negative rate with NAATs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis probably reflects a combination of the paucibacillary nature of samples, presence of inhibitors in samples, and suboptimal DNA extraction methods. The situation is changing, with new developments in rapid diagnosis and antibiotic susceptibility testing. 82 For direct detection of M tuberculosis in respiratory samples, all commercial assays have high specificity (>98%), but variable sensitivities: 90% to 100% for smear-positive samples and 33% to 100% for smear-negative samples. 27 Consequently, it is recommended that use of these tests is restricted to only smearpositive samples. Evaluations of PCR for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in high-prevalence populations have been promising. [83] [84] [85] [86] Alternative strategies under development to diagnose tuberculosis by molecular tools include detection of mycobacterial DNA in urine 87, 88 and direct detection in respiratory specimens by microarray. 89 ",25.505902355051035,9.418071738181112

Three syndromes caused by BVDV have been described: an acute gastroenteritis with severe diarrhoea, mucosal disease, and chronic infections of several weeks' dnration in calves up to l-year-old. Persistently infected animals are the main source of infection to herdmates because they continually shed large quantities of virus in body secretions and excretions. Due to the obvious impact of B\q)V infections, screening of animals must be carefully made and current methods of detection, such as virus isolation or immunoassays, either lack optimal sensitivity or rapidity for consistent and large scale testing in animal specimens (Radwan et al., 1995) . PCR, however, can readily detect B\q)V (Belak & Ballagi-Pordany, 1991; Brock, 1991; Hertig el aL, 1991; Ward & Misra, 1991; Hoft van Iddekinge et al., 1992; Gruber el aL, 1994) , and PCR analysis of hulk tank milk samples has provided a rapid and sensitive method to screen herds for the presence of the virus. Sensitive studies using reference strains of BVDV fi-om persistently infected carriers have shown that reverse transo-iption (RT)-PCR has greater sensitivity than other tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Horner el aL, 1995) ; unfortunately, cost currently makes this technique unsuitahle for large-scale testing but it should be valuahle as a coniirmatm T test in cases where ELISA resuhs are in the 'suspicious range' or where the viral titre is low, such as in batches of foetal bovine serum. Additionally, it is possible to discriminate among different BVDV strains using PCR (Tajima el al., 1995) and PCR-restriction fi'agment length polymorphism (RFLP) tests have demonstrated that 13 B\q)V isolates fi'om ruminants on four different farms in Sweden were herd-specific rather than speciesspecific, and that the virus is readily transmitted between cattle and sheep (Paton et al., 1995) .",21.573782060386662,8.395561797017528

Indeed, the effective reproduction number estimated during the early epidemic growth phase quantifies the transmission potential of an infectious pathogen, in turn informing the likelihood of large-scale outbreaks and the intensity of control interventions needed to stamp out the outbreak [7, 8] . Early estimates of >1.0 for the reproduction number indicate the potential for a major outbreak, and estimates of <1.0 indicate that small transmission chains are possible but that the infection will quickly die out before a large-scale epidemic can be generated.

Molecular technologies allow for the rapid identification of genetic material of biological agents from collection devices such as those used for outdoor and indoor air monitoring. Public health, forensic, and laboratory assessments must be made based on material collected in a distinct area covered by the monitor or sensor. Because these detectors or devices do not preserve the viability of the agent, the assessment cannot indicate that a live organism was released, that individuals were exposed, or that a deliberate release occurred. As a result, it is critical that information from public health and epidemiological investigations be considered when interpreting information from environmental monitors. Public health must consider the limits of these new technologies, previous history of environmental detection of a biological agent in each area, and environmental sampling methods. As the recent Institute of Medicine report on ""Effectiveness of National Bio-Surveillance Systems: Biowatch and the Public Health System"" indicated, the challenge is ""understanding the clinical context in which disease detection and reporting occurs and the factors that shape the decision-making process for the state and local public health officials who must interpret the data"" from these systems as well as that from traditional public health surveillance systems (Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of the National Academies, 2009).",22.278015930692227,7.871562379675811

The experience of many is that cats housed with FIVinfected animals may remain uninfected over periods of years.

Enhanced surveillance and diagnosis of respiratory illness has the potential to reduce health-care costs enormously (Halasa et al., 2005; Esposito et al., 2006) but there are still significant gaps in our knowledge concerning the range of pathogens which cause respiratory infection and disease, with many cases going undiagnosed. Respiratory virus detection and diagnosis is complex because of the wide range of viruses (and other pathogens) which can present with the same clinical symptoms. Empiric treatment of patients, without a clear diagnosis, may result in implementation of expensive and disruptive public health measures as well as lead to increased spread of the disease. The seasonality of some respiratory viruses is well recognized, and viral surveillance and laboratory-based diagnostics are important to guide timing of prophylaxis and other interventions. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) peaks during winter months each year [although the start and finish of the season varies (Alonso et al., 2007) ] and it is important to track seasonality for planning prophylaxis in vulnerable children.

The most likely source of this pathogen was from ingestion of contaminated food obtained from the local ""cafeterias"" situated adjacent to the Crow Valley camps. Of the personnel who experienced diarrhea, 9/10 (90%) reported having eaten food from the local ""cafeterias."" This observation is similar to other studies that correlate an increase in the incidence of diarrhea with an increase in time spent off-base, suggesting increased exposure and consumption of locally prepared food and drinks. 6 Although the number of cases was small, 5 of the 7 Campylobacter cases occurred on the 5th day after the start of the exercise, which most likely refl ected the incubation period of the pathogen after initial exposure. Given the relatively short duration of the exercise, some individuals who were infected with an enteric pathogen may not have exhibited symptoms until after the conclusion of the military exercise and thus would not have been captured by the surveillance. Therefore, there may have been more cases than were actually captured. Surveillance continued for at least 1 week after the military exercises may have given a somewhat more complete picture of infectious disease incidence and etiology. 22 The information gathered from this laboratory-based surveillance program could potentially be useful during future exercises to decrease morbidity from diarrheal illness. For example, providing food sanitation training to local vendors and/or restricting access to locally purchased food could potentially decrease the number of diarrheal illnesses. Sensitizing medical staff at the BAS to etiologies of acute diarrhea may allow for more targeted counseling and treatment of military personnel. The fact that 8 of the 10 diarrheal cases were positive by PCR for some enteric pathogen indicates that under the conditions of this surveillance, PCR testing on frozen stool specimens from the fi eld is a viable approach to identifying etiological enteric agents. The limitation of this approach is that culture and, therefore, sensitivities of the pathogens are not available. However, in certain situations, maintaining frozen specimens may present a viable and feasible alternative to attempting to culture enteric pathogens within a prescribed time frame. In terms of the respiratory cases, all the nasal specimens that were collected were negative for infl uenza by PCR testing. A likely explanation is that the military exercise occurred in the summer months and the infl uenza virus was not actively circulating among the military personnel or in people within the camp vicinity during that period. However, 4 out of 6 respiratory specimens were positive for H. infl uenzae , which suggests that this pathogen was a signifi cant cause of morbidity during this deployment.

In a study conducted among 250 personnel (25.6% of whom were physicians or nurses) serving at 2 Hajj mission hospitals during the 2004 season, a 22.6% attack rate of acute respiratory infections during and after the Hajj was observed with acute respiratory infections defined by the association of at least 1 constitutional symptom (fever, headaches, and myalgia) and at least 1 respiratory symptom. 12 In a study conducted among 120 HCWs from the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) and other Hajj medical missions during the 2009 season, 10.6% reported respiratory symptoms during the Hajj, and 12.5% were found infected by at least 1 virus post-Hajj comparing to 7.5% pre-Hajj using a PCR assay. 6 All positive cases were due to rhinovirus, but 1 post-Hajj case was due to coronavirus 229E. 6 We confirm in the current work that HCWs attending ill Hajj pilgrims present frequently with respiratory symptoms (29%) during and soon after the Hajj period. Additionally, we show that diarrhea is rare (3%). Such symptoms were not observed in another cohort of HCWs attending non-pilgrim patients in another region of Saudi Arabia during the same period of time. HCWs attending pilgrims reported symptoms that lasted up to 2 weeks. No symptomatic HCWs reported loss of workdays during the Hajj in our study, and the number of sick days because of illness post-Hajj was not recorded. Nevertheless, illness during or post-Hajj among HCWs does not only affect the wellbeing of the HCWs involved, but may also have an impact on work productivity, delivery of health care services, as well as potentially an economic cost. This is especially relevant during Hajj when the health care system is under a significant amount of stress and operating at near surge capacity in many Hajj areas. Numerous studies reported that employee absence is related to decreased job productivity and important economic costs including in the health care sector.

An important focus has been on the development of new animal based Ad vectors, especially Ad vectors of simian origin. While most of these vectors are in pre-clinical phases of development, some, including ChAd3 and ChAd63, have reached clinical trials. Selection of alternative Ad serotypes has been mainly driven by the absence of neutralizing Ab against these serotypes in the human population. However, the impact of Ad specific T cells on the efficacy of these vectors has been mainly overlooked. This is in part due to the complex nature of T cell assays that are designed to detect anti-Ad T cell responses. Compared with nAbs assays, T cell assays require complex stimulatory conditions and/or multi-parametric flow cytometry. The study of Ad specific T cell responses are further complicated by the presence of TRM that do not circulate in the blood. Isolation of these T cells usually requires mechanical and/or enzymatic disruption of the tissue of interest. These isolation procedures can affect T cell viability and function, which further complicates analysis of TRM cells. In addition, for obvious ethical reasons, isolation of TRM cells is restricted to animal models for most tissues except the skin and gut. Although harder to obtain, information regarding both Ad specific circulating and tissue resident T cells is necessary for a full understanding of pre-existing immunity against Ad vectors and to select the most appropriate Ad vector for clinical use. Therefore, the ability of Ad specific T cells in the target population to cross-react with the Ad vector being developed (chimpanzee, porcine, bovine, ovine) should be systematically investigated.",25.331308405321344,9.103336211668974

Most primer databases, including PrimerBank (2,3), RTPrimerDB (4–6) and qPrimerDepot (7), contain primers for general use in real-time PCR and qPCR in specific organisms such as human, mouse, rat, fruit fly and zebrafish but do not contain primers for virus detection. The NCBI Probe Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/probe/) provides nucleic acid reagents for use in a wide variety of biomedical research applications such as RNAi, PCR and microarray, as well as primers and probes for the detection of some viruses. However, its primers and probes are designed under various different filtering constraints and not validated against other viruses. Thus, they might not be appropriate for use in qPCR experiments requiring a full set of primer pairs that satisfy the same constraints, or in experiments requiring no cross-reactivity with different viruses.

However, the database has not been updated with new entries for a number of years (the last update was in 2003). Primer-BLAST (9), one of the most widely used web-based tools for primer design, performs target-specific similarity testing. However, it is not suitable for designing PCR primers for RNA viruses, primarily for two reasons. First, it can perform similarity testing only within the same species. That is, it cannot perform similarity testing of a candidate primer designed to detect a specific virus in human that is related to two different species. For the same reason, it cannot design a primer to detect specific virus(es) in a host infected by multiple viruses. Second, it does not support batch design of primers for multiple segments of a virus, which is essential to ensure accurate detection in multi-phase PCR experiments. Accordingly, this lack of public resources prevents efficient detection of viruses in hosts, representing an obstacle to a more comprehensive understanding of viral disease.",26.604686834913885,9.985640433406669

The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription. The trial was stopped after 17 months before reaching the prespecified sample size due to dwindling funds and slow enrollment. However, there was a trend toward decreased antibiotic use with RP testing (–12% difference; P = .06/0.08, chi-square/Fisher exact test) that was larger in pediatric patients (–19% difference; P = .047/0.07) in an age-stratified post hoc analysis, suggesting a potential benefit of increased rapid RP testing in some ED patients. Antiviral prescription (ie, oseltamivir) was not significantly affected despite a 3-fold increase in viral (66% vs 20%) and influenza detections (26% vs 8%), perhaps due to the lack of guidance regarding antiviral use in our study. Other secondary outcomes, such as ED disposition, 30-day return visits, and 30-day deaths, did not differ between groups. Thus, the main effects of rapid RP testing in this study were to increase the proportion of patients with a lab-confirmed viral detection for clinical decision-making by 3-fold and reduce antibiotic prescription by about one-third. It is unknown if similar benefits could be achieved with targeted testing for influenza and/or RSV or antimicrobial stewardship alone.

The multiplicity of species which can be arrayed on a single-DNA chip allows a high multiplexing capability, with the possibility of identifying many different targets at one time (3). Single-base variations by microarray analysis can be detected by differential hybridization techniques using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (4), or by enzyme-mediated detection methods (5).

In genotyping experiments, this is accomplished on the basis of the already-known information about each single-base variation.

The sample size is adequately powered. However, some limitations should be addressed. First, we evaluated the acceptability of the healthcare workers at a relatively early stage of the programme, and there exists the possibility that their opinions and perception may change overtime. In addition, the response rate of the survey was modest, and thus a biased sample might have been recruited. Hence, a major limitation of this study included the inability of the researchers to characterize the nonresponders, since the only information we have for these nonresponders was their contact methods. Nevertheless, there are no concrete, plausible explanations why the responders and nonresponders should be different with respect to their intention to accept ad hoc influenza vaccines. Furthermore, this acceptability survey captured opinions of healthcare workers but not what they would practice in reality.

The lesions were regarded as distributed in the upper lung zone when they were located above the hilum, in the lower lung zone when they were located below the hilum, or random when the distribution could not be determined. For the acquisition of CT scores, the lung was also divided into upper (above the carina), middle (below the carina and up to the inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein) zones.

Despite the known heterogeneity of tumors, calling of somatic variants is often limited to those in a majority of the cells or performed using ad hoc approaches (10,32,41). In addition, since tumor samples are often contaminated with normal tissue, the ability to robustly detect somatic mutations can be critical. In particular, results from a samtools analysis of 14 exome sequencing datasets for gastric tumor/normal paired samples from Zang et al. (32) revealed an asymmetric frequency distribution for the somatic SNVs called, suggesting that sample contamination can lead to significantly reduced sensitivity even with high sequencing coverage (Supplementary Figure S4). Re-analysis of these datasets with LoFreq helped to recover the full distribution (Figure 2), revealing the value of a systematic approach to call low-frequency somatic SNVs even when the goal is to only identify heterozygous and homozygous variants in high-coverage datasets.

The sensitivity/specificity tradeoff results here suggest that while model-based approaches (SNVer, Breseq) provide an improvement over ad hoc approaches, further significant gains in sensitivity are possible (without loss in specificity) using a quality-aware approach (LoFreq).

It is observed that the reduction of mobility due to the confinement of the population has a highly nonlinear effect on the reduction of the epidemic. This makes the task of policy makers notoriously difficult, as they need to design realistic, implementable, confinement measures that reduce the impact of the epidemic sufficiently within the shortest time frame possible. If the interventions planned are too weak, the epidemic will not cease and the surge capacity of healthcare systems will be surpassed, leaving many individuals requiring hospitalization out of the attention they need. Furthermore, once policy makers realize the insufficiency of the interventions put in place, the epidemic may have spread up to a point such that only the most severe interventions will be of real use. On the other side, implementing very strict confinement measures from an early stage would give governments a much needed time to prepare against the attack of the disease, but would most likely take a huge toll in the economy, and consequently, in the population.",17.507975270847414,6.2875595745195705
