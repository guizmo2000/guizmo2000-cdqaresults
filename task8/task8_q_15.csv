Our SFTSV-N protein based systems detect IgG and IgM separately, so it can distinguish previous or recent infection, respectively. The serum dilution is 1:1000 for IgG and 1:400 for IgM; this greatly save the serum used and will be quite beneficial for precious samples and large scale epidemiological studies.

Expansion of sedentary agriculture and large-scale irrigated agricultural projects, besides diminishing the existing traditional pastoral territories, can have significant impact on the ecology and welfare of downstream inhabitants. In Borana, community responses to changing land use resulted in the development of range enclosures, the expansion of crop farming and fragmentation of communal rangelands, while the suppression of fire contributed to expansion of bush encroachment (further detail on the latter is given below). The overall impact has been forage scarcity and greater vulnerability of livestock during drought years (Angassa and Oba 2008) . In the past, the lower limit for sedentary agriculture and the upper limit for the rangelands were considered to be the escarpments receiving 500 to 700 mm of annual rainfall. Areas found in this range and below are actually marginal for rain-fed agriculture. However, due to population pressure and overexploitation of croplands in the adjacent highland areas, the rangelands are being encroached by sedentary crop cultivators.",17.003475229916617,9.219578661861197

In a similar fashion, the field of functional immunomics has now come of age as a result of advances in sequential immunomics, which consists of methods to catalogue the chemical/biological targets capable of eliciting an immune response, also known as epitopes. Computational and statistical methods are now available for automated large-scale epitope prediction (please see the next subsection), in addition to classical immunoassays such as ELISPOT [19] and tetramer staining by flow cytometry [20] that together enable high throughput identification of epitopes. Recently, a coordinated effort has been initiated by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the US National Institutes of Health, under the auspices of the Large-Scale Antibody and T Cell Epitope Discovery Program (in which the authors of this paper participate), to create an integrated immunome database and resources such as a toolbox of epitope prediction methods. This initiative is designed to identify immune epitopes from selected infectious agents; the information will be made freely available to scientists worldwide through the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) [7, 21, 22] (http://www. immuneepitope.org). The sequencing information produced by this and other epitope mapping efforts being carried out will be essential for the construction of immunomic microarrays (discussed in detail below), leading to an experimental paradigm similar to that employed in functional genomics.",22.29840122901813,11.064954355708712

The threat of new and re-emerging infectious diseases is increasingly recognised as one of the more likely and potentially devastating events that humanity could face in the coming decades. 1 Despite their disproportionate share of disease burden in terms of morbidity and mortality in some parts of the world, communicable infectious diseases are not only the concern of developing countries. 2 Malaria, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)/AIDS, tuberculosis, dengue fever, and West Nile fever still affect a large number of Asian, American, and European countries. In addition, over the past 2 or 3 decades, western and developed countries have faced growing threats from vector-borne emerging infectious diseases (EID) such as chikungunya fever, dengue fever, West Nile fever, and Lyme disease. [3] [4] [5] Urbanisation, climate change, globalisation, migration, and other socio-ecological factors are recognised as primary conditions that could lead to possible large-scale outbreaks of arboviral diseases. [6] [7] [8] For most diseases caused by these viruses, there is no available treatment or vaccine, and populations in developed countries have not experienced them at epidemic levels. Even though no large-scale epidemics have occurred yet in Europe, recent alerts have brought to light the risk of mosquito-borne infectious diseases. [9] [10] For example, a major epidemic of chikungunya fever was recently narrowly avoided in Italy. 11 To date, numerous relevant epidemiological, virological, and clinical data have been collected to identify the main features that could characterize an EID and help to fight against it. Nevertheless, whatever the availability of scientific knowledge and the quality of its implementation into public health programmes, successful response rests, to a large extent, on the relevance of the behaviours adopted by the exposed populations. In other words, the more accurately the public evaluates the risk and complies with public health recommendations, the smaller the amplitude of the epidemic and its harmful consequences tend to be. From this perspective, understanding how and why the public perceives and reacts to the threat of an EIDFwhat determines the pattern and distribution of protective behavioursF represents one of the most crucial challenges both in terms of scientific knowledge and in terms of health and socioeconomic impacts.",16.51487683364501,5.247392107427742

Although introduced relatively recently, SILAC has been used extensively in the proteomics community [14] . With SILAC, the entire proteome of a given cell population is metabolically labeled by heavy, non-radioactive isotopic variants of amino acids, thus making it distinguishable by MS analysis [15, 16] . Thereafter, two or more distinctly SILAC-labeled cell populations can be mixed and analyzed in one MS experiment, allowing accurate quantization of proteins from the different cellular states.

When the combination scheme is employed, those testing negative to the rapid diagnostic test following quarantine of length t would be the population of interest, as they are then released into the community. Let p be the prevalence level at the source (0 ≤ p ≤ 1). Among infected individuals (who account for 100p% of the travellers), the fraction of those who are detected or lose infectiousness following quarantine of length t (i.e., true positives) is (1-r 1 (t)). Of the remaining infected individuals r 1 (t), the fraction of those testing positive, S e r 1 (t), to the rapid diagnostic test are placed into isolation and, thus, are added to the true positives. Consequently, the remaining fraction (1-S e )r 1 (t) are false negatives and are released into the community ( Figure 1 ). Among uninfected individuals (i.e., 100(1-p)% of the travellers), the length of quarantine does not influence the preventive performance (because they are not infected and their quarantine is irrelevant to the loss of infectiousness). Thus, among the total number of incoming travellers, the fractions (1-p)(1-S p ) and (1-p)S p will be testing positive (false positives) and negative (true negatives), respectively, to the rapid diagnostic test. Consequently, positive predictive value (PPV) of quarantine combined with rapid diagnostic testing is whereas negative predictive value (NPV) is PPV measures the preventive performance of quarantine policy to correctly place infected individuals in quarantine (or isolation) during their infectious period (i.e., how efficiently are we placing infectious individuals in the quarantine facility, among a total of those who are diagnosed as positive either by quarantine of length t or rapid diagnostic testing). NPV measures the preventive performance of the release policy (i.e., how large is the fraction of true negatives among a total of those who are diagnosed as negative after the quarantine of length t and rapid diagnostic testing). We numerically computed both PPV and NPV for different prevalence levels (from 0-15%) and different lengths of quarantine (from 0 to 10 days). All analyses were made using the statistical software JMP ver. 7.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Figure 2 shows density functions of the incubation period and generation time. The incubation period was similar to those reported previously [12, 27, 28] . Mean and variance of the incubation period were estimated as 1. 43 Figure 3 shows the estimated effectiveness of quarantine as a function of time since infection (i.e., time since arrival). A different effectiveness measure (i.e., relative reduction of the risk of releasing ""symptomatic infected"" individuals regardless of infectiousness) is shown (dashed line) comparatively with the other two results showing the relative reduction of the risk of releasing ""infectious"" individuals in the presence and absence of the use of rapid diagnostic testing (thin and thick solid lines, respectively). It should be noted that the reduction of symptomatic infected individuals is based only on the incubation period, measuring a different concept of effectiveness from other two. The incubation period alone suggests that 95% effectiveness in preventing the release of symptomatic infected individuals is achieved by quarantine of 2.73 days.",24.299267878647242,14.103443517963544

The shortest length, 2.8 days, was suggested by the incubation period as being 95% effective in preventing the release of symptomatic infected individuals into the community. Two of the others (4.8 and 8.7 days) corresponded to 95% and 99% effectiveness in preventing release of infectious individuals by means of quarantine alone, and 5.7 days corresponded to 99% effectiveness when quarantine was combined with rapid diagnostic testing. Figure 4 shows the median (and 5-95th percentile) numbers of infectious individuals who are released into the community after quarantine of specified lengths. The quarantine for 2.8 days could miss as many as 11 (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) , 56 (45-68) and 114 (92-129) infectious cases for the prevalence of 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively in the 8000 arriving travellers considered. However, these misses were reduced to 4 (1-7), 20 (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) and 39 cases by the quarantine of length 4.8 days, to 3 (0-5), 13 (7-19) and 27 (16-36) by 5.7 days and, moreover, to 1 (0-2), 4 (1-8) and 8 (4-13) cases by 8.7 days. The additional diagnostic testing could greatly reduce the released number of infectious individuals ( Figure 4B ). For the quarantine lengths of 2.8 and 5.7 days with rapid diagnostic testing, 3 (1-7), 18 (10-25) and 34 cases and 1 (0-2), 4 (1-8) and 8 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) cases, respectively, were expected be released into the community for the prevalence of 1%, 5% and 10%. All values for the quarantine period of 5.7 days combined with use of a diagnostic test were less than 3% of the total number of incoming infected individuals. Figure 5 describes the ripple benefit of quarantine, expressed as the number of secondary transmissions caused by released infectious individuals. The qualitative patterns found were similar to those of Figure 4 , but it should be noted that no secondary transmission was observed in the community in several scenarios. Quarantine of length 2.8 days, with or without rapid diagnostic testing, would lead to many secondary transmissions caused by released infectious individuals. When there was quarantine of 4.8 days without rapid diagnostic testing, we found 0 (0-2), 3 (1-7) and 5 (1-11) secondary transmissions. Extending quarantine to 8.7 days resulted in no secondary transmissions at prevalence levels of 1%, 5% and 10% (i.e., all were 0 except for 1 secondary transmission at the 95th percentile for all three prevalence levels). When diagnostic testing was combined with the quarantine period for 5.7 days, 0 (0-1), 0 (0-1) and 0 (0-2) secondary transmissions resulted. That is, even though quarantine alone for 8.7 days and quarantine combined with diagnostic testing for 5.7 days permit the release of several infectious individuals (up to 3% of the total number of incoming infected passengers), the majority of the released cases are at the late stage of infection and hardly cause secondary transmissions in the island nation (i.e. even in the worst case, only a few secondary transmissions would be expected). Figure 6 shows contour plots of PPV and NPV of quarantine combined with rapid diagnostic testing as functions of the length of quarantine and prevalence of influenza at the source. Given a fixed prevalence, PPV was greater for shorter length of quarantine (especially, for t < 1 day) due mainly to the relative increase in detection of true positives by rapid diagnostic testing (see equation (6)). However, it became less sensitive to the length of quarantine as the length became longer (for t > 2 days) and depended",24.700225219527056,12.952209688116817

Preventive performance in finding true positives (i.e., PPV of quarantine combined with rapid diagnostic testing) appeared not to be very sensitive to the length of quarantine (for t > 2 days). This result suggests that if diagnostic test kit supplies are plentiful, then testing should be done early in quarantine. But if a test kit sparing approach is used (i.e., avoiding testing of those who become symptomatic) then there is not much benefit in delaying testing until after day 2 in quarantine. A test with both high sensitivity and high specificity would also allow for better use of resources if the travellers who tested negative are released into the community. Since PPV is mainly determined by prevalence at the source, it should be noted that an exit screening process at the source lowers the prevalence as well as PPV. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of quarantine itself is independent of the prevalence, and moreover, lower prevalence among incoming individuals yields a higher chance of extinction (or greater ripple effect of quarantine (Figures 4 and 5) ). NPV of quarantine combined with diagnostic testing would be extremely high with quarantine periods for lengths of 3 days or longer, supporting our suggestion to release quarantined individuals testing negative to the rapid diagnostic test into the community (if there was high confidence in test performance parameters for the emergent pandemic strain). In light of our findings, island countries may consider including influenza testing capacity and test kit stockpiles in their pandemic plans. The use of rapid diagnostic tests, if available through stockpiling in advance or rapid delivery after pandemic emergence, may permit more effective border control, with more efficient use of isolation facilities and shortening of the quarantine period.",21.871651318841025,10.90484736314465

Access to decentralized molecular diagnostic testing can enable faster diagnostics, treatments, and subsequent control of infectious diseases. A critical challenge to efforts in decentralizing molecular diagnostic testing is that a large segment of the population in need of these advances resides in low-resource settings (LRS) that offer extremely limited laboratory infrastructure [3, 4] . While many well-characterized molecular assays have been developed around polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [5, 6] , including pathogen and infectious disease detection [7] [8] [9] , food and water safety [10] [11] [12] , forensics [13, 14] , population-scale polymorphisms [15, 16] , and mutation studies [17] , it remains largely a laboratory technique requiring expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus, PCR-based devices for molecular diagnostics have not been appropriately commercialized for geographical areas and demographics that would benefit most from the technology. Besides the cost and temperature-sensitivity of reagents, thermal cyclers are generally much too expensive to be purchased for users in these areas. In addition, the timescales required to perform a typical PCR remain slow, generally about an hour or more. This is partially due to the large thermal masses of most commercial thermal cyclers that make the process very inefficient.

Instead, mammalian expression systems have been the traditional approach for the large-scale manufacture of therapeutic proteins which require these critical post-translational modifications. An additional advantage of these mammalian cell systems is that the recombinant proteins are secreted into the media in their natural form. E. coli-expressed proteins, on the other hand, mostly accumulate in a highly denatured form within the cell as inclusion bodies and require renaturation later in the manufacturing process [2] . About 60-70% of all recombinant protein therapeutics are produced in mammalian cells, primarily Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [3] . CHO cells have many characteristics that have made them the most widely used mammalian host system. In addition to ease of manipulation and other characteristics preferred for large-scale production of proteins, proteins produced in CHO cells have a proven safety profile in humans and these proteins also have glycosylation patterns similar to that of human proteins [4] .Advances in modulating the glycosylation patterns of some yeast strains (e.g., P. pastoris) may lead to an alternative, nonmammalian cell system in the future [5] but currently, mammalian cells remain the primary vehicle for large-scale production of recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins.",17.74680134992699,10.806033351712575

As we progress through the 21 st century, it is possible that these techniques will replace conventional tests (Box 1). Obstacles to adoption include cost, complexity and local acceptance of their use. It is also possible that immunological tests by measuring 'indirect' markers such as cytokines and electrolytes will increase in use. These tests however, will probably remain in the realm of large reference laboratories where resources allow the development of novel assays. As far as semi-automated or automated instruments and robotics-based techniques are concerned, they are useful when large numbers of the same test are undertaken such as surveillance and companion animal testing and these tests will continue to increase in popularity and use, especially in central reference facilities. There is a clear need to simplify molecular diagnostic techniques so these tests can be applied universally in developing and developed countries. It is likely that new developments will focus on generating low volume and yet affordable diagnostic tests for rabies. More use will be made of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic testing using portable extraction techniques linked to PCR machines with the use of lyophilised reagents to overcome coldchain dependencies in tropical countries. In the 21 st century, these technologies will have a demonstrable impact on people living in developing countries, especially where rabies is still considered a 'neglected' disease. By contrast in the developed world, these new technological advances will undoubtedly be faster, more accurate and cost-effective leading to a 'Theragnostics Approach' that combines therapeutics with diagnostics for the human treatment of rabies. Interest in treating human rabies aggressively is gaining momentum, largely due to the reported success in treating a 15year-old girl, in whom clinical rabies developed one month after she was bitten by a bat, using a combination of therapeutic coma with antiviral drugs whilst allowing for the host immune system to confer immunity -The 'Milwaukee Protocol' (Box 2) [62, 63] . Bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics, and functional genomics are the molecular biology tools that are essential for the progress of molecular 'theragnostics', where both early diagnosis and monitoring of serology are critical factors for the successful treatment of a rabies patient. In addition, theragnostics could eliminate the unnecessary treatment of patients for whom rabies immunotherapy is not appropriate i.e. immunosuppressed patients, resulting in substantial drug cost savings for the healthcare system.",21.783560067540012,11.974556134684843

Simple deletion or overexpression of an uncharacterized gene often fails to yield any discernible phenotype in standard laboratory contexts. In the same vein, a purely biochemical approach that relies on purification and in vitro biochemical characterization of uncharacterized genes often fails to yield fruitful functional data. Furthermore, while sequence-based bioinformatic analyses and computational models may provide clues about functional genetic interactions, such predictions are often limited by our current biological knowledge and databases. As a consequence, functional annotation is incorrect in many cases because unvalidated information is propagated across species. In cases where gene function is experimentally assigned and validated, the information is often not broadly propagated or may not apply to another organism. Therefore, a successful functional annotation endeavor requires a multipronged approach that involves open collaboration among scientists with expertise in genetics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell physiology, host-microbe interactions, and data management. Such a program is outside the scope of traditional funding mech- anisms and requires integrated teams of experts and new highthroughput experimental methodologies. The NIAID has implemented a program aimed at assigning functions to open reading frames (ORFs) and small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that have been discovered by large-scale sequencing efforts to begin addressing this gap in our understanding of bacterial and viral gene function. This timely initiative from the NIAID is highly significant because it is the institute's first attempt to incorporate functional annotation into its genomics and advanced technologies program, which is focused on developing genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics resources to advance our understanding of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID Functional Genomics (FG) program builds on previous functional annotation efforts, such as COMBREX (2) , and brings together multidisciplinary groups to work on shared goals. Its mission is to probe new biology in pathogenic bacteria and viruses by assigning functions to new genes. The FG program is unique in its approach in that it enables principal investigators to follow up on ""omics"" and phenotypic screening data with targeted experiments to establish gene function. Most pathogens are evolving constantly, and such an integrated approach will provide the database to allow us to work toward predicting new emerging infectious diseases and respond to new pandemics.",20.483303003993388,10.465931583166483

Accumulated evidence indicates that this large-scale outbreak of diarrhea were caused by highly virulent PEDV variants [17, 18] . Serological assays can quickly detect large numbers of samples with both high sensitivity and specificity. Several indirect ELISA have been developed based on either whole PEDV preparations or recombinant viral proteins [19] [20] [21] . The S protein of PEDV has numerous epitopes and highly antigenic index regions that induce the production of neutralizing antibodies [10, 22, 23] , and anti-S antibodies detected in PEDV-infected pigs persist longer than anti-N antibodies [11] , thus, we choose S protein as the diagnostic antigen. The recombinant S1 protein was applied to establish an indirect ELISA, and its reaction conditions were optimized. As PEDV is an enteric virus, it directly infects and damages enterocytes. Mucosal IgA, but not systemic IgG, plays a crucial role in protection [24, 25] . In this research, the titers of IgA in the serum were tested for serological evaluation and indirect diagnosis of PEDV infection. Of the 1125 serum samples which were PEDV exposed, the overall positive rate of the antibody is 91.29%, which were varied from 78 to 100% between 10 farms. Of the 482 serum samples which were PEDV non-exposed, the overall positive rate of the antibody is 6.43%, which were varied from 5.1 to 7.8% between 5 farms. The evaluated ELISA presented an overall substantial agreement on the PEDV infection status of the field swine serum samples. The intra-and inter-assay variability tests proved that this ELISA method had good repeatability.

Further, the overall rate of coincidence of this ELISA was calculated at 96.74% compared with IFA, proving that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of this ELISA method were favorable.",18.82303689230489,11.52840921290867

We have shown that TGC-NGS assays can function as broad multiplex pathogen detection assays for animal pathogens. We also demonstrated that hybridization to targeted capture probes can enrich pathogen nucleic acids up to 56 millionfold relative to host genes and that full genome sequences were retrieved from both clinical and experimental samples from three different host species. A significant number of pathogens were identified that were not readily detected using more traditional veterinary diagnostic technologies, and we documented that bioinformatics analysis alone was not sufficient to detect pathogens from unenriched samples. We identified the limitations of this technology related to very low starting pathogen concentrations and poor sample quality. Optimizing capture probes and implementing stringent quality control measures prior to NGS could enhance the utility of this technology for large-scale diagnostic use. We also recognize that while promising, NGS-based assays such as those described here require more investigation before they can be used in place of traditional diagnostic procedures, and therefore we recommend that laboratories adopting NGS-based assays do so alongside traditional methods until protocols are fully validated.",16.786542081044104,9.134371556959644

The development of a collection of C. albicans constitutive or conditional overexpression strains is one of the applications of the C. albicans ORFeome that we have successfully explored (12, 32, 57) . In this respect, the C. albicans ORFeome project is currently completing its second and third phases, which consist of transferring the 5099 cloned ORFs into barcoded destination vectors and generating a collection of C. albicans barcoded overexpression mutants, each mutant carrying one of the 5099 cloned ORFs under the control of the inducible P TET promoter. CandidaOrfDB already provides information on the available overexpression plasmids and strains. In this study, we have paved the way for a second application of the C. albicans ORFeome through the development of tools for a 2H matrix approach of proteinprotein interaction detection via mating in C. albicans. Our data show that mating of diploid C. albicans expressing a bait fused to the LexA DNA binding domain and a prey fused to the VP16 activation domain, respectively, allows protein-protein interactions to be tested. In S. cerevisiae, large-scale 2H screens can be performed in a matrix design whereby haploid strains expressing baits and preys are mated and protein-protein interactions are scored in the resulting diploids. Our toolkit now enables the implementation of such a matrix design for large-scale 2H screens in C. albicans. To this aim, a collection of 1500 prey clones has already been generated. As mentioned above, C. albicans codon usage is unusual, which limits the development of applications of the C. albicans ORFeome in species that use standard decoding such as S. cerevisiae. Our development of tools for large-scale 2H screens in C. albicans circumvents this limitation, opening the path for the characterization of the C. albicans interactome. Defining the C. albicans interactome will undoubtedly impact our understanding of C. albicans pathogenesis in humans.",17.582938312596237,7.514981406616324

However, antiviral drugs are not completely harmless, and the conditions under which individuals are willing to participate in a large-scale antiviral drug treatment program are as yet unknown. We provide population dynamical and game theoretical analyses of large-scale prophylactic antiviral treatment programs. Throughout we compare the antiviral control strategy that is optimal from the public health perspective with the control strategy that would evolve if individuals make their own, rational decisions. To this end we investigate the conditions under which a large-scale antiviral control program can prevent an epidemic, and we analyze at what point in an unfolding epidemic the risk of infection starts to outweigh the cost of antiviral treatment. This enables investigation of how the optimal control strategy is moulded by the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the risk of mortality by antiviral prophylaxis, and the transmissibility of the pathogen. Our analyses show that there can be a strong incentive for an individual to take less antiviral drugs than is optimal from the public health perspective. In particular, when public health asks for early and aggressive control to prevent or curb an emerging pathogen, for the individual antiviral drug treatment is attractive only when the risk of infection has become non-negligible. It is even possible that from a public health perspective a situation in which everybody takes antiviral drugs is optimal, while the process of individual choice leads to a situation where nobody is willing to take antiviral drugs.",17.384499854555095,12.220605980702864

(i) Large-scale custom DNA synthesis (and new genomeassembly techniques) combined with knowledge from functional genomics on pathogens might facilitate the generation and malicious use of new pathogens by both nation states and non-state actors (e.g. rogue individuals or terrorist groups). Various governance options have been suggested both within and outside the field, concerning screening procedures for DNA synthesis, its equipment and reagents, or ethical training of researchers (for recent overviews, see [20, 144] ). Though much biotechnology knowledge and expertise has likely already proliferated globally [144] , recent studies into various assessments on bioscience research and bioterrorism suggest that the attractiveness and feasibility of ""synthetic"" solutions for bioterrorist use may have to be reconsidered, especially when compared to available ""low-tech"" solutions [144, 145] . Still recent experiments, involving directed evolution and genetic-engineering, into the airborne transmission of the deadly bird-flu virus H5N1 in ferrets (a model to study influenza transmission in humans) [146, 147] have revigorated debates about conditions for publication of biosecurity-sensitive data [148] . (ii) As regards the other threat that is more specifically linked to the onset of synthetic biology, it may become more difficult, or even impossible, to assess the risks of extensively genetically modified or (putative) entirely ""synthetic"" future organisms, based on similarities with donor and recipient organisms. This issue may become more significant as the areas of synthetic genomics and synthetic biology progress and it remains to be seen whether synthetic biology-derived containment strategies (including xenobiotic mechanisms) can contribute to solve biosafety issues in future.

However, this line of reasoning may be inaccurate.

Our analyses show that over the course of an epidemic the death toll can be considerable if no antiviral drugs are taken, and that the number of deaths is orders of magnitudes smaller if a large-scale antiviral control program is effective ( Figure 2) . However, the analyses also show that in an epidemic that is effectively controlled by a large-scale antiviral treatment program the majority of deaths result from the use of antiviral drugs. The intuitive explanation is that although the hazard of mortality by antiviral prophylaxis is small on the short-term individual level, the total death toll may be quite high as the number of individuals that must receive antiviral drugs for an effective control effort is probably on the order of total population size.

Immunity can be acquired through infection at a young age (natural immunity) or vaccination (artificial immunity). Natural immunity is currently difficult to acquire in Korea and the recent implementation of mandatory infant vaccination under the NIP leaves the challenge of increasing immunity in adults [24] . However, it is practically difficult to administer the hepatitis A vaccine to all individuals. Therefore, all three policies should be deployed to prevent hepatitis A outbreaks. Which policy will be conducted as a priority will depend on the circumstances in each country. Immunization policies, in particular, depend on the hepatitis A incidence rate in each country. The World Health Organization recommends vaccination of individuals in countries with very low incidence of hepatitis A and rare outbreaks who are at high risk of hepatitis A infection (i.e., those travelling in high-prevalence regions, hemophiliacs, male homosexuals, those with illegal drug abuse, and jobs in contact with primates) [25] . In countries with a high incidence of hepatitis A, large-scale vaccination is not recommended as it will have little effect since many people tend to be infected when they are young and acquire natural immunity. However, large-scale vaccination is a cost-effective measure in countries, such as Korea, with large differences in immunity levels by age and region due to reduction in hepatitis A incidence [25] . The immunity levels are relatively low among Koreans born in the 1970s to 1990s and even lower in urban areas. In addition, the incidence, and complication and mortality rates of hepatitis A increase with age; thus, the hepatitis A fatality rate may increase in future outbreaks. Therefore, a large-scale catch-up vaccination policy is required for adults in their 20s to 40s. The hurdles to the introduction of such a policy, including securing budgets, vaccine supply, and low vaccination rates, can be overcome if with the establishment and implementation of a long-term plan of five years or more. As a short-term measure, organizations such as public health centers should provide adult vaccines at a lower cost than that of private hospitals to provide an alternative for those who are not vaccinated due to cost.",16.16535221098549,10.130556775088511

In a study conducted by Payne and Puumala, no racial or ethnic disparities were found among pediatric patients who presented with head injuries, for which a head injury algorithm was used. 5 Even though differences were not observed, there is insufficient evidence to show that evidence-based guidelines actually reduce disparities among children. Adherence to guidelines may not produce any change (if all patients benefit irrespective of racial, ethnic, or language background) or may even worsen disparities, as shown in some adult studies. 30 It is important to note that the differences found in our study were only among diagnostic testing, which would only be mediated by a diagnosis-based guideline. However, there is some rationale that focusing on the development and implementation of comprehensive equityfocused guidelines may be a way to facilitate the reduction of disparities among diagnostic testing, interventions, and health outcomes. Welch et al discussed the necessity of explicitly considering health equity in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology, and developed an approach for how guideline panels can assess the influence of equity factors on the direction and strength of recommendations. 31−33 For instance, openly asking questions about biases and researching the evidence regarding which populations are potentially disadvantaged in relation to a clinical problem and why (because of race, gender, culture, language, etc.) can help directly inform clinical practice guidelines. Although other frameworks (such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines used in the United Kingdom) explicitly identify certain patient characteristics that must be considered in guideline development, only recently has health equity been included in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework as a consideration for clinical recommendations from an individual perspective. Thus, clinical practice guidelines may contribute to promoting health equity especially when the etiologies of the clinically relevant disparities are thoroughly explored. 31 ",18.03487749761146,10.731430683066751

Figure 9 shows 5 typical transferring processes (Type A, Type B, Type C, Type D and Type E) of a MFP released at source S3 near the aisle region for 40 s. Figure 9 (a) shows Type A: a MFP released at source S3, going along with the large-scale vortex at the same side of the cabin, and finally exhausting through outlet. Type A is mainly dominated by the largescale vortex in the same side of source S3. For Type A, passengers of A, B and C are potentially at risk of being affected by the MFP released at S3. Figure 9 (b) shows Type B: a MFP released at source S3, going across the aisle region, then going along with the large-scale vortex at opposite side of source S3, and finally exhausting through outlet.

In Type C, the MFP goes across the aisle region at least once and goes along both large-scale vortices in the two sides of the cabin. All passengers in the fourth row are potentially at risk of being affected by MFP released at S3. As shown in Fig. 9(d) , in Type D, MFPs are transmitted out of the fourth row. Passengers seated in adjacent rows are potentially at risk of being affected by MFPs released at S3. This can be explained by the fact that longitudinal airflow inevitably exists within aircraft cabins, and contributes to the transmission of MFPs in the longitudinal direction.

Compared to the mean and root mean squares of velocity field, instantaneous velocity field can provide real detailed airflow structures and time evolution of instantaneous airflow patterns within aircraft cabin. This information is very important to understand the mechanism of the velocity field's continuing high unsteadiness and contaminant transmission within this aircraft cabin. The conclusion is as follows: 1) Instantaneous airflow within this cabin mock-up is inherently unstable, which characterizes this type of flow regime and geometry. Velocity field within this single-aisle cabin mock-up is both temporally and spatially unstable. A sufficient small perturbation could cause a series of complicated airflow bifurcations. The Peixoto theorem can be used to interpret this airflow instability. 2) Unstable instantaneous airflow within this single aircraft cabin has tremendous impact on MFP transmission.

Indeed, by the mid-1990s only the largest diagnostic laboratories had adopted such methods, and even then applications were often limited to niche areas such as the detection of viroids or phytoplasmas. The reasons for the slow uptake were many and varied, but were predominantly related to the practicality of performing molecular tests, especially PCR. Specific problems included cross-contamination, interpretation of results, extraction reliability, and the high labourrequirements of testing large numbers of samples. At this time it became clear that if molecular diagnostics were to become more widely adopted, then much more effort was required to address the practical issues related to performing molecular assays, rather than focussing almost exclusively on the specificity and sensitivity of such tests, as had previously occurred.

Such motions may be reduced or eliminated by redesign of the protein construct (for instance, to remove disor-dered terminal extensions) or by binding to a ''crystallization chaperone'' which might be as large as an antibody fragment (Iwata et al., 1995) or as small as a chemical inhibitor (Ren et al., 1995) .

Evolutionary biologists from diverse disciplinary backgrounds (e.g., Dobzhansky, Simpson, Mayr, Eldredge, Gould, Gingerich, Futuyma, and Orr) have, like most scientists, recognized that large-scale evolutionary trends, extinctions, and originations of higher taxa do in fact appear in the fossil record (e.g., Simpson 1953 ; Futuyma 2005 ; Coyne and Orr 1998 ; Erwin 2010 ) . But these and many other authors have disagreed about whether microevolutionary processes (such as natural selection and genetic drift) are capable of suffi ciently accounting for such well-established large-scale patterns (Gould 1985 ) . Causal pluralism, or the expansion of explanatory mechanisms beyond natural selection, is thus a key topic of attention in HPS perspectives on macroevolution. Such plurality is also historically important, as it is considered by some to be divergent from the views of Darwin ( 1859 ) , who proposed ""…natural selection as the single unifying mechanism that causes both micro-and macroevolution"" (Travis and Reznick 2009 , p. 126) .",21.345191600462833,10.645939511944217

However, few largescale epidemiological studies have utilized the SCID as a diagnostic tool on a global scale. Different from the WHO MH-CIDI, the SCID was designed to be administered by a clinician or trained mental health professional, which can be very costly. In fact, so far only large-scale epidemiological studies conducted in China (Phillips et al., 2009 ) have used the SCID as an assessment tool. Two major differences between those by Phillips et al. (2009) and the current one are worth pointing out: First, the studies by Phillips et al. (2009) involved a two-stage screening process. In the first stage all subjects were screened with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and classified into three risk strata for mental disorder, and in the second-stage all high-risk respondents and a random selection of moderate or low risk respondents were assigned to complete the diagnostic assessment using the SCID. Second, only less than one third (28%) of the study subjects completed the assessment with the SCID. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first large-scale representative community epidemiological survey in which all respondents were screened using a one-stage investigation method with the SCID performed by mental health professionals. These are the most notable strengths of this study. Another strength of this study was the sampling design: we adopted the cluster stratified random sampling method. The basic sampling unit was the household with all eligible members being included, rather than specific individuals from every household. This method avoided the random selection of others in the absence of the initially selected resident within each household, and decreased possible selection bias.",19.006502424104944,12.38225710396804

For any given analyte, there are a number of highly sensitive and specific tests available from which to choose. Considerations that go into the selection of a test or instrument platform for implementation include perceived turnaround time needs for improved patient care, sample volume requirements, number of tests expected, suitability for the intended laboratory based on available expertise and desired workflow, as well as cost.",19.27011789041856,10.555735908004987

MS is easily adaptable to different scales of detection and applicable for low-, medium-and high-throughput clinical screening and diagnostic testing [10] . Sub-picomolar amounts of the analyte can be detected without fluorescence or radioactive isotope labeling or using antibodies or hybridization probes. It can be used to detect the material of interest directly [11] or after attaching an intermediate detector molecule, thus conferring high sensitivity to detection [12] . Direct detection significantly simplifies the MS diagnostic applications [10, 13] . As a detection system for NAs, MS can be easily coupled with any widely available DNA amplification technique. These qualities, combined with the capability of multiplexing -that is, testing for different analytes at the same time -make MS particularly suitable for rapid molecular diagnostics in the clinical setting. MS is uniquely suited for supporting multiple diverse applications. The throughput and multiplexing capacity of MS help reduce the cost of testing.",17.188369637236317,10.021906252629421

[2] [3] Diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses is usually performed in hospital settings. Testing serves several functions, including facilitating patient cohorting, 4 initiation of antiviral therapy, 5 containment of nosocomial outbreaks, 6 and decreased use of ancillary testing [7] [8] and antibiotics. [8] [9] [10] In most cases, respiratory samples are collected by invasive methods such as nasopharyngeal swab or nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and diagnostics are performed using immunofluorescence and/or culture-based methods. 11 Increased sensitivity has been demonstrated with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), [12] [13] and the use of PCR diagnostics in hospitals has increased. 11 Diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses is also important for surveillance and epidemiologic studies performed in both hospital and community settings. Throughout the year, multiple respiratory viruses co-circulate and can cause similar clinical syndromes that cannot be distinguished without diagnostic testing. [14] [15] Recent studies of nonpharmaceutical interventions to prevent the spread of influenza have highlighted the need for large-scale, community-based epidemiologic data, including specific laboratoryconfirmed diagnosis. 16 PCR-based methods have enabled investigators to perform familybased studies of viral prevalence in the community. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Invasive respiratory sample collection methods for respiratory testing have significant limitations for community studies. 22 The performance of a nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab test is stressful, leading to reluctance among children and parents to participate in studies, particularly if repeated testing is required. Based on the higher sensitivity of PCR, we hypothesized that respiratory viruses could be detected from samples collected by noninvasive methods that might be more acceptable to children such as anterior nare swabs or facial tissues. While other studies have investigated the use of anterior nare swabs to collect samples for the detection of respiratory viruses, 23-28 studies investigating the use of facial tissues have not been published.",24.8552552092717,9.65776643504958

With the progress in manufacturing of filters with smaller and smaller pores, virus filtration has become a universal key process in assuring pathogen safety-size matters only.

However, the location of fugitive particles shown in Fig. 8 corresponded to the location where a large eddy circulated near the ceiling.

If the laboratory receives a large number of specimens and has previous experience with EIAs, then biotin-EIAs or TR-FIAs may be the most practical techniques. Their advantages include the stability of the antigens in clinical samples since intact, exfoliated epithelial cells are not required, treatment of specimens is practical, testing of large numbers of specimens is possible, and reading the printed test result is less subjective than reading fluorescence microscopy.

The ability to prepare adequately depends on the nature of the crisis situation. Preparation presumes the ability of foresight and prediction. In the case of small-scale disasters, emergency agencies can rely on protocols, network infrastructures and professional, highly trained teams ready to respond [24] . With large scale, unprecedented disasters the required response exceeds beyond the control and capabilities of one or more emergency agencies. A response organization still has to be created in the terms of a series of interlocking routines, habituated action patterns that bring the same people together around the same activities in the same time and places [85, 87] . Prediction and preparation become difficult because of low probability and the complex nature of the tasks that must be carried to control the crisis [73] . Most large scale disasters are the result of separate, small events that become linked in unpredictable ways. The more tightly activities are coupled the less linear they become [58, 68] . During the preparation phase (which in fact can be considered a 'phase' only after the crisis happens), most tasks are loosely formulated and ill-defined. They are directed to possibly conflicting ends, while missing unequivocal criteria for deciding when and how objectives are to be achieved. Turner [73] argues that in those situations problems are often solved by creating 'small areas of certainty' which can be handled. Another frequently used solution is to simplify the assumption of the complex environment, thus allowing for an oversimplified set of actions. This could lead to a situation in which crisis managers assume they control the crisis while they are in fact fighting only a small part of it. In fact, through inadequate sensemaking of the environment [84] they may even contribute the crisis spinning out of control.",16.927859145811325,8.354432359778777

However, not all diagnostic tests fi nd their way to application in health care. For some, clinical utility may not be demonstrated due to the lack of an actionable result, cost-effectiveness, high-throughput methods, or adequate reimbursement. For example, early asymptomatic glaucoma testing was widely abandoned because early detection did not affect the outcome. Other tests may not achieve the analytical performance characteristics required of a good diagnostic. Assay sensitivity, specifi city, and predictive value must be high (Gaeta, 2005 ) . Reproducible precision and a clinically reportable range must be demonstrated ( Irwig, et al., 2002 ) .

The results from small and largescale growth also vary owing to differences in sample preparation and protein purification methods that are used for each scale of growth. Therefore, whereas positive small-scale experiments are often predictive of the results from large-scale growth, there will inevitably be a substantial proportion of false negatives in which an apparently nonexpressed or insoluble protein can be in fact, expressed in soluble form when grown on a larger scale.

Making this goal a reality, however, was not to be achieved by relying on large-scale automation but rather on process integration and miniaturization driven largely by advances in engineering guided by the diagnostic needs of physicians and patients. Specifically, advances in microfluidics and microscale automation made it possible to fully integrate, on a handheld scale, the previously segmented processes of nucleic acid extraction and purification, PCR amplification, amplicon detection, and even such complex tasks as electrophoretic size fractionation. With miniaturization also came the ability to reduce processing times so as produce answers more quickly.

Avian influenza is a significant global human health threat because of its potential to infect humans and result in a global influenza pandemic. However, very little sequence information for avian influenza virus (AIV) has been in the public domain. A more comprehensive collection of publicly available sequence data for AIV is necessary for research on influenza to understand how flu evolves, spreads, and causes disease, to shed light on the emergence of influenza epidemics and pandemics, and to uncover new targets for drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. In this study, the investigators released genomic data from the first large-scale sequencing of AIV isolates, doubling the amount of AIV sequence data in the public domain. These sequence data include 2,196 AIV genes and 169 complete genomes from a diverse sample of birds. The preliminary analysis of these sequences, along with other AIV data from the public domain, revealed new information about AIV, including the identification of a genome sequence that may be a determinant of virulence.

Thus, incorporating local weather conditions into clinical decision-making ultimately might help increase or decrease clinical suspicion for LD, especially when combined with diagnostic testing. Current US CAP guidelines recommend empiric therapy routinely covering atypical pneumonias (29) . Results of a recent noninferiority trial suggest that monotherapy with a β-lactam, aggressive diagnostic testing, and use of clinical judgment may safely avert the use of fluoroquinolones or dual therapy with a macrolide in patients with CAP (10) . However, the same trial replicated elsewhere with a higher rate of LD might yield different results. Another study investigating the effect of a β-lactam alone versus a β-lactam with a macrolide found delays in clinical stability for persons treated with only 1 agent, but the authors failed to show that the β-lactam alone was not inferior (30) . Our model suggests that warm, humid, and rainy summer months in the Mid-Atlantic may exhibit predicted probabilities of LD of nearly 8%. Accordingly, abandoning initial empiric coverage for LD might yield a differential effect on outcomes depending on season, region, and weather, and treating all CAP cases for atypical pneumonia in areas and seasons when LD is relatively uncommon may result in the excessive use of antimicrobial agents.",17.66615335428916,8.570536401862611

The primary reason for such testing is if results will change the antibiotic management for an individual patient. The spectrum of antibiotic therapy can be broadened, narrowed, or completely altered on the basis of diagnostic testing. The alteration in therapy that is potentially most beneficial to the individual is an escalation or switch of the usual empirical regimen because of unusual pathogens (e.g., endemic fungi or Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or antibiotic resistance issues. Broad empirical coverage, such as that recommended in these guidelines, would not provide the optimal treatment for certain infections, such as psittacosis or tularemia. Increased mortality [80] and increased risk of clinical failure [81, 101] are more common with inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Management of initial antibiotic failure is greatly facilitated by an etiologic diagnosis at admission. De-escalation or narrowing of antibiotic therapy on the basis of diagnostic testing is less likely to decrease an in- dividual's risk of death but may decrease cost, drug adverse effects, and antibiotic resistance pressure. Some etiologic diagnoses have important epidemiologic implications, such as documentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, legionnaires disease, or agents of bioterrorism. Diagnostic testing for these infections may affect not only the individual but also many other people. Although pneumonia etiologies that should be reported to public health officials vary by state, in general, most states' health regulations require reporting of legionnaires disease, SARS, psittacosis, avian influenza (H5N1), and possible agents of bioterrorism (plague, tularemia, and anthrax). In addition, specific diagnostic testing and reporting are important for pneumonia cases of any etiology thought to be part of a cluster or caused by pathogens not endemic to the area.",23.823352949092367,13.45802429884111

In clinical practice, narrowing of antibiotic therapy is, unfortunately, unusual, but the committee strongly recommends this as best medical practice. The possibility of polymicrobial CAP and the potential benefit of combination therapy for bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia have complicated the decision to narrow antibiotic therapy. Delays in starting antibiotic therapy that result from the need to obtain specimens, complications of invasive diagnostic procedures, and unneeded antibiotic changes and additional testing for false-positive tests are also important considerations. The general recommendation of the committee is to strongly encourage diagnostic testing whenever the result is likely to change individual antibiotic management. For other patients with CAP, the recommendations for diagnostic testing focus on patients in whom the diagnostic yield is thought to be greatest. These 2 priorities often overlap. Recommendations for patients in whom routine diagnostic testing is indicated for the above reasons are listed in Retrospective studies of outpatient CAP management usually show that diagnostic tests to define an etiologic pathogen are infrequently performed, yet most patients do well with empir-ical antibiotic treatment [42, 106] . Exceptions to this general rule may apply to some pathogens important for epidemiologic reasons or management decisions. The availability of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, specific treatment and chemoprevention, and epidemiologic importance make influenza testing the most logical. Influenza is often suspected on the basis of typical symptoms during the proper season in the presence of an epidemic. However, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause a similar syndrome and often occurs in the same clinical scenario [107] . Rapid diagnostic tests may be indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain and when distinguishing influenza A from influenza B is important for therapeutic decisions.",21.961737233442907,10.01485473246872

SPINE (Structural Proteomics in Europe, an EU integrated project coordinated by D.I. Stuart, Oxford, UK) was the prototype of a large-scale, European structural proteomics project launched by the European Union in 2001. Amongst the eukaryotic targets, SPINE contained one workpackage dedicated to viral proteins. At that time, the frustration of virologists facing large-scale genomic projects originated from the small genome size of viruses. It was obvious that viruses of the Herpesviridae or Poxviridae could present respectable targets. The true innovation, however, came with the proposition that studying large families of related viruses could in fact address the well-known problem of poor crystallization success rate. For example, the structure of the first flavivirus polymerase, even from an obscure virus, would immediately have an impact on the whole flavivirus field. Additionally molecular replacement techniques would then considerably speed up the structure solu-tion of more medically important flavivirus polymerases once crystals became available. We also hoped that a gallery of structures from similar viruses would uncover small, as yet-unknown differences that could translate into larger in vivo differences, impacting for example on pathogenic properties, host range and mechanistics peculiarities. In fact, this approach had been met with partial success for RNA viruses. The main difficulties originated from the shortage of properly defined viral targets. In other words, at the time, it was a bit ambitious to start structural proteomics without addressing viral genomics. VIZIER, which started as an European FP6 Integrated Project in October 2004 with a 13 million D budget, specifically addressed this limitation by providing a comprehensive structural characterization of a diverse set of RNA viruses. In the meantime, a part of the efforts in the SPINE project were devoted to method developments, and technical progress implemented in the individual laboratories were combined. This study (published as special issue in Acta Crystallogaphica Section D, Volume 62, Part 10, October 2006) provided strategic information needed to set up a pipeline adapted for Structural and Functional Genomics of viral proteins involved in replication.",20.107362778671995,9.965738247922008

This was not only due to economic calculations (such as attracting foreign investments and sponsoring large infrastructure projects), but also to the need for parliamentary support from the powerful mining and agribusiness lobbies in the Brazilian Congress. As early as in 2003, the Ministry of the Environment was put under strong pressure from within the government itself to make several concessions. This was the case, for instance, regarding demands for more tolerance for transgenic soya and maize. As a result, the Ministry made these concessions, to the point of agreeing to an amnesty that benefitted large-scale farmers who had previously been involved in the illegal cultivation of genetically modified crops. The pressure from large-scale landowners culminated in the approval of the new Biosafety Law in 2005, which is overseen by the National Technical Biosafety Commission.

On the one hand, it can be argued that diagnostic testing falls within the research exemption, because patient blood or tissue sampling is often necessary to do research. On the other hand, it can be claimed that diagnostic testing can not fall within the exemption because once a diagnostic test is established, the act of diagnosis could be defined as and/or confined to the act of providing the referring medical doctor with an opinion as to whether or not the patient carries a deleterious mutation.

Modified mammalian cells are used for producing therapeutic proteins, which have the advantage of resulting in products that are similar to their natural counterparts. These cells can be cultured on a limited scale but production is quite expensive. Bacteria can be used for large-scale production of proteins, but the products differ from the natural products considerably. For example, the proteins that are usually glycosylated in humans are not glycosylated by bacteria.

Often this method is used for economic reasons; testing a large number of pooled specimens with one test is generally far cheaper than testing each animal individually. This is the case where the additional individual diagnostic test adds considerable cost, but the specimen is relatively cheap and readily available (e.g. milk). Pooled specimen testing is particularly useful as a screening test for the absence of disease or where disease prevalence is low. While pooling offers a method of investigating the disease status of a large population quickly (Lanyon et al., 2014a) , there are two points important to note. Firstly, when testing for the presence of a condition/factor or pathogen, pooling only makes sense if it makes testing more cost-effective or less time-consuming than individual testing. If the prevalence of the factor of interest is higher than the dilution factor caters for, all pools will be positive, and nothing has been gained. For example, if you pool 20 animals/ pool for BVDV virus testing and the disease prevalence in the population is 1-2%, 80% of pools are likely to screen negative, saving time and money. However, if you test 100 specimens/pool from the same population, all pools are likely to be positive, and you are no closer to identifying which animals are infected. By contrast, a run of 100 specimens is within the analytical capability of a PCR assay. Secondly, the diagnostic test also needs to possess sufficient analytical sensitivity to detect the antibody or antigen at the dilution factor determined by the degree of pooling. Usually an additional safety factor is added to ensure this. When testing for antibodies to EBL, the greatest dilution allowed for pooling is 10 times less than the highest dilution of a standard positive that can be detected e.g. if the standard can be detected diluted 1:100, pools of 10 animals each can be tested (Reichel et al., 1998) .",19.398448919237747,11.10765965307095

Currently available rapid antigen detection kits have not been validated for avian or pandemic influenza and are not recommended by the World Health Organization for avian or pandemic influenza diagnostics (http://www.who.int/ csr/disease/avian_influenza/guidelines/ labtestsMarch07web.pdf). Culture of all suspect pandemic isolates requires Containment Level (CL)-3 facilities which is not feasible in Ontario (few available approved facilities), whereas molecular methods can be performed in CL-2 facilities (http://www.searo.who.int/en/ Section10/Section1027/Section1091_4305 .htm). Molecular tools also allow for the characterization of difficult to culture strains (ProMed-Mail Archive # 20050509.1277) and the detection of drug-resistant viruses as they emerge. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] As of March 2007, OPHL verified a new automated real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for diagnosis of influenza A and B. This methodology allows for testing of large numbers of samples with a relatively short turnaround time when compared to culturebased diagnostic methods, 14 (Table II) . These data, and the results of an informal retrospective survey of employee opinion with respect to the concomitant increase in workload during that critical period, indicate that OPHL must develop a testing model and diagnostic capacity to deal with anticipated five-to tenfold surges in testing in the event of a pandemic. Other factors increasing the workload during a pandemic may include multiple sample submissions per patient, 16 and emergence of a pandemic influenza strain in a series of waves or at the same time as seasonal influenza. [17] [18] [19] [20] Why pandemic influenza testing was decentralized to four regions A decentralized testing plan will be effective because a pandemic strain may not affect all regions within a single jurisdiction at the same time. 5, 21, 22 To allow for increased testing capacity and capacity shifting between regions, four molecular diagnostics testing facilities have been created in the OPHL system from distinct regions in Ontario (i.e., Northwestern, Southwestern, Central and Eastern). A key goal is to decrease the transportation time from physicians in the regions to molecular testing facilities across the province. The number of sites was limited to four to prevent over-extension of resources in training of staff and validation of assays, and to limit the amount of work required to ensure competency for the Ontario Laboratory Accreditation (OLA) process. Other criteria for choosing the location of testing sites included accessibility to laboratory staff, proximity to ground and air transportation routes, ability of each individual laboratory to absorb molecular testing, and proximity to a centre of excellence (i.e., a University, College or other institution) for collaboration purposes and continued education of staff.",19.97203209304252,9.209777100942567

Laboratory information must therefore be accurate, reliable and reproducible. Although in some diagnostic questions rapid delivery of the test results is important, traditional centralised laboratories tend to highlight the quality and reliability of tests above the turn‐around‐time.3 For many diseases, care providers and patients increasingly expect patient‐focused, specialised diagnostic tests that can be performed quickly, easily and provide results within minutes.4 This has led to the development of easy‐to‐use analysers that can be performed at the point of care, more commonly known as point‐of‐care (POC) testing or near‐patient testing.1

Our study revealed that real-life diagnostic testing was not concordant with IDSA/ATS or ERS guidelines in the vast majority of the patients. Specifically, the discordance with the IDSA/ATS guidelines was mainly due to over-testing. This situation may be explained by the restrictive testing recommended by the IDSA/ATS guidelines. Of note, under-testing was also a cause of discordance with the IDSA/ATS guidelines and was more frequently encountered in North America than in Europe. Discordance with ERS guidelines was mainly due to under-testing, as a result of the extensive testing approach recommended by these guidelines. Over-testing was also identified as a cause of discordance with the ERS guidelines. This event was more frequently reported in Europe than in North America. We were intrigued by European clinicians’ extensive ordering of diagnostic tests, even beyond what is recommended by the ERS guidelines. Insurance and healthcare system-related factors may have shaped the diagnostic approach both of European and North American clinicians.

The method estimates the theoretical expected length of ORFs before a stop codon is reached in all reading frames within an established gene. If an ORF exists of much greater length than predicted by this expected length, then we surmise that there has been selection against the accumulation of stop codons that shorten the putative ORF. We conclude that this constitutes evidence that the ORF in question provides functional benefit to the virus. Despite its simplicity, we show that this method is a powerful way to detect functional overlapping genes that can be readily applied to large scale computational screening of all known viruses and to viruses newly discovered through metagenomics.",17.429566032685592,11.877039190579666

Unwanted splittings can be removed using constant time (CT) evolution (35–38), adiabatic band selective decoupling (39–41), or a series of selective pulses. Constant time evolution limits the acquisition time that can be used to obtain adequate resolution. To improve resolution requires long constant-time delays that lead to significant signal loss for large RNA molecules (41). Additionally, obtaining accurate relaxation parameters are problematic for 13C-CPMG based relaxation dispersion rates for quantifying millisecond (ms) time-scale processes, as well as R1 and proton–carbon hNOE (28,42) important for quantifying ns-ps time-scale motions in RNA (43,44). Several precautions are needed to obtain accurate R1 and R1ρ measurements (28,45–46): provided R1 is derived from the initial slope of the relaxation decay curve, fairly accurate rates can be extracted for small RNAs; for R1ρ experiments, distortions can arise from transfer between adjacent 13C atoms with similar chemical shifts via a Hartmann–Hahn mechanism and these need to be minimized (28,45–46); to suppress the echo-modulation caused by the large scalar couplings during the 13C relaxation delay, R1ρ can be measured instead of CPMG (28,47–49). Still for nucleic acids high power spinlocks (>1 kHz) are needed to study isolated spin pairs such as C2 found in adenine and C8 in both adenine and guanine. For low spin lock power levels (<1 kHz), oscillations can be observed in the monoexponential decay of peak intensity, arising from residual scalar coupling interactions within neighbouring nuclei (48,50–51).",13.227042077676252,9.733358019136915

This elegant spectroscopic solution has been exploited to measure nitrogen R1ρ in proteins and both carbon and nitrogen R1ρ in uniformly labeled nucleic acids (56–59). While this scheme obviates the need for selective 13C isotopic enrichment, in uniformly labeled samples, the presence of large homonuclear scalar couplings again limits the range of applicability of these methods (56,51). Finally building upon schemes for protein 15N and 13C CEST measurements by Kay and co-workers, Zhang et al. developed a set of nucleic-acid-optimized 1D/2D 13C CEST experiments that use various shaped pulses to refocus carbon–carbon scalar coupling and showed that accurate exchange parameters can be obtained for all CEST profiles in uniformly labeled RNA samples for purines and ribose carbons(34,60–62). Nonetheless, they and others acknowledged the following limitations for both CEST and R1ρ in uniformly labeled RNA and protein samples (33–34,60–63). First, the lowest spinlock or saturating B1 field that can be used is limited (∼3× the scalar coupling) to ∼45 Hz for Ade C2, ∼45 Hz for purine C8, ∼150 Hz for C1’. For pyrimidine ring carbons with large carbon-carbon couplings of ∼66 Hz, it would require ∼200 Hz spinlock fields for C5 and C6, clearly intractable with uniformly labeled samples. Second, even though 13C–13C couplings do not introduce errors in extracted chemical shifts for purines, these homonuclear couplings decrease the resolution. Ultimately, the coupling effects need to be considered in the CEST data analyses for couplings greater than 15 Hz. Otherwise, exchange parameters (kex) are overestimated and population ratios are underestimated (33). Thus, uniformly labeled samples do limit the range of wide applicability of both CEST and R1ρ to biological problems.",9.422533549098453,5.646217436621486

Additionally, these isolated spin pairs have facilitated the measurement of μs-ms dynamics using CPMG and CEST pulse sequences without the complications of large carbon-carbon couplings. Finally with these isolated ‘two-spin’ labels, these couplings need not be explicitly taken into account in the data analysis of CEST profiles as required in previous studies using uniformly labeled RNA or protein (33,34), but also be able to probe more useful sites such as pyrimidine C5 and C6 sites. It is important to note that other dispersion experiments such as R1ρ will also benefit from using RNAs transcribed with isolated spin systems.

Slowing the rate of transmission, requires information about who is infected and where they are located. China achieved this through testing large numbers of individuals suspected of being infected and moving individuals who tested positive to isolation. In South Korea, which saw the second large spike in COVID-19, government officials have taken an approach of combining large-scale testing with transparent data sharing on where affected individuals are located. Although the success of this approach is clear, it has not been universally implemented. For example, Italy has not adopted this approach, and their rates of infection have steeply risen in recent days, with lack of universal testing potentially playing a role in this unfortunate development. While China's and South Korea's approach has been successful, it has two major limitations that prevent its application in the vast majority of other countries: diagnostic testing capacity is limited and personal and health privacy laws are more restrictive. For example, in the United States, an emerging world epicenter, large-scale testing is still not available in the vast majority of US states. For several weeks after community spreads have been documented in multiple US states, the tests were still limited to people with severe symptoms and with international travel history to places with early outbreak (e.g. China, South Korea, Japan, Iran). With limited capacity in testing, the numbers reported as ""confirmed cases"" in our communities (e.g. https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) do not reflect the true numbers or the actual rate of COVID-19 spread.

Furthermore, countries with residual circulating virus would have to be completely isolated to avoid reintroduction. Still, prolonged intensive control could be a means to gain time until the development and large-scale availability of a vaccine. However, the amount of time this will take is unpredictable. An alternative approach is to develop herd immunity through natural infection while keeping the number of cases within the limits of the health care system. Until recently, the UK has advocated this approach, 4 but it was heavily criticized for obvious reasons: it will be practically impossible to perfectly tune actual interventions without exceeding or undershooting health care capacity.

Ribavirin is the only drug so far administered on large scale and having demonstrated a decrease of mortality rates up to 5%, if administered within the first 6 days of arenaviral illness [73] . On the other hand, Ribavirin is ineffective against coronaviruses [74, 75] , as nsp14 ExoN domain excises the nucleotide analogue [51] . It is likely, that for Arenaviridae, the ExoN activity involved in a ""limited proof-reading"" mechanism remains as a trace of its past common ancestor with Coronaviridae.

Fortunately, China Government has implemented a series of large-scale public health interventions to control the epidemic. In fact, many prevention and control measures taken by China, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, go far beyond the requirements for responding to emergencies, setting new benchmarks for epidemic prevention in other countries. The Chinese method has proven to be successful. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, and the simplest and most direct thing that can explain this is the data (Fig.7) .",10.09861733298823,8.390085977548994

Perhaps the most important one has to do with the inability of current large-scale epidemiological models to fully account for behavioral changes in the population when a disease is evolving. As it is the case for the spreading of COVID-19, the information −and more often than desired, misinformation− travels faster than the disease. This produces undesired effects such as a collapse in the emergency rooms at hospitals, a proliferation of information sources that do not provide sensible advices in all cases, anticipated economic loses and, in general, uncoordinated responses. Therefore, it is a pressing challenge to develop more realistic ways to incorporate in models like the one employed here all these risk-averse responses and reactions. Another limitation of the current study includes the relatively low spatial resolution, which is essentially determined by the data availability. The results however indicate that the level of granularity used here is enough to capture mobility patterns and the effects of possible interventions. Finally, we have not considered the temporal and spatial variability of disease parameters, nor other potentially important characteristics of the host population such as the existence of super spreaders or the age structure, which seems to play a relevant role for this disease, at least in what concerns the case fatality rate. We plan to investigate on all these issues in the near future.",8.6138355879459,6.7205900720721115
