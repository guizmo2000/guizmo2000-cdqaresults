The necessity to escape or avoid the host adaptive immune response can result in the accumulation of CTL and/or antibody escape mutations that are tailored to the specific host genotype, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. Whilst these mutations will be advantageous in the current individual, evidence suggests that antigenic escape in HIV-1, HCV, and HBV can have substantial fitness costs when measured in the absence of specific immune responses [25] [26] [27] . This can put viruses harbouring escape mutations at a disadvantage in hosts with different genotypes, potentially hindering transmission. This is supported by a number of findings. First, HIV-1 variants matching the population consensus are more likely to be transmitted, even if these variants are in a minority within the donor at the time of transmission [28] . Second, the rapid reversion of some CTL escape mutations if they infect HLA mismatched hosts [29] . Third, the frequency of CTL escape mutations that carry a large cost is proportional to the frequency of the corresponding HLA alleles in the host population, but CTL escape mutations with little or no cost tend to accumulate at the population level [30] .",18.841491822959192,11.804727514183941

The continuous and linear accumulation of mutations within a single influenza lineage, as was seen in H1N1 during the 2009-2010 influenza season (in which about 0.3% of all nucleotides mutated), supports the concept that natural genetic attenuation may be an important factor in the natural cessation of influenza pandemics. Thus, the possibility of an artificial acceleration of mutation rate deserves further investigation, and may suggest new avenues of research in terms of pandemic management [13] . It is clear that natural selection is strongly at work in the influenza genome. This can be seen by preservation of all the basic proteins and functions of the virus, in spite of the fact that every possible point mutation happens in every human individual during the course of an infection. A large fraction of all deleterious mutations clearly must be selected away. Likewise, the emergence of major antigenic variants shows that positive selection is operational. It is also clear that genetic drift is strongly in operation, with a major viral bottleneck happening at each transmission from one human host to the next, and perhaps at the start of each local outbreak [33] , ensuring that most unique genotypes are very quickly lost. Yet, in addition to selection and drift, it also appears there is very strong mutational pressure on the influenza genome, potentially leading to lethal mutagenesis in most strains, and a gradual, natural genetic attenuation of human influenza in general.",24.385588043505805,11.958657041938304

Evaluating the relative roles of natural selection and genetic drift in driving the maintenance or loss of MHC diversity is challenging, and discordant results have been reported. Some studies found similar population structures between MHC and neutral loci, and it was proposed that genetic drift may overwhelm selection in shaping MHC variation, especially in small and bottlenecked populations [1, 12, 13] . Elevated MHC differentiation across populations has also been reported, supporting the dominant role of fluctuating selection [14] [15] [16] . Moreover, limited gene flow among populations can promote local adaptation to consistent pathogen communities, and this spatial variation in pathogen selection regimes may also create more structure in MHC genes [8, 17, 18] .",25.185853200525223,11.229325589616657

Whilst these mutations will be advantageous in the current individual, evidence suggests that antigenic escape in HIV-1, HCV, and HBV can have substantial fitness costs when measured in the absence of specific immune responses [25] [26] [27] . This can put viruses harbouring escape mutations at a disadvantage in hosts with different genotypes, potentially hindering transmission. This is supported by a number of findings.

Second, the rapid reversion of some CTL escape mutations if they infect HLA mismatched hosts [29] .

A similar case is Parry's Lagoon virus (PLV), a serotype of CORV. In contrast to the wide vertebrate host range of CORV [80] , the antigenically related PLV showed a distinct cell tropism and replicated only in insect cells [81] . With the available data we may speculate that such shifts in cell tropism could be the result of successive changes through recombination, genetic drift and shift. Reoviridae is a very successful family of segmented dsRNA viruses, having wide host ranges across various econiches. The family's repertoire of evolutionary strategies also includes deletion [82, 83] , gene duplication and concatemerisation [9, 84, 85] . These strategies were also observed previously in aquareoviruses [86] , rotaviruses [87] , phytoreoviruses [88] and even in a cross-family heterologous recombinant virus containing reovirus genomic components [89] . This suggests an increased potential for ""species jumps"" and adaptation to new vectors and/or hosts [81, 86] .",17.384792039232735,7.9491347196728475

Viral quasispecies are defined as distributions of nonidentical but related genomes subjected to a continuous process of genetic variation, competition, selection and genetic drift, and which act as a unit of selection . Their high genetic diversity in host populations is partially explained by the low replication fidelity of viral RNA-dependent DNA (RdDp) or RNA polymerases (RdRp), which lack proofreading activity (Steinhauer et al., 1992; Domingo and Holland, 1997) . Eukaryotic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses do not encode DNA polymerases (Gutierrez, 2000; Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 2000) and replicate their genomes using unknown host cell polymerases. High mutation frequencies of approximately 10 −4 mutations per nucleotide as well as substitution rates similar or even higher than those observed for RNA viruses have been found in ssDNA viruses such as animal circoviruses (family Circoviridae) (Firth et al., 2009; Harkins et al., 2014; Sarker et al., 2014) and parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) (López-Bueno et al., 2006) , or plant geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) (Isnard et al., 1998; Sanz et al., 1999; Ge et al., 2007; Holmes, 2008, 2009; Urbino et al., 2008; van der Walt et al., 2008; Harkins et al., 2009 ) and nanoviruses (family Nanoviridae) (Grigoras et al., 2010; Stainton et al., 2015) Observed genetic diversity within mutant spectra at a given time during viral evolution is the result of natural selection, genetic drift and migration over the continuous generation of viral variants.

Different geographical distribution ranges, the intricate landform and the weather conditions of the sampled populations might have limited migration. In this study, the coefficient of genetic differentiation (G ST ) of the species was 0.6728, the proportion of diversity among populations based on the Shannon indices was similarly high (67.42%); correspondingly, the estimate of gene flow (Nm) is low (0.2431); and the AMOVA test also showed that there was high genetic diversity among populations (77%) and low genetic diversity within the population (23%). H. cordata is a relic of its agamic race [1] , and the plant is small and short. This constrains gene flow via seed and pollen dispersal, and thus the plant fails to reproduce extraneously in each highly isolated population. Cytological examinations revealed that H. cordata is a polyploidy complex with 36 to 126 chromosomes [19] , which hinders gene exchanges among populations harboring different numbers of chromosomes. Therefore, these patterns of variation are due not to ongoing gene flow, but rather to historical association among populations. According to the geographical distribution and the affinities shown in the UPGMA dendrogram (Figure 1 ), H. cordata might have survived in Southwest China during the last Pleistocene glaciation. The route extended southeastward of Southwest China along the Yungui Plateau Range, where the present distribution pattern appeared. The strong differentiation among populations may be mainly due to subsequent genetic drift and natural selection. Genetic drift changes the distribution of genetic variation either by reducing variation within a population or by increasing the differentiation among populations [18] . Although the UPGMA dendrogram ( Figure 1 ) indicated that the distribution of H. cordata in China took on an overall pattern of eastward expansion, the lack of significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance supports the hypothesis of historical relationships and the subsequent action of genetic drift accounts for current-day patterns of variation.",25.733487199711004,11.733707041381319

New sequence-based techniques for pathogen detection and identification have the potential to become perhaps the most important component of these investigations, as demonstrated in the recent worldwide effort in fighting the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The discovery of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiological agent for SARS was a major breakthrough [1] , which was quickly followed by the successful sequencing of the whole genome of the virus [2, 3] . Genome sequence comparison between this new coronavirus and the three known classes of coronavirus revealed a similar genome structure, but minimum homology at the amino acid level, strongly suggesting that the SARS-CoV was a new class of coronavirus [2, 3, 4] . A comparative sequence analysis of 14 SARS isolates from different countries suggested a moderate genetic diversity among the SARS isolates and thus implied a slow evolution of the SARS-CoV genome [5] . Furthermore, sequence variation analyses of SARS-CoV isolates demonstrated that common genetic variations in the SARS-CoV genome could be used as ''molecular fingerprints'' to partition the viral isolates into different genetic lineages, track the transmission of a specific viral lineage, and infer the origin of infection [5, 6] .

We contend that these approaches can be synthesized within a single population genetic framework. Specifically, the cross-species transmission and emergence of a virus in a new host can be envisioned as a simple form of the adaptive process, in which the subject under consideration is the acquisition of mutations that facilitate replication and transmission and hence increase viral fitness. Although they may be of myriad form, the ecological factors that dictate whether such an emergence event will be successful are directly analogous to the random sampling effects that necessarily impact the spread of any new allele in a population, increasing the likelihood of genetic drift that will in turn result in stochastic loss. For example, the extensive contact heterogeneity (i.e. lack of susceptible hosts) that prevents CIV spreading in the domestic dog population is equivalent to the fate of an advantageous allele in a small host population. That is, although the virus (mutation) may be host-adapted (advantageous), it will not spread far because the host population is so small/sparse that genetic drift dominates substitution dynamics (and even strongly advantageous alleles may be lost rather than fixed in small populations).",30.45834274113607,14.61280517038853

Because of a lack of host contacts, or descendants, genetic drift will reduce sampling of the fittest virus and decrease the probability of emergence. Hence, as the host population increases in size, the probability that a virus will be sampled increases ( figure 4) , although it is likely that additional factors, including prior immunity and population age rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org Open Biol. 7: 170189 structure, will also impact the probability of virus sampling. A simple lesson from this new approach is that host population size and density-which can be thought of as comprising the 'effective susceptible population size' for an emerging virus-will have a major impact on whether a new virus will successfully spread in a population, irrespective of the fitness of a particular mutation (i.e. whether a virus contains all the mutations necessary to adapt it to a new host). Consequently, if the fitness of a virus and the effective susceptible population size were known, or even measurable, it would be possible to make bounded estimates of how likely a successful emergence event might be. The importance of genetic drift can also be seen in the transmission bottlenecks that will routinely occur as a virus moves between hosts [58] , which probably put a brake on host adaptation [58 -62] . Even if a specific variant is favoured within an individual host, but does not increase sufficiently in frequency (i.e. such that is still found at sub-consensus levels), then a severe population bottleneck may result in its loss. Clearly, the more severe the population bottleneck, the less natural selection will be able to optimize viral fitness at the epidemiological scale. Despite the insights provided by this population genetic framework, the vastness of the unknown virosphere means that all such theories of emergence are probably of more use in predicting the population impact of emergence rather than predicting what might emerge next and in what location.",27.06706180495224,13.067804088322028

Therefore, vaccine design is not only supported by immunoinformatics methods for epitope prediction [63] [64] [65] , but also by statistical genetics and phylogenetic methods for analyzing genetic diversity and predicting evolutionary changes. To predict the evolution of the influenza HA gene, phylogenetic trees were constructed based on DNA sequences derived from viruses during the years 1983 through 1997 [22] . Eighteen codons were identified to be under positive selective pressure and the genetic diversity at these loci was significantly higher than at the other loci of the HA gene [59] . The rationale for predicting the next dominant virus is that extant strains with additional mutations at the 18 loci will be better adapted to evade the host immune response and thus have a selective advantage in the coming season. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the viral lineages with the greatest number of mutations in the positively selected codons were the ancestors of future H3 lineages in 9 out of 11 influenza seasons [22] . This approach to predicting the evolution of influenza relies on solving two classical evolutionary biology problems: the detection of genetic loci under selective pressure and the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of a set of individuals. Quantifying the relative contributions of selection versus random genetic drift is a longstanding task rooted in Kimura's theory of neutral evolution which predicts that most mutations are selectively neutral [66, 67] . Selection is typically identified by testing for departure from neutrality, although such deviations can also have different causes. The statistical tests are either based on the allelic distribution or on comparing variability in different classes of mutations [68] . Tajima's D is the prototype test of the first kind [69] . It detects differences in two distinct estimates of genetic diversity. The null distribution of the test statistic D is obtained from sampling genealogies according to the coalescent, a stochastic process describing the sampling variation [70, 71] . Similarly, the Ewens-Watterson test compares the observed to the expected homozygosity based on the Ewens sampling formula for the infinite-alleles model [72, 73] . In the second category of tests fall the McDonald-Kreitman test [74] and likelihood ratio tests based on the allelic distribution in nonsynonymous versus synonymous sites [58, 75] . Codon usage in influenza sequences has also been analyzed based on codon volatility, which measures the degree to which a random nucleotide mutation is expected to change the corresponding amino acid [76] .",25.407709896768296,12.30992604203205

Truly understanding disease emergence therefore requires a new mechanistic and integrated view of the factors that allow or prevent viruses spreading in novel hosts. We present such a view, suggesting that both ecological and genetic aspects of virus emergence can be placed within a simple population genetic framework, which in turn highlights the importance of host population size and density in determining whether emergence will be successful.

Indeed, the factors that we proposed to explain the increased genetic drift of HIV in culture should play similar, or even larger, roles in HIV populations in patients.

Several models have been proposed to explain the observed high genetic drift, including multiple selective sweeps [22] , metapopulation structure [23, 24] and rare but severe population bottlenecks [25] . All of these models, however, implicitly assume that viral population replicating under homogenous well-mixed conditions should behave as an ideal population. Ideal populations are expected to undergo a certain amount of genetic drift, but real viral populations are also influenced by to the stochastic nature of the biological processes involved in viral replication. Therefore, real viral populations can be expected to have an excess of genetic drift, even under ''close-to-ideal'' conditions.

Indeed, we found that genetic drift can be significantly reduced when infections are synchronized. Synchronization removes the ''late'' viral population and, therefore, the total size of viral population becomes much closer to the size of the ''early'' population. This results in a more synchronous production of virus particles in the second generation (the major contributor to genetic drift), which becomes discrete reducing the observed genetic drift. Yet even in synchronized infections, genetic drift is higher in HIV populations than in an ideal population. We believe that the reasons for that lie in differences in metabolic state of target cells, their lifespan, or expression levels of positive and negative factors involved in viral replication. These and other individual differences between target cells can introduce stochastic events into the viral life cycle. For example, it has recently been proposed that positive feedback loops in transactivation of RNA synthesis by viral protein Tat lead to stochastic differences in levels of viral gene expression [29] . As a result, the viral population is randomly divided into actively replicating and latent subpopulations. In general, these and other factors may lead to a non-Poisson distribution in the number of progeny per parent and affect the amount of genetic drift in the population [30] . Interestingly, our data showed that genetic drift in a heterogeneous mixture of C8166 and CEMx174 cells was similar to genetic drift in a more homogeneous C8166 culture, which appears to contradict this prediction. However, it is possible that the differences between target cells in those experiments were not sufficient to result in an observable effect. Additional experiments are needed to establish the relevant biological differences of different target cells and the effect of those differences on genetic drift in viral populations.",34.01731528325224,15.321509002836251

The evolutionary implications for these two mechanisms are different. Changes in genetic variance imply that the relative influence of selection and drift on the fate of mutations depends on the host. Exposure to hosts where the genetic variance in absolute fitness effects is low minimizes the efficiency by which selection operates either removing deleterious alleles or fixing beneficial ones and thus enhances the role of drift. By contrast, changes in rank order imply that selection favor different mutations in different hosts thus driving to a balanced polymorphism and specialization. We have assessed the extent to which these two possibilities may contribute to the observed G6E and found that both indeed coexist. Antagonistic pleiotropy does not contribute significantly to G6E when the novel host is closely related to the natural one, however, it becomes an important factor when hosts are distantly related (Figure 3) . Similarly, genetic variance for absolute fitness was similar within Solanaceae hosts, but approximately one order of magnitude smaller for hosts outside the Solanaceae. Therefore, we conclude that the observed G6E interaction can be explained both by antagonistic pleiotropy and by changes in the genetic component of variance. Previous studies with E. coli showed that G6E was mainly explained by changes in genetic variance but not by changes in the rank order of fitness effects across environments [26] . However, other authors found that the contribution of new mutations to G6E for fitness traits in D. melanogaster was mostly via antagonistic pleiotropy [40] .",20.18074400969055,11.819397130724761

Here, we present evidence that BKV is under strong purifying selection even in the immunocompromised host. Several specific features of the Polyomaviridae (e.g., limited size of the genome, small number of genes and overlapping transcription units) likely account for this outcome. In addition, the prevalence of purifying selection in essential genes is anticipated in all viruses as there is a requirement to complete the viral cycle, even in immunocompromised hosts. Most mutations in coding regions must be deleterious, and a high substitution rate implies the accumulation of mutations with deleterious effects [18] . This phenomenon is well known in RNA viruses, which have high mutation rates and short replication times. Similar results have been shown comparing mutational fitness effects and evolution in ssRNA and ssDNA viruses [19, 20] . Our study supports the hypothesis, in concordance with other recent findings [21] , that the evolutionary rate gap between small dsDNA and RNA viruses might not be as wide as previously thought. A recent study in lentiviruses has revealed that the combined effects of sequence saturation and purifying selection can explain the time-dependent pattern of rate variation. Purifying selection acts on the genetic diversity over long timeframes by removing a large number of transient deleterious mutations that are still present within short timeframes [4] .",28.232202065680085,11.698346213939567

The increasing threats imposed by emerging and re-emerging viruses make it even more urgent to predict whether and when virus populations replicating in their reservoir hosts will acquire the ability to successfully infect individuals of a new host species, adapt to it and, eventually, turn into an epidemic. To make such predictions we must first identify the factors determining why some viruses, like Hepatitis C virus, Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Influenza A virus or Cucumber mosaic virus have been so successful in causing pandemics whereas other viruses such as SARS coronavirus, Ebola virus, Hantan virus, or Cocoa swollen shoot disease virus produced outbreaks limited in time and space. A pre-requisite for viral emergence is the existence of standing genetic variation within the reservoir host that enables successful virus replication within naïve hosts after spillover by chance [2, 3, 8] .

In more practical terms, characterizing the shape of DMFE is essential for understanding the nature of quantitative genetic variation, here including complex human diseases as well as pathogens virulence [32] . Therefore, it is not surprising that much effort has been recently invested in characterizing the DMFE for many organisms (reviewed in [32] ), including several RNA and DNA viruses. Despite differences in the genetic material of these viruses, their sizes and gene contents, the methodology applied has been similar in all cases, namely, generating collections of single-nucleotide substitutions mutants and then characterizing the fitness of each of these mutants relative to the non-mutated parental. In RNA viruses such as bacteriophage Qb [16] , Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [19] and TEV [20] , over one third of mutations generated unviable viruses, whereas viable mutations reduced fitness, on average, by ,10% [21] . Regarding the theoretical pdf that better explained these datasets, VSV fitness data conformed to a complex distribution combining a Log-normal and an Uniform pdfs, the original TEV larger dataset was best fitted by a Beta pdf (notice that in [20] fitness was measured as a relative value, which may justify the difference to the Weibull pdf conclusion reached here), and the Qb DMFE was well described by a Gamma pdf. In the case of DNA phages wX174 [16] and f1 [17] the fraction of unviable mutations was lower (one fifth) but the average effect of viable mutations was almost identical to the one reported for RNA viruses [21] . wX174 best fitting was to the Exponential pdf whereas for f1 the Log-Normal and the Weibull fitted equally well. Taken together, all these results suggested the existence of certain common rules: a large fraction of mutations are lethal or have a large negative fitness effects (displaying the fragility of viral genomes).

RI panels are popular because of their long-term genetic stability, which enhances reproducibility and integration of data collected across time and conditions. Characterization of their genomes can be a community effort, reducing the burden on individual users. Here we present the genomes of the CC strains using two complementary approaches as a resource to improve power and interpretation of genetic experiments. Our study also provides a cautionary tale regarding the limitations imposed by such basic biological processes as mutation and selection. A distinct advantage of inbred panels is that genotyping only needs to be performed on the panel, not on each individual mouse. The initial CC genome data were haplotype reconstructions based on dense genotyping of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of each strain followed by imputation from the genome sequence of the corresponding founder inbred strain. The MRCA resource captured segregating regions in strains that were not fully inbred, but it had limited resolution in the transition regions between founder haplotypes, and there was uncertainty about founder assignment in regions of limited diversity. Here we report the whole genome sequence of 69 CC strains generated by paired-end short reads at 303 coverage of a single male per strain. Sequencing leads to a substantial improvement in the fine structure and completeness of the genomes of the CC. Both MRCAs and sequenced samples show a significant reduction in the genome-wide haplotype frequencies from two wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ. In addition, analysis of the evolution of the patterns of heterozygosity indicates that selection against three wild-derived founder strains played a significant role in shaping the genomes of the CC. The sequencing resource provides the first description of tens of thousands of new genetic variants introduced by mutation and drift in the CC genomes. We estimate that new SNP mutations are accumulating in each CC strain at a rate of 2.4 6 0.4 per gigabase per generation. The fixation of new mutations by genetic drift has introduced thousands of new variants into the CC strains. The majority of these mutations are novel compared to currently sequenced laboratory stocks and wild mice, and some are predicted to alter gene function. Approximately one-third of the CC inbred strains have acquired large deletions (.10 kb) many of which overlap known coding genes and functional elements. The sequence of these mice is a critical resource to CC users, increases threefold the number of mouse inbred strain genomes available publicly, and provides insight into the effect of mutation and drift on common resources.",22.255313066652985,12.536334196531822

All of the FIPVs and FECVs isolated from the five cats that had close contact with each other in Sonoma, California were ≥99% related (Tables 1 and 3; Figure 1 ). Based on gene sequences and historical facts, it can be reasonably concluded that cat Simba was infected with an FECV following contact with cat Lucy. This supported another correlate of the internal mutation theory; FECVs are easily spread cat-to-cat, while FIPVs are not. Addie et al. [33] also noted that the same strain of coronavirus tended to persist among any given group of cats. However, coronaviruses within a closely housed group of cats, and even within the same cat, undergo continuous genetic drift. We observed sequence differences of 1-2% or less in cats from the same group, while genetic drift between cats from distant areas of the western US was on the order of 6-16%. Herewegh et al. [34] also found that feline coronaviruses from individuals within the same environment had unique genetic fingerprints and fell within the same clade, while geographically distant isolates belonged to genetically unique clades. The notable mutational drift observed among feline coronaviruses across geographic regions, in the face of genetic conservation within stable groups of cats, is paradoxical. However, the evidence indicates that coronavirus infection in any group of cats originates from a single founder virus, that virtually every cat in a group is infected rapidly and efficiently, and that cats appear to resist superinfection with closely related strains [34] . The single founder virus effect was confirmed in the present study (Table 4) . Thus, marked genetic drift occurs when a single coronavirus strain is serially passed from one susceptible population to the next. This scenario was supported by our animal transmission studies; when cats were simultaneously infected with two closely related variants of FIPV, each variant segregated into different cats. Therefore, minor mutants may become predominate when passed cat-to-cat.",30.729019461634692,11.679715977109499

Hence, the discrepancies in the evolution of HBV was investigated. Eight related patients with acquired chronic HBV through mother-to-infant transmission were selected and the viral genomes isolated were analyzed. Sequence analysis indicated that the samples originated from a single source of HBV genotype B2 (HBV-B2) which diverged from a tiny common ancestral pool regardless of the route of acquisition. Between individuals, viral strains obtained from a time point showed evidence that they originated from a small pool of the previous time point. This conferred the strain an advantage over other strains with regards to the recovery of the founder state shortly after transmission to the new host and the adaptation to the local environment within the host. Natural selection rather than genetic drift was hypothesized to be the root cause for the evolution of HBV, due to the observed varying patterns of divergence at synonymous and non-synonymous sites. This was in line with the higher rate of substitutions within the host rather than between hosts. Approximately 85/88 amino acid residues changed from common to rare residues. Since these changes were shown not to be a random process, it is concluded that the HBV was able to evolve and change but was limited to a defined range of phenotypes. It can be argued that the mechanism observed thus far suggest that the adaptive mutations accumulated in one individual would not be maintained in another individual and might revert after transmission. Hence, within the host, substitutions were higher than between hosts [156] .",23.60218216529977,10.302143120199661

Fixation of mutations into nucleotide substitutions, a key principle behind phylogenetic signatures, is shaped by major evolutionary forces such as selection (molecular adaptation deriving from an increasing fitness of a corresponding phenotypic trait) and genetic drift (stochastic gene sampling process at reproduction) [23, 24] . A useful tool to detect and measure selection in viral gene sequences is the ratio between synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions. Whereas a ratio above 1.0 is an indicator of positive selection operating at the amino acid sequence level [25] , significantly lower values are generally referred to as purifying selection and refer to preservation of the phenotypic trait.",24.005094152805007,11.7307373521138

Although our data suggest that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selective pressure for increased fidelity, we detected no primary reversion at the DE-to-AA substitutions in MHV-ExoN(-) at any passage tested. These data are consistent with and significantly extend previous studies reporting genotypic stability of ExoN(-) motif I in MHV and SARS-CoV (13, 14, 16, 17, 38) . Complete reversion to DE within ExoN(-) motif I would require four nucleotide changes. This likely represents a high genetic barrier to reversion, especially given that fitness can be increased by mutations outside nsp14-ExoN (Fig. 7F) (13) . Single and double nucleotide changes within motif I could restore an acidic charge to individual residues (e.g., motif I EA, AD, ED, etc.). However, the active site compositions of DEDDh exonucleases, such as the Klenow fragment, are so stringent that even conservative mutations (D to E or E to D) reduce ExoN activity by Ͼ96% (68). Thus, intermediate amino acid changes may not have a selective advantage compared to motif I AA, limiting the evolutionary pathways to reversion. However, nsp14-P250 had detectable effects on RBV and AZC resistance as well as on the competitive fitness of MHV-ExoN(-) (Fig. 7F) , demonstrating a modest capacity for fitness adaptation in nsp14 outside the catalytic residues. Whether these mutations resulted from genetic drift or positive selection remains unclear. Nevertheless, our data show that MHV-ExoN(-) can adapt for increased fitness without fully restoring exoribonuclease activity. While some mutations in MHV-ExoN(-) P250 likely confer DBT cellspecific selective advantages, others may represent generalizable strategies for overcoming ExoN(-) defects in other cell types and in other coronaviruses. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which MHV-ExoN(-) P250 compensated for ExoN activity could allow recovery of ExoN(-) variants of other CoVs, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus and human CoV 229E, which to date have been nonviable as ExoN(-) recombinants (42, 69) .",19.825548768687984,11.434627610670585

They averred further that Africa has the highest persistence and relative genetic diversity; even when extrapolated to 2016. Persistence and, hence, perpetuation of HPAI H5N1 are either reflected as a result of antigenic drift (which tends to cause only small changes in the biological behavior of the virus) or antigenic shift (the exchange of hemagglutinin antigens or neuraminidase antigens) between different influenza A virus subtypes coinfecting a particular host thereby resulting in genetic reassortment; these subtypes have conveniently adapted to both humans and swine, and currently circulate in nature [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Genetic reassortment can produce new influenza A viruses, such as in the case of the recent pandemic influenza A H5N1, H5N2, and H5N9 outbreaks experienced in France [30, 43] , H5N1 with different sublineages in Egypt [27, 44] , and the many HPAI subtypes recorded in Asia after the first outbreak of HPAI in 1996 giving rise to novel virions [45, 46] .

Efficient influenza A vaccines are available, which induce antibodies predominantly against the two major components of the virus membrane, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuramidase (NA). Protection is mediated primarily by neutralizing antibodies against HA [2, 3] . Since HA undergoes continuous change due to mutations (antigenic drift), new antigenic variants of influenza A arise every year requiring constant update of the vaccines. Effective vaccination is further complicated by the occasional reassortment of the segmented viral genome leading to the replacement of HA or NA from one subtype by another subtype, a processs called antigenic shift [4] .

Poor reporting is a major constraint to the surveillance of both emerging and endemic zoonoses, and several important barriers to reporting can be identified: (i) a lack of tangible benefits when reports are made; (ii) a lack of capacity to enforce regulations; (iii) poor communication among communities, institutions and sectors; and (iv) complexities of the international regulatory environment.

As a result of these mutations, the influenza virus changes its protein coat (antigens) and allows them to find new susceptible non-immune populations to infect. Both mechanisms of genetic mutation have the possibility of producing a new virus that can be easily transmitted between humans and initiate a pandemic.

While some strains only cause mild to asymptomatic infections, known as Low Pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LP), High Pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HP) can have an extremely high mortality rate in both domestic and wild bird populations, leading to huge economic loses ( Figure 8A ) [61] . Thus, surveillance of AIVs is crucial for early detection of outbreaks. Although virulence is a polygenic trait, molecular determinants of virulence have been well characterised for AIVs, such as a polybasic proteolytic cleavage site within the hemagglutinin protein, which enables a systemic viral spread within the host [62] . We hypothesise that the parallel evolution of HP lineages from LP ancestors may have been facilitated by permissive or compensatory secondary mutations occurring anywhere in the viral genome, preceding or following the appearance of a polybasic proteolytic cleavage site. We used a comparative phylogenetic and structural approach to detect shared mutations evolving under positive selection across the whole genome of HP AIVs of the H7NX and H5NX subtypes and developed a model that statistically assesses genotype-phenotype associations. We present cumulative evolutionary and structural evidence that supports the association between parallel mutations and the evolution of the HP phenotype. Parallel mutations occur frequently among HP lineages of the same viral subtype ( Figure 8B ). Many of the mutations have been previously determined to increase viral fitness in terms of their biological properties, whilst most of these are ranked as stabilising to protein structure, supporting that these are rather permissive/compensatory. The mutational panel provided here may function as an early detection system for transitional virulence stages. Circulating AIVs that do not have a polybasic cleavage site yet, but show all or some of the amino acid changes ranked, should remain under surveillance. Year of circulation, virus subtype and consensus sequence for the polybasic Cleavage Site (pCS) within the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein are indicated for the selected outbreaks used in this work (C1-C9). Each outbreak corresponds to a distinct genotype, defined as well-supported clusters within all viral genome segment trees (data not shown).

Branches within the trees are coloured according to the corresponding amino acid states in nodes (tip states not shown). Ancestral nodes preceding the emergence of a mutation associated with the HP lineages are represented with coloured circles.

Similarly, five parallel mutations have been observed in the two independent epidemics of SARS coronavirus following its jump from palm civets into humans [17] . Similar patterns have been seen in experimental evolution studies, where parallel genetic changes occur repeatedly when replicate viral lineages adapt to a new host species in the lab. For example, when Vesicular Stomatitis Virus was passaged in human or dog cells, the virus evolved parallel mutations when evolved on the same cell type [18] . Likewise, a study passaging Tobacco Etch Potyvirus on four plant species found parallel mutations occurred only when the virus infected the same host species [19] .

However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D G64S , has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3D G64S populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D G64S under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D G64S exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D G64S growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.",22.41278370851412,12.354972070673576

Work with barcoded RNA viruses suggests that the serial bottlenecks between the infecting population and the terminal population colonizing the central nervous system (CNS) are quite stringent [52, 53] , and we used published data to quantify the aggregate bottleneck size encountered by poliovirus in transgenic mice [46, 49, 50] . Maximum likelihood optimization of a simple probabilistic model estimated an aggregate bottleneck size of 2.67 between the inoculum and the CNS (Fig 4A, S1 Text Model 2).

In Australia, all laboratory-confirmed influenza cases are reported to the NNDSS (Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System) database [13] , which collects information on location (postcode) sample date, age, sex, influenza type, and subtype. This data is supplemented by the nationwide general practitioner (GP) influenza surveillance network [14] , which records influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community and sends a selection of respiratory samples taken from patients with ILI attending GP surgeries to be tested for influenza. Another network, FluCAN (Australian Influenza Complications Alert Network) [15] , records hospital attendance and admissions from patients suffering from influenza across all age groups. These networks allow the estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medical attendance for community-based individuals [16] and against hospital admission each year [17] . These detection methods are supplemented by a national online weekly reporting surveillance system for cough and fever (Flutracking) [18] , as well as a national medical hotline [19] , which records enquiries related to ILI. There is also national death data due to influenza, as well as excess mortalities due to influenza and pneumonia being determined for the most populous state of Australia, New South Wales (NSW). These data are collated into the Australian Influenza Surveillance Report by the Australian Department of Health, which publishes fortnightly reports on the web from May to November each year [20] . Would these measures be sufficient to detect or track the introduction or outcomes of a new influenza pandemic as it spread throughout the country? Probably not, as detection of a new influenza pandemic virus would be dependent on general practitioners' willingness to test samples from patients with ILI. If the cases were mild, then this is less likely to happen, as many general practitioners are reluctant to have laboratory testing performed on their patients with ILI and they rely on their knowledge and clinical presentation to make a diagnosis. If the case was more serious, or even fatal, then the chances of the patient being tested in a hospital setting and diagnosed correctly are increased, but a novel virus might still be mistyped in the laboratory, unless they had specific reagents. In addition, there are the inherent delays of at least 2-3 weeks in most of these systems, and they also lack the ability to provide sufficient data on sub-populations of most interest, such as pregnant women, indigenous populations, obese individuals, and individuals with other predisposing conditions who might have higher morbidity and mortality in a pandemic situation. Hence, the Australian Department of Health has explored the use of ""first few hundred"" studies and are also trialing the WHO PISA process as a potential addition to the current monitoring of seasonal influenza in case of a new influenza pandemic or a human outbreak involving a novel virus, so that they can be better informed. The main document for the management of influenza pandemics in Australia was revised in September 2014 and is known as the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza (AHMPPI) [21] This plan outlines Australia's strategy to manage an influenza pandemic and minimise its impact on the health of Australians and our health system.",18.844904096417842,10.785085253936675

This is a critical result as it suggests that selection is driving the evolution of mutation rates, establishing a trade-off between mutational load and availability of adaptive mutations [7] . However, the processes driving the evolution of different types of viruses are multiple. As already argued, both ssDNA and ssRNA viruses share small genome sizes, high mutation rates, but also large effective population sizes, little to no gene duplication or recombination, and overlapping reading frames [6] . This last point suggests that a less frequently explored evolutionary process in viral studies, correlated evolution, could be as critical as positive selection. Correlated evolution happens when mutations at two locations in a genome occur one after the other, in a quick succession [8] , repeatedly [9] . Typical examples include drug resistance mutations that have a fitness cost, and that require a second mutation to compensate for the first one [10] , or tRNAs that require a specific base-pairing to maintain their secondary and tertiary structures, so that a mutation in the stem region necessitates a second mutation to restore the correct, functional, structure [11] . This process is of particular interest as correlated evolution can be underlain by epistasis, which occurs when the fitness effects of these two mutations are non-additive [12] , as in the two examples above. As such, correlated evolution can help us understand the relationship between genotype and fitness, which is a key determinant of evolutionary trajectories [13] . To date, however, correlated evolution has only sporadically been investigated in viral evolution, and these rare instances only focused on ssRNA viruses. Indeed, recent work uncovered pervasive evidence for correlated evolution in influenza viruses [14, 15] , and both the Zika [16] and the Ebola viruses [17] . Intriguingly, in this latter case (Ebola), evidence was found that sites evolving in a correlated manner could also be under positive selection-bearing the question as to how frequently these two processes, correlated evolution and positive selection, occur, possibly jointly, and if this co-occurrence is limited to ssRNA viruses, or can be generalized to all viruses.",16.511619298863856,7.659795321248925

The broad and multifaceted practices of surveillance approaches are used to monitor the progress and outcome of interventions to mitigate or stop the progression of an outbreak, including of economically and ecologically important animal or plant species and the transmission of zoonotic diseases among animal and human populations over space and time, as well as to predict future transmission patterns [20, 22] . Currently, disease outbreak surveillance and detection relies heavily on the astute individual: the clinician, the veterinarian, the grower, and the livestock manager noticing both routine and suspicious symptoms and bringing them to the attention of the public health or veterinary community including academics and zoological parks. Most developed countries have a surveillance system in place and the ability to detect and diagnose human and animal diseases. Innovations and strategies for the surveillance and detection of human and animal diseases, and assessing the resource needs and opportunities for improving and coordinating infectious disease surveillance, early detection, tracing, case investigation, prompt reporting, and management are needed in upholding health systems strengthening and future sustainable development in most under resourced countries [21, 22] . Technological advances in disease surveillance and detection that have benefited public health surveillance such as rapid, automated, and sensitive biosensors; portable sampling and assay systems; and DNA-based diagnostic tools remain to be adapted to track animal diseases. Models and interventions incorporating M&E systems and true coordination and collaboration would enable optimal surveillance response, thereby driving policy and action, with a feedback process to facilitate continuous evolution and adaptation [20, 21] . Information would be drawn from a broad range of disciplines relevant to physical and mental health, as well as domestic and wild animal health and plant health, through the complementary processes of agent or disease surveillance and host and environmental monitoring with potential economic benefits of surveillance systems for all. Nevertheless, the release of surveillance information should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as trust is not built by merely sharing data, but by helping people understand information that is context-specific. Active engagement to discuss the perception of risk of outbreak and identifying priorities for action is also essential. Community or regional active surveillance systems, new effective rapid diagnostic methods, and prompt reporting have the potential to advance infectious disease control and prevention efforts in Africa and elsewhere. Although, the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE), operated by the Department of Defense, allows epidemiologists to track-in real-timesyndromes reported in daily data feeds from regional hospitals and clinics, it is yet to be actively implemented in most Africa countries. Due to the persistent outbreaks of infectious diseases across Africa, it is crucial to analyze the applicability of surveillance response systems in order to improve the ability of hospital/health center triage systems to identify and appropriately treat patients who show symptoms associated with an emerging infectious disease, a threat of an infectious disease (e.g., influenza, SARS, and Ebola, as well as potential bioterrorism agents such as anthrax and smallpox), or an emerging infectious disease. Laboratory diagnosis may be possible by building a network of information about early warning alert and response systems that travels up or down the public health hierarchy, from the local to the international level and vice versa [20] [21] [22] . 4. Shifting towards an effective public and global health paradigm Due to globalization, health for all under the ""One Health"" initiate calls for immediate Ebola and other outbreak actions plans. A future, in which outbreaks and bioterrorism agents are continually reengineered to evade standard detection and diagnostic methods, as well as therapeutics, is imagined. Hence, Africa and the global community has no choice but to move from postsymptomatic to presymptomatic detection and diagnosis, and to prompt effective surveillance response systems that seek to benefit the global community. Ultimately, to reach the best-case scenario stage in which microbes are ubiquitous, constantly evolving, and adapting requires community and national surveillance policies to inform and guide action on the basis of importance, not for reaction and emergency to dictate priority [21, 22] . There is no magic bullet for changing paradigms; steady progress, albeit being slow, can be made through small successes. This needs to be properly recognized as an effective engine for change to educate the next generation of leaders early in their careers and encourage greater global, inter-, and trans-disciplinary awareness in future public health professionals. The quest for EEE in shifting the public and global health paradigm to achieve the MDGs post the 2015-2030 agenda, the ""One Health, One World"" and other global health initiates requires: Community outreach and advocacy, and local and international mobilization to combat outbreaks in Africa and globally.

Among them, seven positive selection sites were chronologically traced in the temporal evolution routes of genotype D, and six were located around the critical sugar binding region in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein, an important sugar binding domain of CoV. These findings suggest that the genetic drift of the S gene may play an important role in genotype persistence in human populations, providing insights into the mechanisms of HCoV-OC43 adaptive evolution.",22.700068257919696,11.199774559274427

Similarly, recent studies have shown that CNV mutation rates in duplication-rich regions could be significantly higher than SNPs due to their propensity to undergo nonallelic homologous recombination, thereby making CNV to be recurrent at specific loci [70] . Physiologically, the redundancy of CEACAM/PSG genes could be selected for the provision of a robustness against null phenotypes in individuals [71, 72] . In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that transgenic mice deficient for Ceacam1, 9, or 10 exhibit minimal or no aberrant phenotypes [3, 73, 74] . In addition, the enhanced redundancy could, theoretically, further reduce the constraint and add new opportunities for genetic drift or selection to operate on new alleles, thereby allowing the accumulation of nonsynonymous SNPs in duplicated PSG genes. However, it is important to note that the presence of repeated sequences alone could not account for the selection of high genetic variations at the CEACAM/PSG locus. Recent studies of CNV hotspots in humans have identified several duplication-rich regions on chromosome 19, which contain clusters of zinc finger proteins (ZNFs, with a total of 204 members on chromosome 19) [75] . However, these ZNF cluster loci did not exhibit appreciable increases of genetic variations as compared to other genes on chromosome 19. For example, the ratio of ZNF family genes that have a high F ST nonsynonymous SNP (5.4%) is similar to that of other genes on the same chromosome (3.2%).",18.165513622854974,10.88495934191663

The possible link between the positive selection sites and the genetic variability of genotypes should be evaluated in the future studies. The evaluation of relative genetic diversity, substitution rate, dN/dS value, and positive selection sites further showed that genotype D had a significant influence on the relative genetic diversity of OC43 and that its S gene evolved towards heterogeneity. More positive selection sites were also found in the S1 subunit of genotype D. Amino acid substitutions in the surface proteins are considered an important adaption strategy for the persistence of a virus to evade host immune pressure 8, 18 . Although the neutralizing epitopes have not been identified, the substitutions identified in the S1 subunit of OC43 in this study are predicted to be in the antigenicity region (data not shown), which may allow viruses to escape host neutralizing antibodies [19] [20] [21] [22] .

The importance of these mutations is illustrated by experiments that ''rewind the evolutionary tape'' by adapting hostshifted phages back onto the ancestral host and observe reversion mutations restoring the sequence back to the ancestral state [38] . When 40 host range mutants of phi6 phage were isolated, it was found that there were 17 unique mutations underlying this shift [35] . Furthermore, it was estimated that 56 different mutations in the phage genome have the potential to adapt it to the novel host [35] . Therefore, despite some parallelism, in this case the size of the mutational target is significant, but the possible number of combinations is large, so genetic constraints on this host shift are relatively weak. Parallel evolution at the molecular level is also common in experiments using viruses of eukaryotes (Figure 2A) . When vesicular stomatitis virus is evolved in human or dog cells, parallel mutations tend to occur within the same cell type [50] . Similarly in plants, experimental evolution of Tobacco etch potyvirus on four host species found that parallel mutations only occurred when viruses were passaged in the same host species [53] . A number of other studies in plants have found parallel mutations occurring, often after only a few passages on the novel host [54] [55] [56] [57] . Experimental studies finding parallel mutations often enforce transmission and so bypass the critical barrier of successful transmission in the new host.

Although intensified surveillance and massively expanded HIV testing will be a key aspect to controlling the epidemic, a failure to capture key data on risk behaviors, treatment adherence, drug resistance and host and virus genetic sequences from known populations is a missed opportunity. Such data can inform policies to lower HIV incidence and mortality by helping target resources to where the largest impact could be expected, eg, MSM and sex workers (female, male, or transgender). The MENA region is comprised of countries with a wide range of financial resources and technical capacity. Yet most of the data, particularly viral sequence diversity, comes from three middle-income countries: Algeria, Morocco, and Iran (Figure) . 16 Recently, several MENA countries have undertaken initiatives that put their genomic technologic prowess on full display. The Qatar Genome Program, for example, aspires to generate personalized genomic data for its entire population as part of a national precision medicine initiative. 17 In an initial demonstration project, the program sequenced 1000 human genomes and uncovered more than 20 million polymorphisms to analyze. Yet, in the face of this titanic effort to sequence human genomes, not a single viral sequence from the approximately 100 documented HIV cases in Qatar has ever been entered into GenBank, as of April 2017. 18 This incongruity argues that the tools and funding are available, but the political will is lacking for collecting basic virologic information on recognized HIV cases.

Furthermore, other sources of mutation include host enzymes, spontaneous nucleic acid damage, and even special genetic elements located within some viral genomes whose specific function is to produce new mutations Fig. 1 Mutation rate definition. a Basic processes determining population genetic diversity. The observed population frequency of a mutation depends on the rate at which it is produced (mutation rate), but also on natural selection, random genetic drift, and recombination, among other processes. Most mutations are deleterious and tend to be removed from the population by selection, whereas beneficial mutations or combinations of mutations can be maintained/favored. Recombination can also contribute to the maintenance of genetic diversity. Random genetic drift leads to allele fixation and hence reduces population genetic diversity. b Basic processes determining viral mutation rates. Mutations originate from replication errors, nucleic acid damage, and editing of the genetic material by hostencoded proteins or by specialized molecular systems such as diversity-generating retro-elements (DGRs). If these changes are not corrected, they will be passed to the viral progeny and hence will contribute to elevating the viral mutation rate. Expression of host error-prone polymerases may also contribute to creating new mutations in viruses. Recombination can also enhance the ability of some viruses to create new mutations by increasing gene copy number or by producing genome rearrangements (Fig. 1b) . Mutation rates are modulated by additional factors, including proteins involved in replication other than the polymerase, the mode of replication, and the template sequence and structure. In this review, we discuss how these different factors control viral mutation rates.",32.045278616254194,15.664016449080538

In viruses, a generation is often defined as a cell infection cycle, which includes attachment to the cell surface, entry, gene expression, replication, encapsidation, and release of infectious particles. Mutations are not restricted to replication since they can also result from editing of the genetic material, or spontaneous nucleic acid damage. The mutation rate should not be confused with the frequency at which mutations are found in a given viral population. The latter is a measure of genetic variation that depends on a number of other processes such as natural selection, random genetic drift, recombination, and so on (Fig. 1a) . Higher mutation rates lead to higher genetic diversity but, except in special cases, it is not possible to infer mutation rates directly from observed population mutation frequencies [1] . Although genetic diversity depends on multiple factors, the mutation rate is of particular interest because it constitutes the ultimate source of genetic variation. Similarly, mutation rates should not be confused with molecular evolutionary rates. The neutral theory of molecular evolution posits a linear relationship between these two rates, but whereas mutation is a biochemical/genetic process, molecular evolution refers to the fixation of new alleles in populations [2, 3] .",29.89513630165074,14.316856293605714

In our Dutch isolates the ORF4 is highly conserved on the protein level. The CCU T935 isolate that was collected in 1986 at the CCU, Salisbury, is a clinical isolate with high ORF4 similarity to the cell culture-adapted viruses. Since we cannot reconstruct the experimental setting performed during the clinical trail T935 at the CCU in 1986, we cannot exclude the possibility that the CCU T935 sample was obtained from a volunteer inoculated with an HCoV-229E laboratory strain. This strain might even have the same origin as the cell culture-adapted viruses [11] . In any case, the CCU T935 sample is derived from an ""in vivo"" infection, be it experimental or natural, and this further supports a relevant in vivo function of HCoV-229E full-length ORF4 protein. We believe that the divergence between the current Dutch isolates and the early CCU T935 strain most likely represents genetic drift over 20 -30 years of evolution [19] . Molecular clock analysis with the average mutation rate of coronaviruses [20, 21] supports this idea (data not shown). Given the long time of evolution the differences between the CCU T935 and Dutch isolates are remarkably small.

This landscape is not fixed but changes throughout the viral lifecycle, with the magnitude, location, and frequency of the peaks and valleys moving through both time and space [13, 16] . Due to the high error rates produced during RNA virus replication, it is hypothesized that the best strategy for RNA virus survival is to produce a sequence foundation composed of low rolling hills, termed survival of the flattest [17, 18] . Thus, mutations away from the consensus sequence should not have large, detrimental effects as the sequence space is explored, but still allow for the virus to identify fitness peaks to aid in survival during an unstable environment.

Despite significant efforts of continuous surveillance and vaccine strain updates, vaccine mismatches have occurred many times [13] . In addition to potential antigenic mismatch from selection procedure and delays in production, egg-adapted mutations accumulated during egg-based vaccine production can further exacerbate this issue, where the vaccine virus strain obtains relevant functional amino acid changes in the HA protein, resulting in low vaccine effectiveness [14] [15] [16] [17] .

IAV has also been associated with several pandemics in the past however, the IBV and ICV has never been the cause of any pandemic scenario owing to their limitation of host range and less frequent mutations reported till date [4, 6, 9] . The surveillance activities related to ICVs have not gained much importance compared to IAVs and IBVs as it has been associated with mild clinical conditions. The ICVs, apart from infecting humans, have also been reported to infect pigs in China (1981) [31] and the USA (2011) [36] , dogs and camels [34] . The interspecies transmission of ICVs have been attributed to the genetic similarities that exist between the Chinese swine ICVs and human ICVs [37] .",26.21808275853212,14.26278991347666
Genetic drift is caused by point mutations in genes of the virus due to an error-prone RNA polymerase,0.14820030027493944,3.3389668464660645,4.245187282562256,23a76d88-0993-45a5-a227-21ef5da0e719,comm_use_subset/Clinical Medicine Emerging Influenza D Virus Threat: What We Know so Far!,"Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which consists of four generas: Alphainfluenzavirus (Species: Influenza A virus (IAV)), Betainfluenzavirus (Species: Influenza B virus (IBV)), Gammainfluenzavirus (Species: Influenza C virus (ICV)) and Deltainfluenzavirus (Species: Influenza D virus (IDV)) [1 -3] . They are enveloped viruses with segmented genome, comprising of single stranded negative sense RNA. Influenza viruses cause acute respiratory illness and of the four known types, the influenza A virus is a significant public health concern with highest rates of morbidity and fatality [4] [5] [6] . They have a wide host range ( Figure 1 ) and often jumps the species barrier [7] . The emerging and reemerging threats due to IAVs are mainly due to two major events: Genetic drift and genetic shift [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] . Genetic drift is caused by point mutations in genes of the virus due to an error-prone RNA polymerase. Since the mutations take place in the genes encoding for the antibody binding sites, this event is responsible for (i) frequent influenza epidemics and (ii) the requirement of annual influenza vaccine formulations. Genetic shift is the result of genetic re-assortment between the genes of two or more different strains of influenza virus infecting the same cell in a host. This event occasionally generates novel combinations of the two major surface glycoproteins of the virus: Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Since both genetic drift and genetic shift leads to changes in the genetic makeup of the virus, the existing immunity in the host may or may not provide complete protection and thus leads to multiple infections. Pigs, quails and bats have been reported to be the mixing vessels, because they co-express both SAα2,3-Gal and SAα2,6-Gal receptors required for binding with avian and human IAVs [12] [13] [14] . Genetic shift has created novel influenza virus strains with the ability to sustain efficient human-to-human transmission, and thus accountable for several influenza pandemics in the past [4, 11] . A total of 18 novel HA (H1-H18) and 11 NA (N1-N11) have been identified till date, of which most of the possible combinations of 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been reported in water fowl which is the main reservoir of IAVs [15, 16] . The recently identified H17-18 and N10-11 have not been reported in birds and have been found in bats [17, 18] . To date, only 3 HA (H1, H2, and H3) and 2 NA (N1 and N2) subtypes have been reported to cause sustained, human-to-human transmission leading to influenza epidemics [19] . Apart from the human influenza strains, there are several low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) that have been in circulation in wild aquatic birds and poultry thus posing a severe threat to public health. Few of the avian virus strains, such as the H5N1 and the newly emerged H7N9, have infected humans and thus are a significant cause of concern worldwide [20]. (influenza A virus-IAV, influenza B virus-IBV,  influenza C virus-ICV and influenza D virus-IDV) , while others are known to be infected by only specific influenza viruses. Cattles are the major known reservoir of influenza D virus; however, other small ruminants and humans have shown susceptibility to IDV infections in different conditions. The influenza B virus was first identified in the year 1940 [21] . Unlike influenza A viruses that have a wide range of host, the IBVs almost exclusively infects humans with only a few reported cases in seals [22] , horses [23] , dogs [24] and pigs [25] . The IBVs do not have subtypes, but are categorized into two distinct lineages: B/Victoria/2/1987-like (B/Victoria-like) and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like (B/Yamagata-like) viruses that have been circulating worldwide since 1983 [26] . The influenza B viruses also cause annual epidemics, but due to the limitation of the host, they have never been known to be associated with any pandemic.",24.409686117575525,13.47309032501984
site-specific integration has been described for adeno-associated viruses [50],0.26495299334491235,3.3728744983673096,3.325721263885498,3c11bf1d-3eb5-4feb-95e4-832c7cecdbc2,comm_use_subset/Discovery and Genomic Characterization of a Novel Ovine Partetravirus and a New Genotype of Bovine Partetravirus,"Nonetheless, questions remain on certain aspects of parvovirus evolution. Although virus-host co-evolution had been proposed as an important mechanism in the emergence of new animal parvoviruses [22] , this hypothesis cannot be easily reconciled with the high evolutionary rates observed in diverse parvoviruses, as the evolutionary timescale of the genetic distance between the animal hosts would be several orders of magnitude greater than that of the genetic distance between the corresponding parvoviruses. While the effects of negative selection on parvoviruses highly adapted to their animal host may slow further evolution of the virus, it is unlike to account for the discrepancy between host and virus evolution to a significant degree. In comparison, observations on the emergence of canine parvovirus from feline panleukopenia parvovirus [45] and the experimental cross-species infection of rodent parvoviruses provide more support to the role of crossspecies transmission in the evolution of parvoviruses. This would also be more consistent with the degree of recombination seen in diverse parvoviruses [46] , which would have required frequent cross-species transmission and co-infection of different parvoviruses in the same host [47] . The present detection of these partetraviruses in organs of otherwise healthy animals suggests the possibility of viral persistence, although comprehensive sampling of other sites such as the respiratory tract would be needed to exclude acute infections. Relatively little is known about persistence of partetraviruses in animal hosts, although the phenomenon is well-described for other parvoviruses. Genomic DNA of human erythrovirus genotype 1 has been found to persist in the synovial membranes of both patients with chronic arthropathy and healthy individuals [48] . A larger study has additionally uncovered information on the distribution and persistence among different genotypes of human erythrovirus, which revealed the epidemiological history of these genotypes in the human population [49] . The exact mechanism for viral persistence has not been fully elucidated for many parvoviruses, though site-specific integration has been described for adeno-associated viruses [50] . Among the partetraviruses, the phenomenon of persistence is best studied in the human partetravirus genotype PARV4, which has been found in the blood, lymphoid tissue and bone marrow of HIV-infected patients [12, 18] . Results from interferon c enzyme-linked immunospot assays suggested that PARV4 persistence may be present at 26% of hepatitis C virus-positive individuals [51] .",23.306030764065603,12.511198012887284
HCV outbreak investigation commonly requires a much deeper analysis of the infecting viral population,0.2895108978048066,3.173074722290039,2.8330321311950684,171ccd3c-3ab7-44f3-8a23-9f86a8a8e786,comm_use_subset/Advanced Molecular Surveillance of Hepatitis C Virus,"HCV intrahost populations frequently exist as an ensemble of genetically distinct but closely related variants [18, 87] . Analysis of HCV intrahost genetic variation is the basis of genetic relatedness and epidemiological studies as well as the identification of drug resistant mutations [88, 89] . While in some instances genetic relatedness might be demonstrated with consensus sequencing of some viral subgenomic regions, HCV outbreak investigation commonly requires a much deeper analysis of the infecting viral population [16, [90] [91] [92] [93] . The rapidness with which HCV intrahost populations diverge significantly affects genetic relatedness studies because molecular epidemiological links can be lost between related cases in a relatively short period of time ( Figure 3 ) [16, [94] [95] [96] . Therefore, the use of more and longer subgenomic regions, such as the NS3, NS5A, and NS5B might help alleviate this issue. The molecular mechanisms that shaped the evolution of HCV are quite diverse. Upon transmission, HCV undergoes a series of events that affect the architecture of the viral population ( Figure 4) . The ""steps"" taken by HCV throughout the infection process are highly complex and depend on fluctuations in the complexity and size of the intrahost population. HCV transmission events are characterized by genetic bottlenecks that inflict a strong selective pressure during acute infection [56, [97] [98] [99] . Indeed, the HCV genetic bottlenecks are so intense following transmission that very few variants are able to establish infection in the new host [100, 101] . Subsequently, genetic drift commonly takes place as the main force driving the molecular evolution of HCV during the early stages of the acute phase as a result of the strong founder effect [102] [103] [104] . During the later stages of HCV infection the extent of genetic drift is significantly reduced [102] [103] [104] [105] , allowing a large viral population size to come to prominence in chronic cases. To a lesser degree, genetic recombination also affects overall HCV genetic heterogeneity. HCV genetic recombination is rare [106] , mainly due to the exclusion of superinfections [107] [108] [109] . However, despite limited HCV recombination, naturally occurring inter-genotype, intra-genotype, and intra-strain HCV recombinants have been reported [110] [111] [112] [113] . Thus, HCV recombination might have important implications for clinical and epidemiological studies [114] . Staging of HCV infections has also been proposed [115] . This hypothesis suggests that during chronic infection, HCV attempts to reach a settlement stage characterized by a viral population undergoing strong negative selection. This ""journey"" involves complex processes including temporal variations attained by incremental changes between communities, random mutations and fluctuations in the frequency of coexisting viral subpopulations; in conjunction these factors constantly reshape the architecture of the viral population [89, 95, 115, 116] . This staging is likely to affect HCV transmission because different viral variants that most likely possess different degrees of transmissibility are available at different time points during the course of the infection [21] . Despite the complexity of the means used by HCV to evolve in an adverse microenvironment, genetic relatedness can be successfully established in many instances if transmission has occurred relatively recently. In addition to time of infection, establishment of relatedness depends on the degree of divergence and other external factors such as a history of antiviral therapy, which can significantly alter the natural course of HCV evolution.",23.29982299856694,12.058907504263749

We obtained weekly reports of H3N2 incidence in the Netherlands from 1994-2009 by combining influenza-like-illness (ILI) surveillance data with detailed records of associated, laboratory-confirmed cases of flu by type and subtype [29, 30] , and similarly for France and the USA; see Figure 1 and the supplementary online material (Text S1). In addition, we reconstructed the ladder-like phylogeny of H3N2's haemagglutinin gene (HA) from dated European sequences collected in 1968-2009 (see Figure 1 and Text S1). To represent H3N2's global phylodynamics, we focus on a class of spatially structured phylodynamic compartmental models that formalize probabilistically how evolving, antigenic variants interact epidemiologically. These antigenic variants might correspond to the major antigenic clusters that are distinguishable in H3N2 antigenic maps [31] , but can in principle also represent a different phenotypic resolution. The evolutionary dynamics of viral genotypes are separately formulated for each antigenic phenotype because genetic distances do not necessarily easily translate into phenotypic relationships [5] . Spatial substructure has been incorporated in several models of H3N2 phylodynamics to reflect the global circulation of the virus [4, 8, 32] . We adopt here a simple source-sink framework, where the sink is thought of as the Netherlands into which viral genetic diversity and antigenic strains are imported on a seasonal scale from a source population where the virus persists [9, 33] . We fit and assess two distinct models to the combined features of sequence and incidence data described in Figure 1 and Table 1 .

At regions with residual heterozygosity in the MRCAs, experimental mice could have any of the three combinations of the two segregating haplotypes. However, experimental mice will not contain any additional haplotypes not already in the MRCAs.

The larger effective population size, which counters the impact of genetic drift, is a possible explanation for lower evolutionary rates of genotype II. Based on these rate estimates, the TMRCA of this virus is estimated to be between 1868-1891, which is earlier than the first recorded outbreak of ND in Indonesia and England in the 1920's [2] .

Additionally, we observed selection for a synonymous substitution within the polymerase. Since high concentrations of mab 1H3 continued to inhibit the variant virus when given concurrently with infection, mechanisms other than antigenic variation may account for the fitness advantage conferred by these mutations. For example, mutants may have an accelerated replication cycle or more rapid cell entry. Taken together, the development of an in vivo platform for the selection of novel RHDV variants may ultimately lead to the targeted evolution of virus strains to replace current rabbit biocontrol agents.

The observed transcriptome differences can probably be attributed to correlated response to selection [28] or random genetic drift [29] . Correlated selection occurs when a trait is affected by selection on a another trait and is dependent on a genetic correlation between the two traits, which is well known in animal breeding [30] . Alternatively, random genetic drift could contribute to the observed differences, considering that the founder population of the two lines was small [17] .",21.339802240126886,10.696505239782477

Next, populations were merged using a network-based approach. Populations were treated as nodes and two nodes were connected if their genetic distance was under a cutoff value. Populations were grouped in an iterative manner. In each iteration, all maximal cliques (i.e., subsets of nodes that are fully connected to each other) in the network were identified. Maximal cliques represent groups of populations in which all populations have similar allele compositions to each other. Then, mean genetic distance within each clique was calculated. The clique with the lowest average distance was selected and its populations were grouped together. Then, this clique was deleted from the network. Iterations were repeated until no maximal cliques remained in the network. Grouping of populations was carried out using different distance value cutoffs (1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th rank percentile of all distance values).

This partially relieves the deficit of these underrepresented haplotypes in the CC population. For example, chromosome 5 contains a locus between 127Mb and 137Mb where currently only one CC strain has a CAST/ EiJ founder haplotype (Figure 1) Figure 1 ). These areas have a decreased non-domesticus haplotype frequency on the periphery of the n highlighted area, suggesting selection is acting against those particular haplotypes in the CC. The eight founder strains of the CC have been sequenced at high depth, their variants annotated, and their genome recently de novo assembled (Keane et al. 2011; Doran et al. 2016; Lilue et al. 2018) . Previous genetic variation analyses have used sequence from these founders to infer haplotype specific genetic variation in the CC (Durrant et al. 2011; Ferris et al. 2013; Gralinski et al. 2015; Oreper et al. 2017) . By directly sequencing CC strains, we can define founder specific variants across multiple CC strains sharing a founder haplotype at each locus, and identify strain specific variation unique to a CC strain. We first compared the sequenced samples' GigaMUGA genotypes and confirmed that they are consistent with the corresponding MRCA. Next, we queried variation within identical founder haplotype regions at any given locus across the CC to identify de novo mutations. We identified four unique de novo deletions larger than 500bp in the newly sequenced mice that are not present in the assembled reference genome of the CC founders or in the previous cohort of 69 sequenced CC mice (Table 3 ). Figure 2 shows a 19.8kb deletion in CC079/TauUnc that is predicted to delete the Gm14515 gene. The breakpoints were resolved using msBWTs to locally assemble sequence flanking the deletion. A PCR assay was designed to discriminate between the presence or absence of this deletion, and the deletion was fixed in both the MRCA and the three CC079/ TauUnc mice tested.

First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication. In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as ""moderate"" to ""high"" with an average substitution rate being ~10 -4 substitution per year per site [2] , depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel hosts. CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability. Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [70] . Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials. Nevertheless, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts. In addition, mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host [71] . Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate [72] , the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans. Presumably, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels. Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly. Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate. This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome. Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique ""copychoice"" mechanism. In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription. Highly homologous fulllength and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs. Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 [73] .",15.915176222147904,10.659584904012906

An international team led by Yoshi Kawaoka at the Universities of Tokyo and Wisconsin [8] reported a strategy that may potentially allow us to keep one step ahead of the virus. Using random mutagenesis of the viral hemagglutinin together with human immune sera to mimic in vitro the immune selection pressure that occurs in nature, they were able to anticipate which way the virus was likely to evolve, thereby assisting seasonal vaccine strain selection. Separately, Poon and colleagues examined within-host virus genetic diversity when influenza is transmitted in Hong Kong households and demonstrated that multiple virus strains are cotransmitted in the community [9] .

The steadily growing globalization makes it difficult to contain pandemics to a certain region. Therefore, pandemic control is of highest importance to human health. Unfortunately, the segmented nature of the genome of influenza viruses is very conducive for genetic shifts and their rapid spread across various genera augments genetic drift. For example, the human influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were suggested to have been caused by reassorted influenza viruses [1] . Moreover, the H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 has convincingly demonstrated the ability of an avian virus to make the transition from birds to humans directly without going through a perceived ""permissible host"". In particular, the H5N1 virus is believed to have acquired the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 H5N1 and A/teal/ Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, while the internal genes were received from A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 H2N2 or A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, respectively [2] , [3] . Even though this particular strain was eliminated by culling millions of chicken, its ancestors remains circulating in aquatic birds. This paper proposes a new approach to pandemic control by constantly monitoring molecular evolution at both macro level (within the group of viruses) and micro level (within the group of strains) using comparative phyloinformatics. This can facilitate prediction of how these viruses are evolving in terms of spatial, temporal, and host dimensions, and therefore, allows for faster responses to new outbreaks as well as their diagnosis. However, corresponding phylogenetic tree construction algorithms suffer from long runtimes due to their high degrees of computational complexity as well as the large datasets involved. Therefore, it is necessary to develop informatics based solutions that use suitable algorithms and take advantage of distributed computing technologies to make such studies feasible in a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, these solutions need to be integrated in a framework for pandemic control that is biologist-friendly. As a result, effective vaccines and antivirals can be designed more easily and within a shorter response time, since specific local strains can be targeted directly.",18.515128155417766,10.515141947024697

For example, when politicians and community groups in several states in Northern Nigeria ceased supporting polio vaccination in 2003, international diplomacy efforts were undertaken to restart the polio campaign, bringing together the U.S. (with representatives from the State Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other agencies), the United Nations, WHO, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (currently called the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation), the African Union, Bill Gates, vaccine manufacturers, and others. 19 In another example, a broad set of diplomatic actors engaged in a series of formal and informal negotiations with representatives of the Indonesian government when it refused to share H5N1 (avian influenza) virus samples with the Global Influenza Surveillance Network beginning in 2006.

Discovery of pathogens almost exclusively starts with samples from a diseased hosts and not a food matrix. There are many examples of investigations unraveling the etiology of viral outbreaks, but very few where the source of infection is identified or a specific food suspected and tested. It is difficult to establish if an outbreak started as a food contamination event, and it is reasonable to assume that these events are underreported. The small genome sizes of viruses may partly explain why the massive capacity of HTS is rarely used in viral FBP outbreak investigations, as may the limited availability of effective enrichment methods.

Given these promising results, one could consider a more complete rewiring strategy for the 9 kb genome, although it remains a quite elaborate and costly synthetic biology project. Such a holistic approach clearly remains a highrisk procedure as one has to avoid the mutational inactivation of critical replication signals, e.g. the numerous splicing signals (donors, acceptors, enhancers, silencers) or the introduction of toxic signals (e.g. A-addition will frequently introduce stop codons). PIM therefore seems the ideal strategy because all selected mutations have been repeatedly tested and approved in natural isolates. Of course the combination of PIM-assigned changes that are derived from different viruses may still become deleterious, adding to the high-risk. If replication of such a rewired construct is hampered, it would be important to study the interaction of HIV-1 RNA and DNA with components of the innate immune system.

A bigger shift is obtained for A-removal than A-addition, which is related to two simple facts. First, the wt starting sequence contains very many As that can be removed. Second, A-addition calls for a specific mutation (N-to-A), whereas A-removal can be towards any other nucleotide (U, C or G). As expected, a concomitant decrease (Max) and increase (Low and Min) was apparent for the non-A nucleotides, although with a non-random distribution. For instance, -----As were replaced in the Min mutant for G (58×), C (6×) or U (5×). In toto, G-to-A and especially A-to-G changes dominate the mutations chosen, which thus reflects the natural mutational bias of HIV-1 isolates. We believe that this trend is dictated by the characteristics of the codon table. There are eight 4-codon groups where the silent third base can be any nucleotide, but there are also five 2-codon groups where the silent third base change concerns a G/A choice. Another reason for the frequent occurrence of A-to-G over A-to-U/C changes is the observation that transitions are much less frequently observed in HIV-1 evolution than transversions [34, 35] . In fact, we realize that more dramatic silent mutations are possible for the two 6-codon groups, e.g. one could change the CGU codon for Arg silently into AGA and create 2 more As (or remove them in the reversed scenario).

Antigenic drift is a constant process of genetic change naturally occurring as a virus replicates itself. Small imperfections happen as copies are made causing a genetic drift, or slow process of change to occur. Occasionally, an antigenic shift occurs. This is a dramatic reassortment of the genetic structure of the virus when it is combined with other influenza strains and exchanges genetic material (Webster and Govorkova, 2006) . Antigenic shift usually occurs in animals such as swine as they carry both human and animal strains of influenza virus and provide an ideal reservoir for various strains to mix and shift their genetic structure Reperant, et al., 2012.

Reporting influenza-like-illness (ILI) through direct reporting by healthcare providers or through healthcare system reporting can indicate surges in possible cases as well as identify circulating strains. This information can be used to rapidly deploy pharmaceutical interventions and implement social distancing actions. Healthcare providers can report ILI through the U.S. Influenza Sentinel Provider Surveillance Network where the total number of ILI is reported and a number of patient samples are tested for influenza virus for genetic typing. Syndromic surveillance systems such as Biosense and ESSENCE can indicate emergency department utilization for ILI and assist monitoring for impact. Viral surveillance can also indicate the incidence of antiviral resistance.

The triggering event in these evolutionary episodes is reproduction with genetic variation. Then positive and negative selection, together with random sampling (drift) that take place within a host, or between host individuals, shape the genetic composition of the virus. Reproductive success can be quantified as relative fitness values (Quiñones-Mateu and Arts, this volume) or with epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproductive rate (or ratio) (Ro), defined as the average number of secondary cases resulting from the introduction of a single infected case into a susceptible population. Ro is a general parameter (which can be applied to demography of any type of biological entity) that can predict the long-term epidemic spread of a pathogenic agent (reviews concerning application to viral infections in May 2000 and Woolhouse 2004 ). Both fitness and Ro values capture average values of fundamentally heterogeneous entities, and such averages may vary as an infection progresses or an epidemic spreads, thus adding an additional level of complexity to the interpretation of the reproductive success of a virus.

It is possible that they shape the genome at least in terms of the diversity of strains found worldwide as well as contribute to virulence evolution. Phylogenic analysis of the phage integrase gene showed a pattern of biogeographic separation. This is in agreement with a model of co-evolution between the virus and its bacterial host since biogeographic separation is also observed within H. pylori. A model of geographically constrained viral dispersal also fits, i.e. H. pylori from different geographical regions may have been infected by distinct phage lineages after the geographic separation of the bacterial host. Another hypothesis could be that after bacterial infection with the virus, the divergence of the bacterium is also accompanied by divergence of the integrated virus. It has been argued that H. acinonychis strain Sheeba is derived from H. pylori and that the prophage was acquired after the host jump from human to feline. An equally likely scenario is that the prophage was present in the bacterial genome before the host jump. There is ample evidence for continued exchange of genetic material between phages, bacterial genomes, and various other genetic elements. This explains the sometimes fuzzy distinction between phages, plasmids and pathogenicity islands (PAI), and the chimerical nature of some phage genomes. The origin of the cag PAI is currently unknown. An exciting hypothesis would be that cagPAI as well as newly described plasticity zones, which are being considered increasingly as true PAIs, have a phage origin.",20.129967194027547,11.14933956208765

Drug treatment is often the default approach used to control emergent bacterial and fungal diseases, but in some cases a single new drug can cause strong natural selection, and, combined with the high evolutionary potential of pathogens, this means that the expected time until drug resistance evolves can be short (Fisher et al., 2018; Kennedy and Read, 2018) . For such scenarios, we need to develop evolution-aware strategies to avoid and control emergent diseases. For example, in the case of chemical treatments, combination therapy or the sequential application of different drugs can delay resistance evolution (Palmer and Kishony, 2013; Roemhild et al., 2018) , and the development of 'evolution-proof' drugs is a particularly attractive idea (Bell and MacLean, 2018) .

This constraint comes partially from intrinsic selective forces that limit virus evolution, such as selection for modulation of pathogenicity to the host, and the structural constraints of the virus itself. Other major constraints on virus evolution come from the diverse immune strategies imposed by hosts.

The number of available reagents for use in hamster models right now is not where it needs to be for sufficient insight into how these animals are protected from or develop disease ( Table 3) . As of now, the best methods for immunological assays in hamsters are qRT-PCR for detection of expression of immune-related genes and ELISA for the detection of humoral immune responses. Despite being used as an animal model for decades, immunological tools for hamsters remains years behind other animal models such as mice, rats, and non-human primates. For the full potential of hamsters as an appropriate disease model to be realized, developing of many different hamster-specific tools for assays that are specific to hamsters need to be created. Falcinelli et al. (2015) The use of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies against immune markers and cytokines from other species has given researchers using hamsters a viable option for certain assays, but the development of monoclonal antibodies that are hamster-specific for a variety of immune cell surface markers and cytokines would greatly improve upon the current state of immunological assays done in hamster models. The production of hamster-specific monoclonal antibodies against common immune markers and cytokines should be number one on the wish list of anyone doing immunological assays with hamsters.

A broad array of empirical research questions in evolution education requires the use of measurement instruments designed to capture latent constructs, such as students' knowledge of macroevolution or their belief in evolution. In recent years, some science educators have raised concerns about the quality of extant instruments used in science education research in general and evolution education in particular (Nehm 2006 ; Smith 2010 ; Neumann et al. 2011 ) . It is critically important that the evolution education research community develops and deploys high-quality instruments that are in alignment with professional measurement standards (i.e., AERA et al. 1999 ) . Otherwise, the measures derived from such instruments will have little meaning, or, more problematically, they may mislead educators in their efforts to improve the teaching and learning of core scientifi c topics such as evolution. Instruments about macroevolution are no exception. Nadelson and Southerland ( 2010a , b ) developed the fi rst instrument designed to measure students' knowledge of macroevolution. 10 Several compelling reasons justifi ed the development of this instrument. First, school and university students (and the general public) appear to have different levels of acceptance relating to microevolutionary and macroevolutionary change. Second, many science curricula and textbooks distinguish microevolution and macroevolution as distinct instructional topics (e.g., Stanley 1980 ) . Third, understanding microevolutionary processes (i.e., natural selection and genetic drift) may not translate into an understanding of, for example, larger scale phenomena, such as the formation of new species or evolutionary trends (Catley 2006 ) . Fourth, Nadelson and Southerland ( 2010a , b ) argue that natural selection and adaptation are primarily microevolutionary, and not macroevolutionary, concepts (contrary to the views of some, see above and Table 14 .1 ). Thus, despite several microevolutionary knowledge measures (e.g., Settlage and Odom 1995 ) , a distinct measure of macroevolutionary knowledge appeared to be justifi ed. Given the controversies in the HPS literature about how macroevolution should be conceptualized, to what extent does Nadelson and Southerland's ( 2010a , b ) construct of ""macroevolution"" align with HPS perspectives?",21.218396140277,8.59555417309092

It may be that the mutation rates are normally so high in RNA viruses (at between 10 −6 and 10 −4 mutations per nucleotide per cell infection 72 ) and the population sizes often so large (both within hosts and at the epidemiological scale) that advantageous combinations of mutations are regularly generated without the assistance of recombination.",18.423264519346993,8.06168076951368

In contrast, countries that did not apply blanket vaccination for H5N1 control, such as Japan and Korea, have not had the virus establish endemically (Sugiura et al., 2009) .

Population genetic theory shows that variation will be lost by genetic drift with an almost clocklike regularity (Wright, 1969) . In closed populations, in the absence of factors promoting genetic variation (mutation and gene flow) the expected rate of loss of heterozygosity, or rate of loss of genetic variance in quantitative characters or selectively neutral variation, is 1/2N e per generation. Little variation is lost in any one generation but small N sustained for several generations can severely deplete variability. Most variability is lost within 2N e generations. An effective population of 10 is predicted to lose heterozygotes five times faster than a population of effective size 100; 50% of its heterozygosity will be lost in approximately 20 generations. Therefore, in theory, small isolated populations have a higher rate of loss of heterozygosity and are expected to have lower levels of genetic variation than large continuously distributed populations. Because variability is inherently related to evolvability, genetic erosion in small, recently fragmented populations may contribute to their endangerment. Barrett and Kohn (1991) and Young et al. (1996) review the growing literature of the population genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation for plants. There are numerous examples of a positive relationship between N e and population genetic variation at allozyme loci for remnant populations. Ouberg and colleagues conducted experimental investigations of genetic erosion with Scabiosa columbaria and Salvia pratensis plants under common garden conditions and found positive correlations between variance for adaptive traits related to growth rates and population size.

This is because the strength of drift depends on the effective population size, not on the census size. Demographical bottlenecks have a strong and long-lasting effect on effective population sizes, and such bottlenecks occur extensively during inter-host transmission in nearly all viruses. The size of the founder population following inter-host transmission has been estimated using genetic markers, and is typically lower than 10 genome copies. This number, though, can vary widely depending on transmission route (aerosol, fecal-oral, sexual, insect-borne, etc.) . Additionally, viral infections show extensive intra-host spatial structure caused by restrictions to viral trafficking among tissues or organs (organ compartmentalization) as well as by the limited diffusion of virions in the extracellular milieu (localized infection foci). Spatial structure also reduces effective population sizes, hence promoting drift. The immediate consequence of drift is the loss of genetic diversity, because only a subset of the population contributes to the next generation. A longer-term consequence is the random fixation of alleles in the population. In highly variable populations such as those of RNA viruses and at sufficiently low population sizes, drift can result in the loss of the wild-type sequence. In the absence of back mutation or recombination, this loss is irreversible and hence leads to the accumulation of random mutations in the population, most of which are neutral or deleterious. This process, known as Muller´s ratchet, reduces mean population fitness and can endanger the survival of small RNA virus populations.",26.23936038786312,12.284752662489304

Shift evolution occurs through reassortment, the mixing of two influenza viruses (e.g., avian influenza and human influenza) into a new strain that carries properties from both strains.

These limited places of acceptable variation have been called covarions (Fitch, 1971) .

An interesting and often-cited case involves the repeated release of the myxoma poxvirus in Europe and Australia as a form of biological control over invasive European rabbit populations [50] . Historically, this virus was known to cause mild disease in South American rabbits, but was found to be lethal to European rabbits. However, after release into European rabbit populations, the emergence of less virulent viral forms quickly followed. Attenuation of viral pathogenicity resulted in increased rabbit survival times, which may have optimized viral transmission to new rabbits through insect vectors. Rabbit populations also adapted to widespread exposure to myxoma virus, but not to the level observed in rabbit species from South America. While this is as an illustrious example of host-virus co-evolution, the mutations underlying adaptation have not yet been identified. It will be challenging to determine which specific mutational changes conveyed the observed fitness improvements, as a majority of the mutations that accumulated in host and virus genomes are predicted to have been evolutionarily neutral or even slightly deleterious. This limitation pertains to most experiments that involve sampling from infection dynamics unfolding in nature, and can be especially vexing in highly heterogeneous virus populations and for protocols with sparse sampling.

The tree has a main trunk with branching points representing drifting strains that become extinct in an approximately one-year period. This type of topology likely results from the continuous emergence of new virus variants that can evade recognition by the immune system through a change in the properties of their antigenic sites. In the case of influenza the renew of susceptibles comes from births of new hosts and from regained susceptibility of previously infected individuals to new influenza variants. The short infectious periods of influenza, together with its high genetic variation, leads to a rapid strain turnover, probably one of the reasons producing the strong seasonality of influenza epidemics. An unresolved question concerns the transmission mode of influenza through respiratory droplets containing just one or a few viral particles. This strong reduction in population size could lead to the fixation of mutations during optimization of the virus inside each particular host. The expected result should be a very high diversity among lineages (infecting different hosts) that is not observed in natural populations of the virus. Mathematical models of influenza epidemics have approached this question by taking into account the balance between the production of new strains and the competition-induced stochastic extinction of existing variants. The results obtained show that, if cross-immunity is the only form of competition between strains, there is an exponential growth of diversity. However, if a short-lived immunity that inhibits reinfection by any new strain during a short time is considered in the model, the probability of explosive diversity growth is strongly reduced [64, 126] .",20.18688946609017,10.513518162325132

This dynamic interplay between hosts and viruses is difficult to recapitulate in laboratory-based studies that employ a single viral clone infecting an isogenic host population. In cases where resistance is conveyed by a dominant genetic factor, as would be the case with a cellular restriction factor or other immunity protein, the genetic basis for resistance can be uncovered by performing the illustrated screen. A cDNA library prepared from the resistant cell line is introduced into the susceptible cell line. The resulting cells are screened for a cDNA clone that conveys resistance. This scheme was used to identify the HIV restriction factor, TRIM5α [5] . B) Once cellular immunity proteins have been identified, heterologous gene studies can also be used to finely map the genetic determinants of viral recognition. In this case, multiple orthologs of the gene of interest (here, ""gene X"") from related species will be required. These orthologous genes are introduced into a common cell background, and these cells are then tested for susceptibility or resistance to the virus of interest. Phenotypic differences can be compared to the genotypes of each ortholog as shown on the top right, where black tick marks indicate mutational differences compared to the top blue ortholog of species 1.

For instance, most research on the human hepatitis C virus was historically performed in chimpanzees, because this virus was not easily studied in tissue culture. B) Sometimes cell lines from heterologous species are used in tissue culture-based virology experiments. In cases where incompatibility is observed between a virus and a cell line of a heterologous species, this presents an opportunity to identify cellular barriers to infection in a genetically tractable system (see Figure 2 ). C) It is becoming more common to express single genes from one species in cell lines derived from a second species. This allows one to study the significance of genetic divergence at a single host locus with regards to viral replication. Also, in such systems viral evolution experiments elucidate how a virus can escape specific cellular blocks. New diseases arise when existing viruses acquire novel hosts. This diagram illustrates the steps by which a virus is transmitted from its original host to a new host species. While all organisms are continuously exposed to the viruses of other species, infection resulting in virus replication and potentially illness (step 1) is thought to be a relatively rare event. Rarer still will be infections that are successful enough to transmit between individuals in the new host species (step 2). Of these, only some will progress to the point of epidemic or pandemic spread through the new host species (step 3). In theory, each of these steps may or may not require the acquisition of novel mutations in the viral genome, although existing evidence suggests that additional mutations usually do accumulate in viral genomes as viruses become more and more adapted to a particular host. Virus mutations can be acquired through point mutation, insertion, deletion, recombination, or reassortment. The acquisition of combinations of mutations may be required for viruses to advance through this process. Figure adapted in part from [55] .",18.862184231919805,10.462803106412258

Ubiquitin vinylsulfone (Ub-VS) was first synthesized to specifically label ubiquitin specific DUBs (140) , This reagent reacts specifically with the active site of DUBs where the catalytic thiol can react with the electrophile to covalently label the DUB. If the UBL also contains an epitope tag the labeling can be detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and is thus useful to inventory the complement of DUBs present in lysates or crude extracts (22) . These reagents show little or no reactivity with other proteins since the electrophiles used are not very reactive and require a suitable nucleophile nearby before crosslinking can occur. Thus, incubation with low levels of UBL-X for a few minutes is sufficient to label many DUBs, These reagents must be used with caution however, since incubations with large amounts of the UBL-X reagent or longer reaction times can result in spurious labeling of DUBs that actually prefer another UBL. Both the identity of the UBL domain and the nature of the electrophile determine the specificity of this reaction (22) , demonstrating that DUBs have significant specificity for the UBL domain (Ub vs. Nedd8 vs. ISG15, etc.) and that differences in the active site environment can be exploited to develop DUB specific reagents.

The white-winged warbler was long considered just one of many species of warbler . . . however, use of DNA data and the Tree of Life showed it was not a true warbler (Fig. 5 .7) (Klein et al., 2004) .

By building a phylogenetic tree, they found that a single dominant lineage persisted through time. Red symbols indicate several important recent strains. The tree in (A) shows the evolution of the HA1 domain from 1983 through 1994. Part (B) contains isolates from 1983 through 1997. In (B), the authors collapsed many branches of the tree for which they lacked strong support.

Future directions to control the spread of the disease Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 are required to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. A guideline was published for the medical staff, healthcare providers, and, public health individuals and researchers who are interested in the 2019-nCoV [29] . The early death cases of COVID-19 outbreak occurred primarily in elderly people, possibly due to a weak immune system that permits faster progression of viral infection [8, 12] . The public services and facilities should provide decontaminating reagents for cleaning hands on a routine basis. Physical contact with wet and contaminated objects should be considered in dealing with the virus, especially agents such as faecal and urine samples that can potentially serve as an alternative route of transmission [15, 16] . China and other countries including the US have implemented major prevention and control measures including travel screenings to control further spread of the virus [13] . Epidemiological changes in COVID-19 infection should be monitored taking into account potential routes of transmission and subclinical infections, in addition to the adaptation, evolution, and virus spread among humans and possible intermediate animals and reservoirs. There remains a considerable number of questions that need to be addressed. These include, but are not limited to, details about who and how many have been tested, what proportion of these turned positive and whether this rate remains constant or variable. Very few paediatric cases have so far been reported; is this due to lack of testing or a true lack of infection/susceptibility? Of the ones that have so far been tested, how many have developed severe disease and how many were tested positive but showed no clinical sign of disease?

It has been postulated that if ever ZEBOV would cause an outbreak of significant size in a densely populated urban environment, the evolution towards an airborne variant could occur. Specifically, the argument has been put forward that a large enough epidemic would provide sufficient evolutionary pressure to the virus to give rise to an airborne variant. Since there is some evidence that REBOV infections may be airborne, a variant with an intrinsically high mutation rate could evolve towards an airborne virus. In general, RNA viruses encode error-prone polymerases that lack proofreading mechanisms, allowing these viruses to mutate and evolve under the appropriate selection pressures. It has been hypothesized that MARV strains that were involved in the DRC and Angola outbreaks in 1998 and 2004 respectively, were more virulent than the strains involved in the outbreak in Germany in 1967. Analysing the nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein gene of both MARV and EBOV from different outbreaks indicates however that isolates from the same outbreak are almost identical in nucleotide sequences, whereas viruses recovered from different outbreaks may vary up to 20%, the majority of the mutations being silent . The genetic stability observed during the Angolan outbreak of MARV infection indicates that the outbreak was probably caused by a single introduction of the virus by one index case, followed by spread to community members and further amplification by nosocomial transmission . This sequence of events may explain the relatively limited accumulation of mutations observed during this outbreak. In contrast, the MARV outbreak of 1998 was characterized by circulation of multiple genetic lineages, as well as identical lineages within, but not across clusters of epidemiologically linked cases. This suggested that multiple introductions of MARV in the community had ",13.886372117432655,7.543116203826115

Obviously such genetic exchange requires coreplication of two or more strains within the same cell. The most likely coinfection environment where segment reassortment occurs is within ticks, where lasting virus infections persists for extended periods and superinfection with a second strain, during the strict requirement for blood meals, is very likely [28] . Given the currently available data on the low rate of recombination in CCHFV, and particularly the fact that the rate of recombination seems lower than general genetic drift, it appears that reassortment plays the most contributory role to the variability and flexibility of the CCHFV genome. Indeed, the low rate of recombination in negative-strand RNA viruses generally has led to suggestions that genome segmentation and reassortment have evolved to increase their fitness for survival [7, 31] . Specifically, while the high mutation rates of RNA viruses provide the raw material for evolutionary processes [21] , mutations also introduce fitness compromising deleterious effects [6] . Genetic exchange through recombination or reassortment are recognized as adaptive methods of purging such effects [5, 27] , thus in the practical absence of recombination, reassortment is able to take up the reins. In addition, reassortment enables alternative virus genotypes to be selected from a pool of functional segments. The current evidence of reassortment in CCHFV [3, 8, 14] points principally to the exchange of M segments between viruses in mixed infections. In addition, the majority of data on L and S sequences show that in many cases these segments have evolved together as partners. Thus, in mixed virus infections where reassortment is a possibility, partner L and S segments have a propensity to end up in the same virus particle (due to the ostensibly strong interrelationships between the nuclear protein and RdRp) in order to constitute a viable new virus [3] . Some exceptions to this idea have been exposed by the availability of more sequences [8] , and while it is clear that L and S segments trees are not analogous, they remain highly similar. M segments on the other hand seem to be more autonomous and could result in new virus phenotypes. Thus, as CCHFV are dispersed and introduced into new areas in which they are already endemic, the emergence of new CCHFV would principally be the result of M segment reassortment. Glycoprotein spikes encoded by M segments are well known for their ability to influence host range and cellular tropism [11, 41] , furthermore, they are often associated with altered pathogenicity. These mechanisms, together with the likely contact and infection of new hosts, provide a foundation for the appearance of new CCHF disease and the emergence of new viruses [17] .",24.182291710611583,12.185728799782932

This type of EC might be particularly applicable to some viruses, such as influenza virus, which is transmitted directly through respiratory fluids and/or fecal matter and is capable of circulating in a wide range of mammalian and avian species [24] . Most human influenza infections tend to resolve over the course of days, but sometimes they are chronic. Such chronically infected hosts might sometimes be able to generate genetically unique forms of viruses [25] . Only recently have the tools become precise enough to reveal genetic differentiation of viruses within single hosts, and for influenza virus, as many as ten variants per individual human infection have been observed [26] . The high mutation rate of influenza virus (and perhaps other RNA viruses), as well as their capacity to share nucleic acids horizontally (when the same host cells are coinfected by different strains; [24] ), could enable some hosts to facilitate parasite evolution. Although most such variants will be eliminated before transmission because of strong purifying selection, genetic drift, bottleneck effects, and elimination by the host immune system, some few could manifest new forms of virulence or propensities to infect novel host cell types (via sialic acid receptors). It is too soon to know whether superevolvers are common, much less if they impact global infection dynamics [25] .

Particularly in regions of the Far East where living conditions are often in close proximity to avian and swine populations, the risk for human acquisition of recombined influenza viruses with increased pathogenic potential is real. Indeed, of the influenza A isolates sequenced, all were found to be closely related to the Fujian strain (Fig. 1) , which was the predominant influenza strain seen globally in the subsequent 2003/2004 influenza season but was not covered by the 2003/2004 influenza vaccine preparation. 10, 11 A weakness of this surveillance was lack of data indicating the percentage capture of those meeting the case definition. Given the great concern over SARS transmission, however, we are confident that capture of FRI was better than it would have been in years without this concern. In addition, the surveillance period was relatively short, indicating that individuals in the presymptomatic stages of infection likely came back to the United States. Given this risk, real-time knowledge of pathogens in circulation would be useful. To this end, field implementation of diagnostic technologies, such as classic PCR or real-time PCR methods (such as with the LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana), would be a valuable addition to surveillance such as this in remote regions.",16.490938151014156,10.85898249094318

INTRODUCTION AND STUDIES IN MICE,"An excellent demonstration of the role of resistance to spread of the virus is presented in the paper by . It is remembered from Section VII1,A that mouse strains tested in embryo tissue culture may be shown to carry a gene for resistance to propagation of the leukemia virus, and dependent upon whether the virus is of the Nor Btropic type, have either the allele FV-1"" or FV-lb. Since most of the AKR mice carry the Ntropic virus, it was possible to analyze the effect of FV-lb (which produces resistance to propagation of the Ntropic viruses) on the spontaneous appearance of leukemia virus by making crosses of AKR mice with low leukemia strains which carry the gene FV-lb instead of FV-l"", as was done in the previous analysis. Some of the results of these crosses, as reproduced from their paper, are presented in Fig. 8 . The marked reduction in the number of mice of the F1 generation that had virus present at two weeks of age and the ocurrence of mice that did not show any virus at six to ten weeks was apparently a reflection of this resistance to propagation (Fig. 8 ) . Furthermore, in the backcrosses there were very few mice that had significant amounts of virus a t two or six weeks, in direct contrast with the backcrosses between AKR and low leukemia strain mice with the permissive gene FV-I"", That the FV-1 gene is acting by suppression of the ability of the virus to propagate in susceptible tissues, and not acting on the actual spontaneous occurrence of the virus, was nicely demonstrated by induction of virus by means of 5-iododeoxyuridine in tissue cultures of the appropriate generations and crosses. The presence of virus in the induced cells was tested by co-cultivation with susceptible cells immediately after induction and then determining the presence of virus. Thus it was shown that the presence of FV-1 had no influence on the evolution of the virus, but, as shown above, prevented the spread within the animal. The apparent Mendelian inheritance of the gs antigen for chicken leukemia, in some cases of the mammary tumor agent, and of several different manifestations of mouse leukemia has now been demonstrated. The nature of the integration of the virus with the host genetic material has, however, not been clarified. The main purpose of Rowe and Hartley's investigation was to determine whether the virus released from the hybrids had the characteristics of the various hybrid hosts from which it was actually released, or whether it was like that of the dominant parent, the AKR mouse. Since viruses that cause leukemia in mice may be divided into two main classes, N tropic and B tropic, and since a cross between AKR mice (which carry N-tropic viruses) and various FV-lb low-leukemia mice (which carry B-tropic agents) had been made, it was then important to determine the host range of the virus which appeared in this set of hybrids. The host range of this virus was almost always that of the AKR mice, which was interpreted by Rowe and Hartley as strong evidence that the virus-inducing genetic loci of the AKR mice contained the mouse leukemia virus genetic loci and not that the agent was derived directly from the host.",17.26087070635101,9.249468020557357

The influence of these mechanisms in the diverse communities that were mobilized and then became isolated, as well as severe external factors such as epidemics, caused successive genetic bottlenecks in populations (see Figure 1 in main text) [90] . Human evolutionary studies are currently considered under 'modern synthesis', which merges Darwin's ideas of natural selection with theoretical population genetics and Mendelian principles, stating that evolution occurs via small genetic changes that are regulated by natural selection [91] . These beneficial adaptations subsequently expand within the members of a population and become evident in the ancestral specificity and the geographical distribution of the advantageous alleles in the genomes of contemporary humans. Genetic bottlenecks occur when the number of individuals in a population is reduced drastically due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake, a flood, a famine, or the outbreak of an infectious disease. These events limit the genetic variation of a population and can lead to genetic drift. As a result, a smaller population, with a correspondingly reduced genetic diversity, remains to transmit genes to future generations through sexual reproduction. Even if this reduction in the genetic diversity is temporary, it can lead to long-lasting effects on the genetic variation of the offspring populations. Genetic drift: changes in the allele frequencies of a population over generations due to chance. Genetic locus: fixed position on a chromosome (e.g., the position of a gene or a genetic marker). Histocompatibility complex: region of approximately 4000 kb, located on human chromosome 6, that contains a large number of genes whose products are expressed as proteins on immune cells. Of these genes, the best known are HLA genes. Introgressive hybridization: incorporation of genes from one species into the genetic reserves of another by interspecific hybridization and backcrossing with the parent species. present a high frequency of Hemoglobin-C (HBC) in their populations, which is associated with a 30-93% decrease in the possibility of developing the disease [10] . This is also the case for the Duffy antigen receptor gene (DARC) in erythrocytes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which have been associated with protection against Plasmodium vivax malaria in certain areas of Africa where this disease is endemic [11, 12] . Another example of natural selection driven by evolutionary pressure for protection against malaria are thalassemia (a and b) pathologies, a group of hemoglobin disorders that presents an incidence of up to 30% among communities of West Africa [13] . The human CASP12 T 125 C SNP, expression of which is restricted to the African subcontinent, South America, and certain areas of Asia, can modulate immune and inflammatory responses to malaria by antagonizing interleukin (IL)-1b and NF-kB signaling in innate immune cells; moreover, caspase 12-deficient mice (Casp12 -/-) exhibit decreased interferon (IFN)-g production and clearance of the parasite, relative to wild type (WT) infected mice [14] . However, others have questioned these findings, given that caspase 12-deficient mice also lack caspase 11 expression, so the effects observed might not be specific to caspase 12 [15] .",29.79250085687194,13.900957388852474

The combination of the selective pressure caused by infectious diseases with other evolutionarily relevant processes, such as genetic drift, migratory events, bottlenecks, and introgressive hybridization, contribute to driving the expansion, fixation, or elimination of characteristic immune response-related traits in different populations around the world. These specific genetic variants are able to boost the host response against pathogens by improving the sensing of microbial ligands but can also lead to the development of autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system responds to endogenous ligands and induces abnormal responses targeted against the host's own tissues. Of note, it is very difficult to assign certain variants, a specific role in the protection or induction of autoimmunity. To assign changes in the genetic landscape of human populations to certain diseases is an extraordinary challenge. Moreover, our species is in constant evolutionary interaction with various microorganisms and viruses. Populations of bacteria and their viruses (phages) undergo, under natural conditions, reciprocal evolution in terms of resistance and infection; this, in turn, also affects the evolutionary traits of our immune system.

SeqTrack [38] utilizes the fact that in the absence of recombination and reverse mutations, strains will have unique ancestors characterized by the fewest possible mutations, no sample can be the ancestor of a sample which temporally preceded it, and the likelihood of ancestry can be estimated from the genomic differentiation between samples. SeqTrack was successful in reconstructing the transmission trees in both completely and incompletely sampled outbreaks unlike phylogenetic approaches, which failed to capture ancestral relationships between the tips of trees.

One way of changing is called antigenic drift, which is a gradual process whereby the virus adaptively mutates to increase the capability of binding to human cells during subsequent human infections. These small, but important, mutations in the surface proteins of the influenza virus require the flu vaccine to be re-formulated on an annual basis. In a typical year, seasonal influenza causes widespread illness and approximately 30,000 deaths in the United States alone. These seasonal influenza epidemics are caused by slight mutations in the influenza virus. During these outbreaks, people may have some residual immunity from exposure to previously circulating influenza strains or cross-subtype immunity from seasonal influenza vaccinations. 6 Another way the influenza virus can change is called antigenic shift or reassortment, which is an abrupt, major change in the influenza virus. Dramatic changes in the surface proteins of the influenza virus, through mutation of nonhuman (e.g., avian or swine) viruses or reassortment of human and nonhuman viruses, result in the creation of a new human subtype or a protein combination that has not been seen in humans for many years. Pandemic influenza can cause a public health crisis because most people would be immunologically naïve to the new virus. 7 In order for a pandemic to occur, three elements must be present. First, an influenza virus must emerge from an animal reservoir and engage in a reassortment event with a human influenza virus. Genetic material can be exchanged between human and avian or swine viruses during coinfection of a human, bird, or pig. Second, the novel virus must actually make humans sick. Reassortment events occur frequently, yet most do not yield pathogenic viruses. Third, the virus must be fully transmissible from human to human-spread easily through coughing, sneezing, or a handshake. If all three elements are present, the public is at great risk in facing a new and potentially deadly virus that is easily transmissible.",17.964167916380507,10.21182317064315

Consider the impact of genes of major effect in order to determine experimental design and/or select a subset of lines. For many pathogens, host genes or loci, e.g., MHC [41, 42] , that exert major effects on control of viral disease have already been identified, e.g., Cmv1 for cytomegalovirus, Oas1b for flaviviruses, Mx1 for influenza, and CCR5 for HIV. Furthermore, for Oas1b [39] and Mx1 [38] , there are both functional and nonfunctional variants segregating within the CC. Using the genetic sequence information available for CC-RIs, experimenters may wish to exclude specific lines from their experimental population. For example, a researcher interested in identifying genetic variants that enhance lung damage during influenza A virus infection might wish to exclude lines with a functional Mx1 from their study. An analogous approach deals with those cases where reagents required to properly assess disease responses are genotypesensitive or genotype-specific. One example includes a specific viral peptide or tetramer with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype restriction. In this case, although CC lines with (e.g.) a C57BL/6J MHC haplotype should generate robust disease response data, CC lines with other founder haplotypes at the MHC locus might not be compatible with the reagent, and therefore accurate assessments of the antiviral states of these lines will not be possible. Thus, exclusion of specific lines, stratified analysis of all lines, or alternative experimental designs may be needed to address these issues. In both of these cases, the best approach to identify specific lines is to examine the founder-strain haplotypes at the genes/loci of interest. The CC status website (http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py) contains a variety of tools, reviewed in ref. [28] , with which researchers can identify and visualize the haplotypes present in all available CC lines at given loci. In this way, specific lines can be identified, and subsequently included or excluded, based on the investigator's desired and required haplotypes. We note that while the DO might provide a greater number of genetically unique individuals for a study, the outbred nature of the DO and not being able to preselect animals with given haplotypes from the DO before purchase might strongly affect the ability to assess phenotypic variation if these haplotype-specific reagents and/or genes of major effect are present.",17.77457805191309,9.24297156632136

As illustrated in Figure 6 , each individual character or phenotype can be viewed as having fitness effects that are typically greatest in one dimension only (i.e., for one or a few replicative functions). The net evolutionary effect, however, is a composite of a particular trait's influence on fitness in an aggregate adaptive landscape that takes into account the combined relative survival and Fig. 6 . Differential phenotype fitness values with respect to functions of viral reproduction. Every phenotype is expected to have one (or a few) functions for which its fitness is highest. reproduction probabilities of the characters. Movement through these landscapes may be facilitated by the potential for high genetic drift of some viruses especially due to random sampling of genotypes during transmission (Domingo et al., 1985; Gebauer et al., 1988) . Also, high mutation rates of many RNA viruses may likewise hasten ascension of adaptive peaks (Eigen and Biebricher, 1988) . However, landscapes are not static; they are perpetually shifting through evolutionary time, and this will promote movement to (and subsequent movement up) optimal peaks. Transformation of the topography is driven by abiotic (environmental) variation, viral evolutionary change, and by host evolution, including responses to these changes.",18.635916145324778,10.992891292858149

Following a drastic reduction in population size, the probability of fixation of deleterious mutations (which occur with much higher frequency than advantageous ones) is enhanced by the improbability of subsequent reversions (Haigh, 1978; Chao, 1991) and a lack of restorative mechanisms (Muller, 1964) . This is termed ""Muller's ratchet"" since mutations in subsequent (colonizing) populations are accumulated in an irreversible fashion similar to the advance of a ratchet (Muller, 1964) . The end-result is a decrease in fitness caused by an increasing mutational load, and this has been observed in numerous viral systems in vitro. Significant fitness decreases following plaque-toplaque transfers (bottlenecks) have been demonstrated for VSV (Duarte et al., 1992 (Duarte et al., , 1993 , RNA phage ~6 (Chao, 1990; Chao et al., 1992) , FMDV , as well as in the DNA-based cellular microorganism, Salmonella typhimurium (Andersson and Hughes, 1996) . Viral bottlenecks occurring in nature have been investigated to a limited extent (see Domingo et al., 1985; Gebauer et al., 1988) , but their frequency is most likely common during certain host-host transmission events and intrahost colonization of secondary replication sites Domingo et al., 1996) . In viruses susceptible to the effects of Muller's ratchet due to transmission dynamics or other aspects of their host colonization biology, genetic exchanges via recombination and reassortment may represent a ""buffer"" that prevents population fitness loss due to an otherwise extensive accumulation of deleterious mutations. This mechanistic ""relief valve"" has been suggested as a selective determinant supporting the evolution and maintenance of genetic exchange in RNA viruses by Chao (1991 Chao ( , 1992 and Chao and colleagues (1992) .",23.829029426324798,10.973826123150141

But this maintenance can only exist under conditions in which mutation rates are below a threshold that is determined to a large extent by relative transmission advantages (i.e., interhost selection) of the new mutant versus its ancestral population. The authors show that at the intrahost level mutants defective for the ""unselfish"" character are selectively neutral and thus will drift to fixation at a rate approximately equal to the rate of production of such mutants.

The mature virus particles are triple layered, approximately 70 nm in diameter, and possess icosahedral symmetry. The rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA that code for 6 structural viral proteins and 6 non-structural proteins. Of the non-structural proteins, NSP4 is of particular interest, since it has enterotoxin-like activity and can induce diarrhea in mice. The classification of rotavirus into 7 different groups (A-G) is based on the antigenic specificity of the VP6 capsid proteins. Of the 7 groups, only groups A, B and C are known to infect humans. Severe, life-threatening disease in children worldwide is caused predominantly by group A rotaviruses. Variability in the genes encoding the two outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 form the basis of the current strain typing of group A rotaviruses into G and P genotypes respectively. All known G serotypes correspond with genotypes; more P genotypes than serotypes have been identified. At least 15 G genotypes and >30 P genotypes have been identified to date. The strains most commonly reported include G1P , and more recently G12 strains in combination with different P types. Unusual G and P types have been reported from different parts of the world. The temporal changes in circulating strains and the rapid evolution of rotaviruses by a variety of mechanisms provide challenges in epidemiological studies. These mechanisms of evolution include genetic drift, wherein accumulation of point mutations generates genetic lineages leading to the emergence of antibody escape mutants, and genetic shift through gene reassortment during dual infection of a single cell. Hence methods of virus typing need to be regularly monitored and updated to identify emerging novel strains of epidemiological importance (Parashar et al., 2013) .",22.46762359978782,11.743893513030901
we are currently working on isolating new PEDV variants that can grow in cell culture,0.19016937194723182,3.503618001937866,3.8149843215942383,36547d40-8be1-4b69-a506-c7f554c5f585,"custom_license/Complete genome sequences of novel S-deletion variants of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus identified from a recurrent outbreak on Jeju Island, South Korea","This is the first report describing the complete genome sequences of novel PEDV S-DEL variants on the Jeju Island, where PEDV outbreaks have occurred repeatedly since a large-scale re-emergence in 2014. The S glycoprotein is functionally divided into two domains, S1 and S2, each of which plays an independent role in coronavirus entry by mediating receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively [5] [6] [7] . Several studies have shown that mutations, including substitutions and insertions/deletions (INDELs), in the S gene affect viral pathogenicity and host tropism [3, 6, 14] . A number of novel G2b variants with unique large or small S-INDELs have been reported in several countries that experienced the 2013-2014 PED [2, 3, 11, 16, 17] . To investigate this hypothesis, we are currently working on isolating new PEDV variants that can grow in cell culture, the development of which will allow us to perform a challenge study. However, it is anticipated that the pathogenicity of the S-DEL strain might have been modified. Pigs infected with this novel variant experienced moderate-to-severe clinical presentation associated with PED in infected piglets; however, neonatal morbidity and mortality rates vary among litters and are lower than those reported in severe G2b outbreaks. The immune status acquired from previous natural exposures and vaccination programs may have at least contributed to the mild-to-moderate disease outcome presently observed in the field. However, despite the prior infection and vaccinations in farm A, sow herds showed relatively low neutralizing antibody titers in their sera and colostrum ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Moreover, anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies were detectable in growing-finishing pigs, indicating the presence of circulating virus infection in this herd ( Supplementary Fig.  S3 ). This circumstance may generate immune environments that are advantageous for the survival and spread of PEDV (KNU-1815) within a farm and between farms. The virus continuously evolves under lower immune pressure to generate a new variant (KNU-1829) that may escape immune system surveillance, which in turn causes recurrences on the same farm and also new occurrences of PEDV (KNU-1830) in adjacent herds by farm-to-farm transmission via contaminated sources, including stray cats. Given its critical dual functions during cell entry, the PEDV S protein is the major target of host anti-virus antibodies, like other coronavirus S proteins [4] . A recent study revealed that the conserved S2 subunit, including its C-terminal portion, contains major antigenic determinants that strongly elicit neutralizing antibodies [15] . More importantly, the novel S-DEL recurrent variants described here have characteristic mutations within the neutralizing epitope of S compared to the primary strain, probably producing antigenic variation in the 1371-1377 epitope region. Considering these data, we hypothesize that the genetic deletions and variations in S that have arisen under field conditions facilitate antigenic drift, which allows the virus to evade host immune defenses, such as neutralizing antibodies, developed as a result of natural infection and vaccination. This phenomenon could weaken viral pathogenicity, resulting in less-lethal infections and leading to the establishment of an endemic state. Research involving reverse genetics is likely to provide fundamental insights into the specific roles of deletions and other mutations in PEDV pathogenesis, particularly in the putative antigenic determinants within the S protein. This study underscores the need to perform periodic monitoring and surveillance investigations to identify novel antigenic variants that may emerge via persistent genetic drift in enzootic situations and increase the likelihood of new PEDV outbreaks.",18.781957136103287,11.330776507932018

Antigenic drift occurs because the virus' RNA polymerase has no proofreading function; therefore substitutions are introduced resulting in a somewhat predictable error rate between 1 3 10 23 and 8 3 10 23 substitutions per site per year. 8 Antigenic drift may contribute to the agent's ability to elude the host immune response, but generally it does not result in significant virulence changes in the virus. By contrast, antigenic shift can radically change the virus' pathogenic potential. Antigenic shift generally occurs by reassortment of heterologous influenza virus gene segments when the host is co-infected with two different influenza subtypes. The influenza genome is segmented and the gene segments of different influenza viruses can reassort to create unique viruses. 8 For example, if a host is co-infected with H5N1 and H3N2, then new reassortant viruses such as H5N2 and H3N1 can result. Antigenic shift can greatly increase virulence or host adaptation in a single viral generation.

This is particularly important in wake of continuously emerging newer and more virulent strains of virus. Rapid evolution of virus has outpaced the conventional surveillance protocols like antigenic, serological and agglutination assays, which lack robustness, reproducibility, simplicity and shelf-life. Current need is for a protocol that is rapid, portable and costeffective, with high sensitivity and specificity. In this regard, optical biosensors that feature portability, sensor miniaturization, and the ability to screen many samples at a time are finding more use in biomedical diagnostics as compared to other comparable techniques that lack miniaturization and high throughput. Surface Plasmon resonance is particularly important as it offers highly sensitive and specific kinetic analysis of biomolecular interaction in label-free manner. However, optical biosensors require highly trained manpower, advance laboratory infrastructure, which might be a limiting factor for resource-constrained setups in developing or under developed countries or in far-flung remote areas. Therefore, there is a need to rationalize and improvise the optical biosensing platforms in terms of portability, cost involved, affordability, user-friendliness and ready-touse mode.

The rate at which mutations fix in a population is termed the substitution rate, or evolutionary rate, which is measured by comparing the genomes of different isolates of a virus collected at several different time points (Duffy et al., 2008) . Once again, RNA viruses possess much higher substitution rates than DNA viruses, ranging from 0.01 substitutions per site per year (sub/site/yr) in the RNA poliovirus type 1 to 7 × 10 −7 in the DNA virus monkeypox. As suggested by theory, in most viruses substitution rates correlate well with mutation rates (Table 1 ). This suggests that the short-term mutation rate is an important determinant of the rate of long-term molecular evolution. However, for the fastest mutators (mostly RNA viruses), there appears to be an upper limit to the rate of evolution. This is due to the exceptionally high load of deleterious variant viruses in these small RNA viruses, which slows down their rate of molecular evolution. This high load dictates a threshold beyond which populations may go extinct. Indeed, it has been shown that by artificially increasing the mutation rate of different RNA viruses, the population will collapse through a process termed lethal mutagenesis. This finding has led to the development of therapeutic drugs that induce lethal mutagenesis, which are used to treat a variety of viral infections such as Hepatitis C and West Nile virus (Beaucourt and Vignuzzi, 2014 ).",18.365408906120688,9.59344511337332

This was observed as the loss of ability to bind 2 monoclonal antibodies, and evidence for an alteration in virus expression has been gathered. It seems clear that a rapid mutational drift may occur during virus-persistence in vitro. Holland et al. (1 979) reported that a continual evolution in virus-specific RNA was demonstrable during vesicular stomatitis virus persistence. Most of these changes were manifested in the production of small plaque, temperature-sensitive mutants. This is to be expected since it may be supposed that the effect of most amino acid substitutions would be to destabilize a particular protein, and relatively few would lead to complete loss of function. A similar situation presumably exists during morbillivirus persistence. We have demonstrated changes in H-protein antigenicity during SSPE virus persistence in the absence of antibody selection. Furthermore, the production of small plaque, or ts mutants during measles virus persistence is already well documented (ter Meulen et al., 1973 ; Haspel et al., 1973 ; Gould and Linton, 1975 ; Ju et al., 1978) . Moreover, the ts mutants fail to complement each other, and ts (+) revertants retain their small plaque phenotype (Haspel et al., 1973) .

Using the ferret model, we trace the evolutionary pathway by which an avian-like virus evolves the capacity for mammalian replication and airborne transmission. During initial infection, within-host HA diversity increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions, selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a ''loose'' bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic constraints.

Unlike some other data types, however, putative homologies in molecular data are not directly observable. Sequences from various organisms are often unequal in length. Hence, the correspondences among sequence positions are not evident and some sort of procedure is required to determine which regions are homologous. This procedure is typically multiple sequence alignment. Alignment inserts gaps to make the putatively corresponding residue line up into columns. These columns (characters) comprise the matrix used to reconstruct cladograms. The matrix is then submitted to phylogenetic analysis in the same manner as other forms of data such as morphological characters scored by an investigator. Thus the primary reason in phylogenetics to create an alignment has a strongly operational basis -to make it possible to submit these data to standard phylogeny programs that were designed to handle column vectors of morphological characters.

Data corresponding to constant selection coefficients (Figure 3 , black line) do indeed collapse on a single master curve, even though we varied m, s 0 , and the type of adaptation wave (weak/strong genetic drift). Note also the transition from a linear regime to the sublinear regimes with power law exponents 1 2 and 1 3 in one and two dimensions, respectively. These exponents are consistent with our prediction in Equation 3. Moreover, Figure 3 displays results for simulations in which the fitness effects of new mutations were drawn from an exponential and a gamma distribution (with shape parameter k = 2), respectively. Note that although data for the different distributions follow our scaling predictions individually, they are slightly shifted with respect to each other. This indicates that the prefactors of the adaptation speed depend on the tails of the distribution. Broader distributions tend to yield larger adaptation speeds, apparently because they will more frequently give rise to the sampling of unusually large-s clones that outcompete average-s clones. As a consequence, fixations are more frequent and the adaptation speed is higher (see also Appendix F). The effect is stronger in the clonal interference than in the periodic selection regime.",17.400356440270812,10.509908382081694

Under this scenario, positive-strand RNA viruses are indeed direct descendants of the primordial RNA-protein world whereas the reverse-transcribing elements provide the means for the transition to the DNA world. The pre-cellular stage of evolution can be envisaged as a pool of small, virus-like genetic elements in which all the genomic strategies evolved and the separation between viruses and cellular life forms was precipitated by the gradual accretion of small dsDNA elements into large molecules ( Figure 4 ) (the nature of the primordial compartmentalization is beyond the scope of this article; several models have been developed). The capsids might have evolved at this stage of evolution and would protect genomes of the primordial genetic elements and facilitate their dissemination [12] . This model goes beyond the notion that viruses coexisted with cells at all stages of evolution by suggesting that evolution of life actually started with a virus-like stage, with the advent of modern-type cells being a comparatively late event [30].",16.642761365371946,8.41793260527581

Its occurrence has been shown to contribute to the natural evolution of IBV. This highly contagious virus comprises many different serotypes, and new ones emerge regularly, with the result that these viruses escape from host immunity and cause new outbreaks. Although many of the new variants arise by genetic drift as a result of subtle mutations in the spike protein (S) gene, similar to the changes that lead to antigenic drift in influenza viruses, new serotypes apparently also originate from genetic exchange of S gene sequences between different viruses through homologous RNA recombination (Kusters et al. 1990; Cavanagh et al. 1990; Wang et al. 1993; Jia et al. 1995) . Of considerable impact on these evolutionary processes is the veterinary practice of vaccination. Large-scale application of (combinations of) live attenuated vaccine viruses drastically enhances the opportunities for recombination. The identification of vaccine-derived sequences in field isolates is therefore not surprising (Kusters et al. 1990; Wang et al. 1993; Lee and Jackwood 2001) . Rather, these events actually seem to occur at high frequency and are not restricted to the S gene region, as attested by the complex genetic makeup of IBV strains that carry the footprints of multiple independent recombinations (Jia et al. 1995; Lee and Jackwood 2000) .",24.960922781163458,12.443682144320906

The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which resulted in many millions of deaths worldwide, highlights the potential of the virus to be highly pathogenic and cause severe disease [ 1 ] . There are three primary serotypes based on genetic variations in the surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA): influenza A (IAV), influenza B (IBV), and influenza C (ICV). Current influenza vaccine preparations consist of either inactivated or live-attenuated trivalent or quadrivalent preparations of antigens from two IAV and either one or two IBV strains. ICV is far less common than IAV or IBV and is associated with more mild disease. However, seasonal variations due to a variety of factors including genetic drift and incongruities between the antigens of the vaccine and the dominant strains within a flu season have resulted in marginal efficacy of the influenza vaccine at best and the need for annual vaccinations. The availability of more immunogenic live-attenuated influenza vaccine options opens the door to the potential for genetic modifications, which may improve duration and efficacy of protective immunity.

In addition, for massive vaccinations in veterinary medicine, damage to the vaccine and improper administration are additional problems.

Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages of the CNS, may be a major target of IL-6 and effector cells in IL-6-mediated neuroinflammation. Therefore the objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the nature of the microglial response to IL-6 in the CNS.",20.330787353354257,11.634836173477915

These viruses are enveloped viruses with a genome of single-stranded RNA. The majority of influenza viruses are classified antigenically as type A (based on internal viral proteins). Subtypes of the virus are based on antigenicity of the two viral glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope, the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins, and are designated by numbers (H1-16; N1-9). In addition to antigenicity, the hemagglutinin also affects virulence of the virus, and certain subtypes are associated with more pathogenic strains, notably H5 and H7. Another important characteristic of this family is the segmentation of the genome, with each virus containing seven to eight separate genetic segments encoding individual viral proteins. This allows for a unique form of viral mutation called reassortment. As with all RNA viruses, the mutation rate of the genome is quite high, and generally manifests as small point mutations, which lead to relatively minor amino acid changes in the viral proteins. Reassortment involves the exchange of entire gene segments when one or more distinct influenza viruses infect the same cell. This is often the mechanism of significant changes in antigenicity, virulence, or host/tissue tropism of influenza viruses. For example, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza is a quadruple reassortant, having gene segments from four distinct influenza viruses, two mammalian and two avian in origin. 24 Reassortment is often referred to as ""antigenic shift,"" reflecting the relatively large change in the viral genome, while ""antigenic drift"" refers to the smaller point mutations observed from season to season within a single strain.",17.892368604442805,11.400929074878956

However, certain features of genetic evolution of organisms present problems when using this method of tree construction. First, inaccuracies can occur as a result of the existence of homoplasy. Homoplasy describes processes, such as convergent evolution, by which a single mutation can occur twice on independent branches of a tree. Hence, it implies that two sequences sharing a mutation were not necessarily derived from a common ancestor that also contained this mutation. Another hurdle to overcome is back-mutation, by which a mutation reverts to its original genotype. This can cause the specific sequence to appear more ancestral than is necessarily the case. A further drawback to the method of maximum parsimony is that it takes no account of the rate at which mutations arise and the varying probabilities of different mutations occurring (i.e., transversions vs. transitions).",18.625144355216257,9.643670645804724

In some viruses, mutation rates may be as high as 10 23 to 10 24 per incorporated nucleotide (e.g., in retroviruses such as HIV), whereas in others they may be as low as 10 28 to 10 211 (e.g., in herpesviruses), which is similar to the mutation rates seen in cellular DNA. These differences are due to the mechanism of genome replication, with error rates in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases generally being higher than DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Some RNA virus polymerases do have proofreading functions, but in general mutation rates are higher in most RNA viruses than in DNA viruses. For a virus, mutations are a mixed blessing. The ability to generate antigenic variants that can escape the immune response is a clear advantage, but mutation also results in many defective particles, as most mutations are deleterious. In the most extreme cases (e.g., HIV), the error rate is 10 23 to 10 24 per nucleotide incorporated. The HIV genome is approximately 9.7 kb long; therefore, there will be 0.9À9.7 mutations in every genome copied. Hence, in this case, the wild-type virus actually consists of a fleeting majority type that dominates the dynamic equilibrium (i.e., the population of genomes) present in all cultures of the virus. These mixtures of molecular variants are known as quasispecies and also occur in other RNA viruses (e.g., picornaviruses). However, the majority of these variants will be noninfectious or seriously disadvantaged and are therefore rapidly weeded out of a replicating population. This mechanism is an important force in virus evolution (see ""The Virome-Evolution and Epidemiology""). Historically, most genetic analysis of viruses has been performed on virus mutants isolated from mutagen-treated populations. Currently, defined and highly specific mutations in particular genes or control sequences (e.g., single nucleotide changes) are usually introduced using molecular methods such as PCR. This is known as sitedirected or site-specific mutagenesis.",17.099636337761453,7.759288658262818

In general, virus escape occurs through negative selection by circulating antibodies in the organism; it may occur also by genetic drift. RNA virus populations are quasispecies, a term that refers to their extreme genetic heterogeneity, being formed by multiple genetic variants in different and sometimes rapidly varying proportions [18] . This generally leads to the frequent emergence of virus variants differing in some phenotypic trait, usually but not necessarily when subjected to the appropriate selection pressure [18] . As a consequence, drug-resistant variants (see Chap. 20) or antibody-resistant variants, especially in the case of RNA viruses (such as FMDV or HIV-1, among many others) will appear most readily; this phenomenon severely hampers viral disease control.",26.306506403401674,11.727043083151493

A special case is that of quasispecies which are clouds of very similar genotypes that appear in a population at mutation-selection balance [2] . Since the number of targets (the substrate) is limited, fitter clones tend to eliminate less fit mutants, which are subsequently regenerated by the mutation mechanism [3] . They are the combined result of mutations and recombination. Other sources of variability result from co-infection (simultaneous viral infection), superinfection (delayed secondary infection). On the contrary, selection and random drift decrease variability. The fact that deleterious or less fitted variants are not instantaneously counter selected allows for the coexistence and co-evolution of different strains of a virus within the same host. Although the conditions for the formation and survival of new strains have not always been understood, small scale evolution such as variability at population level may experience different mutation/selection balance than the genetic variability estimated from sequence analysis which represent fixed genotypes. Indeed, recent studies show that the rate of molecular evolution appears to accelerate when measured over evolutionary short timescales [4] , which strongly contrast with substitution rates inferred in phylogenetic studies. Molecular virology studies appear the natural benchmark, given that viruses have usually very high mutation rates and large populations. We aim at modelling viral multi strain short and long term evolutionary dynamics during the immune response. The multi strains can be thought as viral populations. Since there is a tremendous lack of studies attempting at integrating population and phylogenetic studies, our work represents the efforts to link speciation at small and large evolutionary scale.

Therefore, analyses of the extent and causes of these unique codon choices and nucleotide composition are essential to understand viral evolution and virus-host interactions [52] .

The study of codon-usage patterns in viruses can be rewarding with respect to understanding not only viral gene expression and vaccine development but also virus adaptation, evolution and host-virus interactions [9, 17] .

The most important task of innate immunity is identification of the pathogenic invasion by PRRs. Although PRRs are thought to be highly conserved in general, recent identification of PRR polymorphisms suggests that the genes encoding PRRs in current generation may have resulted from positive selection through survival from infectious diseases. Furthermore, recent genetic studies have outlined that the intracellular toll-like receptors (TLR)s, especially nucleotide sensing TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9), have been under stronger selection than have membrane bound TLRs [9] . This biased selection may result from the availability of the PAMPs per pathogen and the location of TLRs. Nucleotide sensing TLRs are mainly responsible for the detection of viral pathogens which carry fewer PAMPs than other types of pathogens, and allowing insertion of foreign nucleotides within the cell is more dangerous than handling pathogens outside of the plasma membrane. Therefore, adaptive evolution by historical constrains including infections and non-adaptive genetic drift shape our innate immune responses in order to survive the evolutionary arms race of humans and microbes.

However, the resulting viruses appear to need a balance between the HA Sia binding and NA Sia cleaving activities, which may be accomplished by co-evolution of either or both genes [54] . It has been shown that sialidases from many pathogens (bacterial and influenza) have optimal enzymatic activities for α2,3-linked Neu5Ac Sia, and the shift to the α2,6 linkage, hydroxylation of Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc, or addition of O-acetyl groups to C4, 7, or 9 reduce the capacity of sialidases to cleave in vitro [44, 55, 56] . The natural in vivo activity of human or avian influenza NA towards modified Sia appears to be consistently reduced, while 'drift' in linkage specificity has been observed over large influenza evolutionary timescales [57] . It appears that for influenza viruses, HA compensatory mutations are commonly used to avoid inhibitory or 'decoy' Sias, rather than changes in the sialidase specificity of NA, and also that sialidases cannot readily gain the ability to avoid inhibition by at least the 4-O-Ac Sia [58] . Similarly, NA resistance alleles to sialidase inhibitors (e.g. Oseltamivir resistant influenza) can arise, but may require favorable compensatory epistatic alleles in HA to allow fixation [59, 60] . For example, mutations that allow human influenza viruses to replicate in the presence of high levels of 4-O-Ac Sia occurred in the Sia binding site of the HA and prevented HA binding to the 4-O-Ac Sia. Those mutations were seen in the H3N8 and H7N7 equine influenza viruses, as well as in human influenza viruses experimentally adapted to grow in the presence of horse serum proteins [58] . It is not known whether selection of mutations in HA to avoid these inhibitory modified Sia also alters HA receptor binding specificities for other Sia, or alters antigenic epitopes, and thereby shapes the adaptive potential of the viruses in different hosts. However, it is likely that the relative abundance of modified Sia forms in different hosts contributes to host-specific HA and NA selection, and may also constrain the relative transmission potential in novel emergent viruses.",19.787117618864674,10.033716512214209

Influenza A contains two surface proteins (glycoproteins), called hemaglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA): HA proteins are associated with viral attachment and cell entry using a fusion pathway, while NA proteins regulate the release of progeny virus from an infected cell. Antigenic drift and shift are two mechanisms that create variations in the antigenic properties of these two proteins that allow influenza A to bypass the acquired immunity of a population, Figure 4 . Antigenic drift occurs when small point mutations accumulate gradually, altering the antigenic properties of the two surface proteins. This can cause population immunity to partially decrease, resulting in seasonal epidemics. Antigenic shift involves major changes in proteins, sometimes through the swapping of entire gene segments. The genetic reassortment occurs when two or more unique viruses infect the same cell and generate mixed progeny viruses (Chen and Deng, 2009; Kaye and Pringle, 2005) . In particular, genetic reassortments of the HA antigens may result in large worldwide epidemics or pandemics. Waterfowl are thought to be the largest source of diverse viruses from which gene reassortment may occur, as they are known to carry viruses with 16 different HA proteins. When a population has no or little immunity to a new subtype and the new subtype is highly transmissible, pandemics may result.",16.923515284508003,9.92159964994325

Surveillance and characterization of the circulating strains are important in determining whether an available influenza vaccine will give protection or not. Influenza viruses are classified into types A, B, and C, of which types B and C are specific to humans, whereas type A viruses can have different hosts, both birds and different mammals including humans. There are only three A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) known to be currently circulating among humans as seasonal influenza. The seasonal influenza epidemics occur as a result of genetic drift, the accumulation of point mutations that occur due to lack of proofreading (Webster et al., 1992) . Antigenic shift, an abrupt change in the hemagglutinin and/or the neuraminidase proteins of the virus, causes the sudden emergence of a new subtype of a type A virus that is antigenically distinct from former circulating influenza A viruses. The new virus is potentially capable of causing an epidemic in an immunologically naı¨ve human population (Webster et al., 1992) . Worldwide epidemics, called pandemics, occur only occasionally.

They have started every second year with a minor spring outbreak followed by a major one the next winter. During each season, RSV has been circulating for more than 12 months. Monoclonal antibodies differentiating between A and B strain groups have been used to type clinical specimens and isolates. Group A or B strains predominated ( \ 70%) in alternating cycles, except for 1991-92, when prevalence of group B strains was lower than expected and neither strain group predominated. Results of genotyping and limited nucleotide sequencing of G protein genes for group A strains from 1991-92 implicated emergence of a group A genotype that had been rare in previous years. In a clinical study performed in Turku University Hospital, RSV infections with group A strains were found to be more severe than those with group B strains, whereas the latter were more often associated with acute otitis media.

The consequences, for humans, of antigenic drift in animal species are not well understood. Veterinary vaccination is a powerful tool that has been used to control AIV outbreaks in poultry [14] . However, large-scale vaccination of livestock is not affordable in some parts of the world. Furthermore, vaccination may confound serological surveillance efforts for early detection of AIV in domestic poultry unless the vaccine design and serologic detection assay are directed against different viral proteins. This strategy is referred to as a Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA) approach [35] . However, the growing availability of AIV sequence data and increasingly widespread laboratory capacity for molecular surveillance has the potential to abrogate this problem. Finally, suboptimal vaccination via poor vaccination coverage or use of mismatched vaccines may result in nonsterilizing immunity, where morbidity and mortality in poultry are reduced but viral replication still occurs. This may drive viral escape and promote endemicity of escape variants. In this manner, suboptimal vaccination may drive antigenic drift and provide more opportunities for reassortment with human viruses, thereby potentially increasing the chances of zoonotic transmission [14, [36] [37] [38] .",19.588677859482313,11.50234387284716

Although cell entry is the first step to virus infection and a predominant factor governing virus tropism, intracellular factors also play a role, and over time a virus will naturally become adapted to these components of the host immune system. If a virus has moved to a different host, it is possible it may retain some of the features for optimization with the prior host. Thus, although ISG15 may not be a primary determining factor for all viruses, it could serve as a tracer for the natural history of the virus. Adding to the value of ISG15 in such a probe is the fact that viruses in the same family possess the same repertoire of potential ISG15-interacting proteins, likely creating a common interface for comparison. While viruses in the same family sometimes utilize different cell-surface receptors, ISG15 may present a consistent point of interaction that makes it ideal for tracing a virus's evolutionary past. Alternatively, interspecies ISG15 diversity may have predictive value regarding the potential hosts to which the virus could most easily adapt. For example, MERS-CoV is unable to infect mouse cells due to an inability to interact with the mouse DPP4 receptor. Exogenous or transgenic expression of the human DPP4 receptor results in successful infection that after serially passaging can produce mouse-adapted pathogenic strains [84e86]. Interestingly, nonadapted MERS-CoV PLP is already able to interact with mouse ISG15, and while some of the mutations generated in the mouse-adapted strains are present in the nsp3 protein, none of them map to the PLP domain [64,85e87] . Looking at the residues of ISG15 that PLPs are known to engage reveals that there is a mix of conserved and variable features with which the PLP interacts (Fig. 3b) . This includes, for example, Trp123 that is highly conserved among mammals, and the almost perfectly conserved Cterminal tail. However, there are also notable areas of variation, particularly at positions 89 and 149, that the PLP must be able to accommodate. While the conserved regions may provide a platform for interaction with mammalian ISG15s in general, these other less conserved regions can markedly influence how well the PLP engages specific species' ISG15 [64] . This is reflected in the relatively broad, but not universal activity of the PLP for different ISG15 species. For example, although bat, camel, and human ISG15 only share 62%e66% sequence identity to each other, they all show susceptibility to the MERS-CoV PLP as would be consistent with the virus's known and predicted host range. For other species, including sheep, shrews, and fish that are not predicted to be hosts for the virus, the activity is noticeably lower suggesting the need to accommodate specific sequence variations. Considering this, the combination of the PLP's ability to interact with mouse ISG15 and the lack of mutations in the PLP of mouse-adapted strains suggests that the MERS-CoV, in a sense, may have been partially ""pre-adapted"" to mice as potential hosts, and that overcoming the threshold of cell entry was all that was required to replicate and eventually fully adapt. It would be interesting to apply this reasoning to other systems to ascertain its predictive value. Such knowledge could aid in understanding the risk posed by a particular virus during the course of genetic drift, as well as inform the design of appropriate model systems of disease.",18.789948838304838,10.343182396961227

In parallel, cuttingedge developments in materials science and in nanotechnology have also been registered. Veterinary science and practice ""took the train"" and, as such, have been greatly favored from such advances. Microfl uidic technologies and nanoengineered structures, especially when coupled together, have led to an unprecedented degree of high-throughput, large-scale genetic analysis, even at wholegenome levels. Ultimately, the high-throughput and multiplexing abilities of in vivo (implanted or swallowed) nanosensor arrays should be able to monitor animals' physiology and health status during their entire lifetime, and even beyond, intended to track and assess the quality of animal products for human feeding. In this way, the current shortcomings related with the limited number of sanitary surveillance resources that can be allocated to guarantee proper product origin, stocking, and shipping could be circumvented. So far, only few POC schemes and devices have reached the exquisite sensitivity thresholds required for detection of nucleicacid traces in unamplifi ed biological samples, which is the ultimate goal of nucleic-acid testing. As for human diagnostics, the veterinary medicine and practice still lack the commercial availability of more POC devices, more probably as a result of manufacturing and commercial cost-effectiveness constraints than to a shortage of fundamental knowledge. While remaining too expensive for single testing, many tests targeted for POC diagnosis will ultimately prove to be cost-effective when savings with unnecessary laboratory manpower are taken into account. Other major challenges are the need for initial investments that are often prohibitive for small companies and the usual diffi culties for obtaining regulatory approvals for testing and commercialization. For effective improvement of human health, more adequate and coordinated actions to face animal diseases are needed, especially concerning livestock. This includes a more effective technology transfer from developed countries to those where diseases are prevalent and where disease preventive measures may be crucial to avoid or contain epidemics.

Novel and improved electronic devices and biosensor platforms have emerged as a consequence of the inherent small size, enlarged surface area, and unusual optical, magnetic, catalytic, and mechanical properties of nanomaterials, unlike those of bulk materials [ 24 ] . Depending on their specifi c nature, for biosensing, nanomaterials may act as labels (including signal amplifi cation), as biomolecule immobilization supports, or even as probes for specifi c biotarget anchoring. Certain nanomaterials can also be used for pre-concentration of biological targets. Among these applications, labeling has been the most commonly employed. Label-based detection methods are usually more time-consuming and labor intensive than label-free methods due to the labeling steps. Labels have also limited shelf lives and are subjected to leakage from sensing surfaces. However, label-based methods usually provide superior performance, especially in terms of sensitivity, than label-free ones. Moreover, standardized protocols with labeling procedures are already available. Fluorescence labeling has been, by far, the most common approach in this regard, although suffering from pH sensitivity and photobleaching over time [ 53 ] . Such handicaps and the advent of nanoengineering have propelled the search and development of new and improved labels. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been the most widely employed type of nanomaterials for biosensing, especially metallic NPs. Metallic NPs are inorganic NPs that exhibit improved physicochemical characteristics compared to fl uorescent labels, including higher sensitivity. In general, they are suitable for construction of highdensity bioanalytical devices, taking advantage of their high signalto-noise ratio (S/N). They are easily synthesizable and functionalized (by simple mixing at room temperature) and have a controlled, self-assembled surface structure [ 24 ] . Gold nanoparticles (GNPs), in particular, are already used frequently in molecular diagnosis; some of their advantages include low toxicity and versatility for many specifi c biorecognition applications and schemes. One common way to enhance the GNP signal even further, and thus the sensitivity of detection, is the inclusion of a fi nal step of silver staining (""silver enhancement""), yielding detection schemes able to preclude the use of a prior PCR amplifi cation step. The high sensitivity exhibited by many NP-based detection layouts, especially in the form of microarrays, has enabled to avoid a prior step of nucleic-acid amplifi cation [ 69 ] .",16.541811624972826,8.051219375861766

The purpose of these factors is to improve a virus's ability to complete its replication cycle in the target cell, thus spreading and propagating the virus to naïve animals. Virulence factors control the processes involved in (1) replication, including attachment to, entering, replication in, and release of virus from target cells, and (2) evading, modulating, or suppressing the host's innate and adaptive immune responses. For example, feline immunodeficiency virus hides within the immune system and replicates and spreads within macrophages and T lymphocytes. Other viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade cytotoxic T lymphocyte and NK cell lysis of virus-infected target cells, disrupt complement activation, synthesize cytokine homologues that interfere with normal immunologic functions, and synthesize molecules that inhibit interferon responses or block the induction of apoptosis in virus-infected cells. Other viral virulence factors include viral proteins, as well as by-products of virus replication, such as caspases and caspase-like molecules, that accumulate in the cell and have toxin-like activities on target cells (Fig. 4-34 ; Box 4-4). As an example of a viral toxin, attachment or replication cycle. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses; however, fortunately, viral infections (viral antigens) usually activate host innate and adaptive defense mechanisms and cause an immune response (cell-mediated), which can completely eliminate a virus or prevent an infection by a virus (vaccination). However, these defensive responses can also injure and lyse target cells, leading to disease. The list of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on target cells is extensive. These effects are often called cytopathic effects, and as a general rule, many viral infections result in lysis of target cells. Depending on the virus and its replication cycle, injury to and lysis of target cells can occur at any point during counterbalanced by their slower replication speed, allowing host defense mechanisms to intervene in the replication process and kill the virus and/or virus-infected cell. Genomic variation is a broad term used to categorize a group of biologic processes that allow viruses to acquire new virulence factors (genetic diversity) that favor their survival through infective and replicative mechanisms in target cells. The most common form of genomic variation is called antigenic drift (genetic drift), a natural mutation in a viral genome over time. It is caused by a spontaneous point mutation of individual nucleic acid bases in viral DNA or RNA. These point mutations are usually silent and do not change the protein encoded by the affected gene; however, some mutations can result in a new protein (e.g., capsid or envelope proteins as examples), thus providing an opportunity for the virus to improve its chances of infectivity, replication, and spread during its replication cycle. As an example, a ""new strain"" of virus arising from antigenic drift may have a ""new"" attachment protein in its capsid or envelope. Because of the length of time it takes to develop an effective immune response to the new protein, the immune system is ineffective in defending the animal against viral attachment and entry into target cells. Similarly, mutations could occur in viral genes linked to biologic processes involved in spread, replication, or shedding, which could also make the virus more pathogenic.",17.800804976492273,11.162941272411944

There is greater control over the risks of virulence reversion when using DNA vaccines; therefore, DNA vaccines are considered in some aspects to be safer. Because of this, DNA vaccines can have potentially greater utility for immunocompromised patients. However, there are remaining issues that must be resolved for enabling DNA vaccines to be clinically translated for human use.

laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection is crucial in the influenza surveillance and is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines and antiviral drugs,0.24294026469753519,3.1166138648986816,4.39207649230957,ad5f23e2-1283-4824-bb42-c059e6b2b670,custom_license/Incidence of Circulating Antibodies Against Hemagglutinin of Influenza Viruses in the in Poland,"Influenza is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses from the Orthomyxoviridae family. The continuing evolution of the virus is the cause of seasonal epidemics and, from time to time, of pandemics in the human population. Furthermore, due to appearance of influenza-like illnesses, diagnosis of this disease on the basis of clinical symptoms is possible only during the outbreak. It should be noted that in case of respiratory infections various clinical symptoms can be caused by the same virus and, on the other hand, the same set of symptoms can be caused by more than 200 different viruses (e.g. parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus). For this reason, the laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection is crucial in the influenza surveillance and is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Laboratory diagnosis of influenza includes confirmation of the presence of influenza virus antigen in the material collected from the patient and serological evidence of infection with influenza virus by detecting the increase of specific antibodies in patient's serum (Brydak 2008) . The major line of defense from influenza infection are antibodies directed against two glycoproteins exposed on the surface of the virion -hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (Johansson et al. 1989) . Furthermore, evolution of influenza virus is most evident in the case of these surface proteins. HA and NA antigens are constantly changing due to antigenic pressure. They both are highly immunogenic, and antibodies produced in response to viral infection are specific for a particular subtype of hemagglutinin (H1-H18) and neuraminidase (N1-N11) and do not give complete protection against all influenza virus strains (Nicholson et al. 1998) . The presence of hemagglutinin antibodies (anti-HA) provides not only protection against infection with specific strains of influenza virus, but also might alleviate symptoms of the disease in case of infection with another variant of the virus. This is caused by the occurrence of so-called cross-reactive antibodies. It has been shown that subtypespecific anti-HA antibodies can decrease the infectivity of the virus of other subtype by disruption of proliferation and release of viral particles during infection (Ekiert et al. 2011; Epstein and Price 2010; Thorsby et al. 2008) . For this reason, regular vaccinations are essential for reducing the impact of seasonal influenza and influenza prevention. Seasonal vaccinations protect from infection with currently circulating viruses and give cross-protection, which can reduce viral replication, accelerate viral clearance, and thus reduce the severity of disease. The World Health Organization leads the global influenza surveillance and gives seasonal recommendations for influenza virus strains included in the vaccine for the upcoming epidemic season.",15.606876391999354,10.343055469385138

Previous studies aimed at peculiarities of nucleotide composition and codon usage that are either general for large groups of viruses, like all (human) RNA viruses (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003) , all plant viruses (Dreher and Miller, 2006) , segmented versus nonsegmented viruses (Haseloff et al., 1984) or specific for individual virus species, like SARS coronavirus (Gu et al., 2004) and H5N1 influenza A virus (Zhou et al., 2005) . These studies did not address the role of codon and nucleotide preferences as driving forces in the evolution of particular virus families, primarily due to the lack of data on their evolutionary history. For instance, the differences in codon and nucleotide preferences among the Retroviridae were described (van Hemert and Berkhout, 1995; Berkhout et al., 2002) .

Again, this increase has occurred despite the fact that the detection and identification of previously unknown pathogens currently depends on heterogeneous surveillance systems of variable sensitivity and precision. Regardless, heightened surveillance, detection, and identification of emerging pathogens are currently active and prolific fields of research.

The scientific community and public health systems may have reached a point where they are now identifying and characterizing previously unknown pathogens from fewer cases, owing to enhanced detection methods. Better surveillance and detection systems are widely recognized as a critical aspect of better preparedness and response to public health events involving the spread of infectious agents. Very few countries have active surveillance systems, which can detect unknown pathogens via algorithms. The detection of new viruses following systematic processes is a rapidly growing yet young scientific field.

The great obsession of evolutionary genetics has been to reveal the respective roles of random fluctuations in allele frequencies-genetic drift-and the natural selection of advantageous mutations in shaping genetic diversity (Gillespie 1998) . Although, at face value, evolutionary genetics may seem of little relevance to the problem of viral emergence, we suggest that it in fact provides an essential theoretical framework. For example, it might be that emergence simply requires the chance exposure of a virus to a new susceptible population, with little involvement of natural selection. Alternatively, it may be that viruses have to adapt to successfully spread in a new species. In this scenario, different species might represent different fitness peaks on an ""adaptive landscape"" and that traversing between these peaks is difficult because they are connected by valleys of low fitness. Moreover, because an emergent virus will only infect a small number of individuals when it first enters a new population, genetic drift is expected to play a major role in determining what viral mutations get fixed, because drift is more potent in small populations. Finally, the respective influences of drift and selection will also vary according to the size of the population bottleneck that accompanies viral transmission among hosts, which will itself be a function of the mode of transmission.",35.953298466045375,15.821054148498725

At the research level, proteomic profiling has been utilized. With the maturation of immunoassays, immunodiffusion tests, ELISA, and immunoturbidimetric assays have been employed. Where possible, colorimetric assays have also been implemented. Lastly, the APR has been broadly judged by the use of serum protein electrophoresis. This method provides quantitation of albumin and then fractions of APP which are grouped as alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma globulins based on their migration characteristics. 33 Major benefits of this method are not having the need for species-specific reagents and the assessment of the complete APR-albumin and the groups of APP. Protein electrophoresis has been commonly implemented in avian species as an adjunct test to infectious disease assessments. 69, 70 A negative to this assay is the limits of detection as fraction sensitivity is at the g/dL level rather than the mg/L level obtained by specific APP assays. 71 APP assays have become more available to researchers and veterinarians in recent years. In many cases, labor intensive and costly ELISA-based assays have been replaced by automated assays that have heterologous cross-reactivity with many species. Examples of this type of assay include the Eiken SAA immunoturbidimetric assay (a human assay which reactive with horse and cat but not dog SAA) and the Randox reagents for CRP (a human assay which is reactive with dog CRP). 45, 72 These assays afford a commercial source of reagents negating lengthy developmental time. In other cases, species-specific reagents are preferred. These include an immunoturbidimetric assay for feline AGP and a pig-MAP-specific ELISA. 61, 66 These needs are based more on the unique APP in particular species which defies the routine use of human or other reagents.",19.735370452343613,10.14383959303172
Much of this chapter has explored the issue of the role played by viral evolution in the process of emergence,0.15934298575658293,1.4790563583374023,1.8610789775848389,8fc01ef3-2571-4782-b5de-30db10e509b0,custom_license/The Evolutionary Genetics of Viral Emergence,"Much of this chapter has explored the issue of the role played by viral evolution in the process of emergence. The result, contrary to many perceptions of the inherent adaptability of RNA viruses, is that successful emergence, characterized by sustained human-to-human transmission may be a far more difficult process than might be expected given the remarkable rates at which RNA viruses mutate. Why might this be so? One probable answer lies in the theory that the genomes of RNA viruses are so small (usually less than 15 kb in length), and so multifunctional, that most mutations are likely to affect some critical aspect of virus biology (Holmes 2003a) . As such, although mutations are abundant in RNA viruses, the vast majority are deleterious, or slightly deleterious, and will reduce viral fitness in the long term. Much of the genetic variation sampled within RNA virus populations, including those of emerging viruses in new host species, will therefore consist of short-lived deleterious mutations, which can be thought of as a form of mutational straightjacket. Unlike many other evolutionary systems that are dominated by a drift-selection balance, viral evolutionary genetics may be dominated by a mutation-selection balance (Domingo and Holland 1997) . The requirements of a compact and highly pleiotropic genome, coupled with a high error rate, lead to a high mutational load (Elena and Moya 1999 ) that leaves little room for the limitless adaptability some have attributed to RNA viruses. Indeed, mutation rates are so high that it is possible that even highly beneficial mutations will not be able to spread through a viral population because they are, by chance, linked to deleterious mutations that arise in the same genome. This will evidently hinder their ability to emerge in new hosts and does much to explain why some RNA viruses are better able to cross species barriers than others. As such, we propose that the true importance of the nearly neutral (or slightly deleterious) theory of molecular evolution (Ohta 1992 (Ohta , 1998 to the study of RNA viruses has not been fully appreciated, yet may be crucial to fully understanding emergence.",19.849814401117783,9.11852300874068

In the most extreme example, genetic bottlenecks can result in inefficient natural selection and rapid genetic drift (see also the chapter by Escarmís et al., this volume). This can result in the random fixation of mutations that can be deleterious for an organism without sufficient recombinatorial capacity or opportunity, resulting in progressive fitness declines via Muller's ratchet; such effects have been demonstrated for the arboviruses VSV (Duarte et al. 1992) and EEEV (Weaver et al. 1999) . Genetic drift can also facilitate the sampling of novel phenotypes, which cannot be selected in a step-wise fashion due to the lack of intermediate genotypes with improved fitness and the complexity of the selective landscape. A small population size could therefore be essential to allowing certain mutants to persist in nature. When bluetongue virus was placed in a laboratory transmission cycle involving Culicoides sonorensis vectors and sheep or calves, individual gene segments appeared to evolve independently by genetic drift in a host-specific fashion (Bonneau et al. 2001 ). In one case, a unique variant was randomly ingested by C. sonorensis insects that fed on a low titer blood meal, representing a genetic bottleneck, thereby fixing this new genotype by a founder effect. Additional studies of this kind are needed to assess the effects of blood meal titers on introducing bottlenecks leading to founder effects and genetic drift.",41.81210837565319,18.98391870092213

Such mutations would then render these avian viruses transmissible between humans, as it is feared to happen with the H5N1 avian flu virus. It must be emphasized that in the case of the new H7N9 virus this has already partially happened. The amoral reality is that influenza viruses are so unpredictable because they use sophisticated and effi-cient methods of molecular evolution, adaptation and crossspecies transmission. One method is called ''reassortment'' or ''genetic shift,'' which is the mixing of the gene segments from different influenza viruses. Another method is called ''genetic drift,'' which is the constant introduction of mutations into the influenza genome with an unpredictable impact on the phenotype of the newly mutated influenza virus.

Mutations can be fixed in populations by genetic drift or natural selection. Prediction in the case of genetic drift is necessarily hindered by a large sampling error. Although natural selection is a deterministic process, which ought to engender it with some inherent predictability, this will only be possible if the fitness of each relevant mutation is known in each relevant environment. For example, early attempts to predict the evolution of influenza virus as a guide for vaccine strain selection using the differential strength of positive selection among viral lineages gained little traction [9] . Although predictions are more robust when selection is extremely strong -it is trivial to predict that resistance (and often the causative mutations) will arise to commonly used antivirals -predictions of the evolution of more complex multi-factorial traits such as host adaptation and emergence are a very different matter [10, 11] . Even for traits where single mutations might confer a major fitness advantage, such as antiviral resistance, genome-scale interactions, including epistasis [ Fortunately, there are some evolutionary generalities that enable very broad-scale predictions about viral emergence, although none possess meaningful precision. One of the best established is that viruses are more likely to jump between closely related species [15, 16••] . Although informative, numerous exceptions arise because the probability of exposure does not match phylogenetic relatedness. For example, although humans are more closely related to other primates than to rodents, we probably have greater exposure to the latter. It is equally well known that RNA viruses jump species boundaries more often than DNA viruses and that this likely reflects their differing rates of evolutionary change [8, 17] . RNA viruses have mutation rates of between 0.1 -1.0 mutations per genome replication, several logs higher than those of double-strand DNA viruses, and which will generate abundant genetic variation when coupled with huge population sizes [17] . Although there is some variation in evolutionary rate among RNA viruses, this does not appear to be related to the propensity to jump hosts. Interestingly, single-stranded DNA viruses exhibit rates of evolutionary change similar to those of RNA viruses [17] and may frequently cross species boundaries [18] . Similarly, although rates of recombination (or reassortment) vary greatly among viruses, these appear to be of little predictive power: as a case in point, paramxyoviruses, such as measles and the emerging henipaviruses, experience extremely low rates of recombination (if they recombine at all) yet frequently jump species [19] .",26.65729073364957,12.02190944043595

First, to better understand and predict parallel adaptation, and apply it to the specific scenario of virus emergence, we need a model that describes how the phenomenon depends on factors such as mutation rates, population sizes, selection coefficients and genome evolvability. Second, improvements in statistical methods and software are needed to make it easier to test parallel evolution hypotheses in the correct way. Advances have been made in testing specific phenomena associated with parallel evolution, such as coevolution [61] and episodic selection [28, 30] ; however, an integrated inference framework that maximises the accuracy of site identification, and is robust to confounding processes such as recombination and genetic hitchhiking is still required. New high throughput experimental approaches, such as deep mutational scanning, have been applied to virus pathogens and will provide more comprehensive information on the mutability of virus proteins [62 ,63] . Results from similar empirical approaches, combined with the rapid growth of genome sequences for viruses from multiple hosts and ecosystems, will provide a broader evidence base for virus parallel evolution during virus emergence.",24.488594965199887,11.866482004146864

Several methods are available to undertake such calculations [28] [29] [30] .

It is for this reason that the attenuation of myxoma virus (MYXV) following its introduction as a biological control into the European rabbit populations of Australia and Europe, within which virulence grade was carefully measured, has become the textbook example of virulence evolution [47] . Critically, MYXV involves a species jump, albeit one mediated by humans; the natural host for this virus is the South American tapeti (Sylvilagus brasiliensis) in which the virus causes only mild tumours, whereas severe myxomatosis appears when the virus infects nonresistant European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), although intermediate levels of virulence (which maximized transmission rate) ultimately dominated in the field [47] . An analysis of the genome-scale evolution of MYXV from the original releases in the 1950s in both Australia and Europe to modern wild strains revealed that changes in virulence involved multiple genes, with no mutations common to specific virulence grades [48•] . Hence, despite the similarity in selection pressures in both Australia and Europe, there are multiple genetic routes to attain either highly virulent or attenuated phenotypes in MYXV. Such flexibility sits in stark contrast to RNA viruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) in which a single amino acid substitution increases virulence and has evolved convergently multiple times during the history of WNV [49] . The difference between MYXV and WNV suggests a more profound relationship between virulence evolution and genome size, in which there is greater scope for virulence determining mutations in larger DNA-based organisms, from which evolutionary trade-offs between virulence and transmission rate can be optimized at the ecological scale, while these trade-offs appear in RNA viruses because of limited genomic flexibility such that the same mutations affect both virulence and transmissibility. Hence, it is possible that there will only ever be a limited number of virulence determining mutations in RNA viruses.",21.424332453066008,10.15968879624095

Once inside the cell, the bitterness due to FPs may be amplified, since they have their own unique proteinous feature which can lead to functional disorder of the attached protein of interest.

We can understand their importance and interaction by considering four basic properties of RNA virus populations. First, RNA viruses often have very large population sizes, such that the number of viral particles in a given organism might be as high as 10 12 . Second, such immense population sizes, which are several orders of magnitude larger than those observed for cellular organisms, are a product of explosive replication. For example, a single infectious particle can produce an average of 100,000 viral copies in 10 hours. As natural selection is most efficient with large populations, it is no surprise that experiments using RNA viruses have shown that selection is of fundamental importance in controlling their evolutionary dynamics, such that new mutants with increased FITNESS (as measured by their selection coefficient, s) continually appear and out-compete older, inferior alleles 4 . Third, owing to the lack of proofreading activity in their polymerase proteins, RNA viruses exhibit the highest mutation rates of any group of organisms, approximately one mutation per genome, per replication 5, 6 . Finally, the genome sizes of RNA viruses are typically small, ranging from only 3 kb to ~30 kb, with a median size of 9 kb. These last two properties are intimately related because high-mutation rates are theoretically expected to limit genome size. In particular, a mutation rate that exceeds a notional ERROR THRESHOLD (set at approximately the reciprocal of the genome size) generates so many deleterious mutations in each replication cycle that even the fittest viral genomes are unable to reproduce, and population size decreases to extinction 7, 8 .

One important question, which also relates to the mechanics of viral evolution in general, is whether drug-resistance mutations have a fitness cost compared with wild-type alleles in the absence of the drug. If there is a fitness cost, we would hypothesize that resistance mutations would not reach high frequencies in populations, despite their benefit to the virus in hosts. There is evidence that, in the absence of the drug, HIV strains harbouring drug-resistant mutations are less fit than wild-type HIV strains 118 .

Viruses in nature are subjected to pressures exerted by the immune response and by infection of specific cell types, and although mutations accumulate and quasispecies may form, biological pressure limits the fitness of viruses that might be able to replicate in a less stringent system. Removing this pressure through propagation in cell culture, particularly in deficient cell lines like Vero cells, results in 'freedom' for mutant viruses to accumulate to a greater extent than would be possible in vivo. These mutant viruses may be more effectively targeted by the immune system, and are therefore attenuated when reintroduced into a host animal. A specific example is provided by the adaptation of vaccine strains of measles virus. While gaining fitness for replication in cell culture, these viruses no longer need to antagonize and evade the innate immune defenses, as this immune pressure is not present in many cell culture systems. These tissue culture-passaged viruses therefore undergo regressive evolution and mutations arise in both the P and V proteins, which allow the wild-type virus to inhibit type I and type II interferon signaling, and the adapted virus loses its pathogenicity in rhesus macaques (Bankamp et al., 2008) .",13.227567699694744,8.387238190075198

First, there is extensive convergent and parallel evolution (both in genotype and in phenotype) across lineages replicating in the same host, perhaps reflecting the fact that relatively few sites are free to vary when genome sizes are small. Second, advantageous mutations that are fixed early on when viruses are challenged with new environments confer the largest fitness benefit. Third, phenotypic evolution tends to mirror the evolution of fitness increments, with large changes occurring early in new environments. Fourth, rates of nucleotide substitution remain approximately constant through time. Fifth, overall genetic diversity remains low during the phase of maximum fitness increase and rises once fitness becomes asymptotic. Sixth, evolutionary changes that increase fitness in one host often, although not always, reduce fitness in an alternative host. Seventh, population bottlenecks and spatial heterogeneity lead to an increase in unique nucleotide substitutions. Finally, severe reductions in population size can lead to the accumulation of deleterious mutations and consequent fitness losses.",16.816981437421035,7.776516593412227

Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is the major viral surface glycoprotein that mediates binding and entry of the virus to host cells and is a primary target of neutralizing antibody responses [2] . HA-specific antibodies can inhibit infection by blocking viral attachment to sialic acid residues of surface proteins on host cells, interfering with the structural transition of HA that triggers fusion activity in the endosome, or by simultaneous inhibition of attachment and virus-cell fusion [3] .

Other EBOV variants include EBOV Yambuku (Mayinga) from 1976, EBOV Kikwit from 1995, and EBOV Lomela from 2014 (DRC). The between-outbreak evolutionary rate therefore reflects estimates averaged across all EBOV variants. rate', which describes the frequency that mutations are fixed in populations through time and for EBOV is best approximated by the rate observed between outbreaks (Box 1) 61 . This rate reflects the long-term evolutionary process of selective constraints on the genome, host species-specific adaptation and the cumulative results of genetic drift. The rate of change within outbreaks might be better thought of as the 'evolutionary rate' as the short time-scale of sampling necessarily means that not all mutations observed will be fixed. Both the substitution rate and evolutionary rate can be clearly distinguished from the 'mutation rate'. This term relates to the rate at which mutations are generated during viral replication by intrinsic biochemical factors, particularly how frequently the viral polymerase makes errors 78 (Box 1). This rate is generally challenging to measure 79, 80 and is unknown for most viruses, including EBOV. It is therefore unfortunate that the debate over EBOV evolution has focused on 'mutation' (and hence potential differences intrinsic to particular virus lineages) when this is not the parameter that has been measured.",29.188511795684597,12.188210337767716

First, estimates of evolutionary rate are generally expected to be higher within than between outbreaks. This is because the relatively short time-scale over which sequences are sampled during outbreaks may be insufficient for mutations to be removed (or less likely be fixed) by either natural selection or genetic drift. Hence, pathogen genomic sequences sampled early within epidemics will contain an excess of mildly deleterious variants that would eventually be eliminated by purifying selection 61 . This will tend to inflate evolutionary rates and in part explains why evolutionary rates in RNA viruses are often 'time-dependent': high toward the present, low toward the past 71, 72 . Indeed, it is notable that as the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic progressed analyses of evolutionary rate in EBOV converged on a reliable estimate (Fig. 2) , which is expected due to the increasing size of the data set combined with a longer sampling period. When viewed in the context of viruses as a whole, it is also striking that all the evolutionary rate estimates for EBOV fall in a narrow range towards the center of a distribution that spans more than three orders of magnitude, from ~1 0 −2 to ~1 0 −5 subs/site/year (Fig. 2) .",22.889336996258645,11.579447317663304

The branch length of a tree may define either the amount of change fixed or the time passed between two nodes connected in a tree, and is known as 'additive' or 'ultrametric', respectively.

Variations resulting in evolutionary changes are both a consequence of modifications in the genome and the result of environmental pressures placed on the virus. Factors determining genetic variability of coronaviruses include point mutations and recombination events. The lack of proof-reading in RNA polymerases is thought to be responsible for the high frequencies of point mutations among the RNA viruses, and provides a mechanism for antigenic and pathogenic evolution (Holland et al., 1982) . More rapid modifications in the genetic composition of many viruses, including coronaviruses, may occur as a result of recombination events (Lai, 1992) . Under experimental conditions, both in vitro and in vivo, RNA recombination between mouse coronavirus genomes in the presence and absence of selective biological pressure has been well documented (Lai et al., 1985; Makino et al., 1986; Banner and Lai, 1991; Liao and Lai, 1992) . Such exchanges of genetic information could be a critical mechanism for the survival of coronaviruses in nature. A consequence of rapid variation could be the frequent occurrence of IBV-related disease in vaccinated animals (personal observations). In fact, recombination events in the Sl involving serologically distinct Ark-like and Mass-like strains have been shown to occur in naturally evolving IBV strains that have been implicated with severe disease in chickens immunized with a Mass-like vaccine (Wang et al., 1993) .

A summary of mutations detected thus far is shown in Fig. 1 . Based on the crystallographic structure of the H-2D b molecule and on mutagenesis studies (Hudrisier et al., 1996; Young et al., 1994) , some of these mutations are predicted to affect binding to the MHC class I molecule, whereas others inhibit binding to the TCR of the CD8 T lymphocyte. Mutations in epitope S-510-518 are selected within 10-12 days postinfection, a time at which virus is not cleared in other MHV infections (Houtman and Fleming, 1996a; Lin et al., 1999) . Detection of CTL escape mutants at a time before virus clearance is expected to be complete is consistent with a role for these mutants in virus persistence. Notably, epitope S-510-518-specific CTL activity can be detected in the CNS as early as 5 days postinfection, prior to the detection of CTL escape mutants (unpublished observations). Mutations are also not detected in infected mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID mice), suggesting that their selection is CD8 T cell-driven (Pewe, Xue, and Perlman, 1997) . In this model, mice that do not develop hind-limb paralysis by 60-80 days postinfection remain asymptomatic.

The HA and NA are encoded in distinct genomic segments, so that reassortment of HA and NA variants can occur readily. However, the resulting viruses appear to need a balance between the HA Sia-binding and NA Sia-cleaving activities, which may be accomplished by coevolution of either or both genes [54] . It has been shown that sialidases from many pathogens (bacterial and influenza) have optimal enzymatic activities for /2,3-linked Neu5Ac Sia, and the shift to the /2,6 linkage, hydroxylation of Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc, or addition of O-acetyl groups to C4, 7, or 9 reduce the capacity of sialidases to cleave in vitro [44, 55, 56] . The natural in vivo activity of human or avian influenza NA towards modified Sia appears to be consistently reduced, while 'drift' in linkage specificity has been observed over large influenza evolutionary timescales [57] . It appears that, for influenza viruses, HA compensatory mutations are commonly used to avoid inhibitory or 'decoy' Sias, rather than changes in the sialidase specificity of NA, and also that sialidases cannot readily gain the ability to avoid inhibition by at least the 4-O-Ac Sia [58] . Similarly, NA resistance alleles to sialidase inhibitors (e.g., Oseltamivirresistant influenza) can arise, but may require favorable compensatory epistatic alleles in HA to allow fixation [59, 60] . For example, mutations that allow human influenza viruses to replicate in the presence of high levels of 4-O-Ac Sia occurred in the Sia binding site of the HA and prevented HA binding to the 4-O-Ac Sia. Those mutations were seen in the H3N8 and H7N7 equine influenza viruses, as well as in human influenza viruses experimentally adapted to grow in the presence of horse serum proteins [58] . It is not known whether selection of mutations in HA to avoid these inhibitory modified Sias also alters HA receptor binding specificities for other Sias, or alters antigenic epitopes, and thereby shapes the adaptive potential of the viruses in different hosts. However, it is likely that the relative abundance of modified Sia forms in different hosts contributes to host-specific HA and NA selection, and may also constrain the relative transmission potential in novel emergent viruses.",17.099042035985107,9.354259143518249

This necessitates redesigning and updating of the vaccines to include the new antigenic variants. Compared to DNA viruses, RNA viruses are more prone to such changes due to their inherent biology, such as segmented genome and possibility of exchange of genes from related virus types resulting into recombination and reassortment. These changes in influenza viruses are described as antigenic drift (gradual minor changes) and antigenic shift (major antigenic alterations). Thus, the need for continuous surveillance and monitoring of virus types in the population and updating of the vaccines becomes a costly and time-consuming proposition. It would be appropriate here to mention the phenomenon of 'antigenic sin' in case of influenza viruses where the infection of a new type of virus may give rise/boost up a detectable HI antibody response against a previous heterologous type/subtype infection.

Thus, fitness landscapes can only be assigned to very narrow experimental conditions that often do not reflect the dynamic nature of the infected individual. A genotype that could be considered of high fitness in one tissue (fitness peak) may represent a lower fitness genotype in another tissue (plateau or valley in the new fitness landscape). Indeed, a substantial difficulty in measuring and monitoring fitness in the context of a more complex infection model, particularly in whole host organisms, is disentangling the population dynamics that occur when a virus is colonizing new tissues or transmitting between hosts. In these situations, the relative fitness of individual viruses or the overall virus population will be influenced by the relative population size as it fluctuates through any number of population bottlenecks: selection acts intensely on large populations, while small populations are more significantly impacted by stochastic events in genetic drift.

The complete genome of the strain was sequenced and analyzed. The results show that the genome of QY16 consists of 27,670 nucleotides, excluding poly (A) tail, and that its genome organization is 5' UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3' UTR-poly (A) tail. Sequence comparison among QY16 and other IBV strains was conducted and its results demonstrate that the S1 gene of QY16 has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with that of 4/91, and the other part of its genome is highly similar to that of YX10. The results of the phylogenic analysis show that the entire genome of QY16 and most of the QY16 genes are located in the same cluster as those of YX10, except for the S1 gene which is located in the same cluster with that of 4/91. It has been further confirmed by the RDP and SimPlot analysis that QY16 is a recombinant strain deriving from YX10 (as the major parental sequence) and 4/91 (as the minor parental sequence), and that the recombination occurs in a region which includes the 3'-terminal 1b sequence (85 nt) and the 5'-terminal S1 protein gene sequence (1,466 nt). The results of the vaccination-challenge test suggest that QY16 is a nephropathogenic strain of IBV and that the vaccine strains-H120 and 4/91-cannot provide effective protection against it. These results indicate that the continuing evolution of IBV strains by genetic drift and genetic recombination may lead to IBV outbreaks even among the vaccinated chickens in China.",15.984554342470474,10.001351934884655

There have been several comparisons of rates of evolution for viruses that document the differences between RNA and DNA viruses (Jenkins et al., 2002; Hanada et al., 2004; Domingo, 2007) . As was the case for mutant spectra (Section 3.3 in Chapter 3), some DNA viruses attain rates of evolution in nature that are very similar to those typical of RNA viruses (Duffy and Holmes, 2008) .

It is unclear to us how much surveillance has benefitted although the mutation information has been used in monitoring [14, 15] . As we and others have pointed out, there is a danger of focusing on the exact mutations discovered in the ferret experiments because there may be other genetic routes to human transmissibility [10] . Some have noted that by the time such mutations have been detected in avian populations, it might be too late to stop the spread due to the relative rates with which we can identify those mutations using current technology and the rate of spread of influenza virus [16, 17] . Increased awareness of the threat of H5N1, however, must certainly have led to better isolation of patients who have been exposed to the virus.

Genetic diseases are caused by mutations in genes. In some cases, such as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), the disease can be caused by a variety of mutations in one gene, or by one or more mutations in several genes. The diagnosis of HNPCC in a particular family is, in part, based on molecular genetic testing for germline mutations in one of the mismatch-repair (MMR) genes. Typically, patients are being tested for mutations in two or more out of four candidate genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2; see review of HNPCC on www. genetests.org). However, other genes involved in the MMR pathway have been reported to be associated with HNPCC (e.g. MLH2, MLH3, PMS1, MSH3, MSH5, MYH; see OMIM entries on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/ query.fcgi?dbZOMIM), and the number of genes identified as being involved in familial colorectal cancer is expected to grow. Some of these newly identified genes might soon be included on the shortlist for routine testing, and, as various patents have been filed, it is possible that overlapping patents might occur on the genetic data necessary to test for HNPCC. Should a patent thicket arise, an HNPCC patent pool, encompassing essential genomic patents, could help to eliminate the thicket and render proprietary genomic data more accessible for use. Additionally, such a patent pool should be considered a dynamic model with regard to both size and use, whereby the size and content of the pool will differ over time: competition law requires that additional essential patents, once granted, will enter the pool (e.g. relating to other genes with a role in the same pathology and on particular mutations in those genes) and others will disappear when no longer valid. Furthermore, the granting of licenses to a subset of patents should also be possible. Here, some genetic laboratories offering testing for the clinical condition as a whole might be interested in the entire pool, whereas other laboratories might only be interested in a license to a subset of patents in the pool, a subset of disease genes or mutations (which are of specific interest in view of the geographical heterogeneity of the distribution of mutations), a specific gene, or a particular mutation for the development of an antibody or another therapeutic or research tool.

The enzyme, previously bound to the DNA probe, triggers the catalysis of a redox reaction and further generates an electrochemical change due to the hybridization event. Lumley-Woodyear et al. monitored the duplex formation with a carbon fiber transducer, using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled DNA-target [99] . The resulting electrorreduction of H 2 O 2 was followed by amperometry, with single base-pair resolution. An ingenious strategy was developed for detection of single-base DNA mutations by using a biotinylated nucleotide complimentary to a mutated residue in the DNA-target [100] ; the subsequent binding of an avidin-bound alkalin phosphatase promotes a chemical reaction that generates a precipitate. By opposition, the non-mutated DNA-target molecule does not bind the enzyme conjugate and, therefore, does not generate the precipitate. In this study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and QCM were employed for the analysis of the Tay-Sachs genetic disorder, reaching a detection limit of 10 −14 M with no PCR pre-amplification. Efficient amplification schemes were achieved by labeling peroxidase with liposomes, with impedimetric detection, to detect PCR products with pulse techniques, as well as sequences related with human cytomegalovirus [101, 102] .

In this light, we isolated, cultured, and characterized primary LECs from multiple ferret tissues, and determined their responsiveness to known TLR ligands by measuring the production of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNAs using real time RT-PCR. In addition, we also cloned and sequenced ferret LEC marker partial cDNAs for in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis to probe the lymphatic vasculature in ferret tissues. Altogether, these findings provide insight into the function and microanatomy of ferret lymphatics and establish a foundation for examination of the roles of LECs during infection and immunization.",17.715006930218095,8.877511197234277

As a result, the genome regions coding for proteins targeted by the immune response (antigens) present much higher variability than the remainder of the genome. Antigenic driftantigenic evolution in influenza A virusexemplifies this phenomenon and should not be confused with genetic drift. Due to the interaction between influenza A virus and the human immune system, mutations accumulate in antigenic regions encoding surface proteins such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Influenza A viruses show episodic selection, that is, positive selection over long periods interspersed with purifying selection over short time periods. This process might explain the new seasonal antigenic variants of influenza A virus (Rambaut et al. 2008; Cobey and Koelle 2008; McHardy and Adams 2009) .

Such experiments can also address important knowledge gaps, such as how often adaptive mutations can be produced in the reservoir host or in new hosts, which selective pressures promote or prevent fixation of adaptive mutations, the frequency of parallel and convergent evolution, and the trajectory of adaptive evolution. Intensive sequencing of replicate viral strains and evolutionary lines can reveal the extent of adaptive constraints and the impact of genetic diversity and population bottlenecks on evolutionary trajectories. The design of experimental evolution experiments is challenging. In a recent experimental evolution study of influenza H3n2, the combination of viral gene sequence data of evolved viral populations with measures of virulence, tissue tropism and pathology revealed adaptive mutations that enabled the evolved population to replicate faster and to higher titres in mouse lungs and other tissues and cell types 110 . This evolution experiment involved serial lung-lung passaging in mice, starting with intranasal infection, harvesting the virus from the lungs of infected animals and subsequent infection of naive mice with homo genized lung tissue. This method was appropriate for the goals in this study, but the homo genization procedure reduces the evolution experiment to a single lineage, which does not allow drawing any conclusions about the adaptation or adaptive constraints of other lineages. It is also noteworthy that the evolved viral population did not transmit well in experimental transmission assays, illustrating that the selection procedure (extracting the virus from lungs and administering it directly to naive mice) did not impose selection on transmission traits and, again, that within-host fitness may not predict between-host fitness. Although this type of experimental design is useful for identifying adaptive mutations and linking them to specific functions, it does not impose selective pressures that are likely to be present in nature and thus does not facilitate the identification of genetic markers that would confer adaption in the wild.",21.02998923674094,13.04199447428389

Hence, during this period, natural selection and demographic changes, such as expansions and bottlenecks, acting on either the viral or the host population will affect the evolution of the virus. After the viral populations are connected again, gene flow, recombination, or reassortment will influence the evolution of the virus, leading to a ""mixture"" at the genome level. Although selection and demographic changes still act during the reconnection, the other processes act more intensely and rapidly. This mixture impacts on diversity at the genome level: isolated populations have evolved independently, diverging and adapting to the specific conditions of their host populations. After reconnection, the diversity that has accumulated separately increases, which also leads to higher adaptive potential since recombination and reassortment allow the combination of polymorphisms selected in different environments into the same genome. If these polymorphisms are compatible in that particular genomic context, this opens the opportunity for the development of new features which might have not developed (or do so only after very long periods) by just mutation and selection. The second consequence of this shared genetic diversity is a progressive trend toward the homogenization of the populations.

These features (including high mutation rates, large population sizes, and recombination or reassortment) facilitate the emergence of de novo resistance mutations. In the absence of drug-selective pressures, resistance mutations may be deleterious or, occasionally, neutral, which implies that their evolution will be governed mainly by genetic drift. For this reason, in the absence of treatment, drug-resistant variants are usually found as minority variants that increase their relative frequency in the population only in the presence of antiviral drugs. Hence, the possibility of transmission of resistance mutations between hosts must be taken into account in order to predict the effectiveness of a particular antiviral therapy. Next-generation sequencing is necessary to detect resistance variants at low frequencies prior to the start of treatment. The development of drug resistance may depend on the presence of various permissive mutations in the same haplotype in order to decrease the genetic barrier (Wilson et al. 2016; Pybus and Rambaut 2009; Chabria et al. 2014) .",26.644968601074936,12.326986201805365

Thus, searches for genetic markers of host jumps often begin with large-scale genetic analyses of viral samples from many host species [27] [28] [29] [30] . This identifies genetic differences of viruses in different host species but does not give information about which markers may be linked to adaptation: genetic differences between viral strains can arise in the new host as a consequence of founder effects and neutral evolution (fIG. 1a) . Thus, the next step is to test whether amino acids at marker sites are the product of positive selection in the new host species [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] to predict which markers are linked to adaptation (fIG. 1b-d). However, these predictions require experimental validation because most sequence-based methods of identifying positive selection rely on the assumption that non-synonymous mutations have much larger fitness effects than synonymous mutations, which can be false, especially in viruses. Indeed, viruses are known to adapt to selective pressures such as tRnA levels, polymerase efficiency controlled by secondary structuring in viral genomic RnA, RnA folding energy and changes in promoter sequences, through positive selection on synonymous mutations [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Thus, although a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations that is greater than 1 may indeed be indicative of positive selection, the opposite ratio is not necessarily indicative of negative selection, but could be the result of positive selection of a synonymous mutation (depending on the type of selective pressure). Screens for genetic markers of host adaptation should therefore include investigation of the primary sequence. Protein-based methods are a promising alternative to avoid reliance on this assumption 35 but they are less well developed, and some require detailed organism-specific knowledge of protein evolutionary patterns, making them less accessible. Furthermore, a recent analysis showed that bioinformatic methods for identifying adaptive substitutions can have high rates of false positives or miss important adaptive changes 42 . Thus, experiments that directly measure the viral fitness effects of mutations are important to show adaptation, and, as discussed below, even more data are needed to confirm whether particular genetic markers of adaptation are drivers of host jumps (and therefore that the host jumps are not due to adaptive fine-tuning, disconfirming the mechanism in In addition to confirming whether host speciesassociated genetic markers are linked to selection, it is crucial to experimentally determine adaptive evolutionary pathways and constraints. In host jumps such as the emergence of feline panleukopenia virus in dogs (now considered a separate viral species, canine parvovirus), cell culture experiments indicate that multiple genetic changes need to occur together in the receptor binding Selective pressures environmental conditions, either biotic or abiotic, that decrease genetic variation by excluding deleterious mutations or increasing the frequency of beneficial mutations. In viruses, these pressures operate at two main scales: within hosts (through cell receptor structure and host immune response) and between hosts (through host contact rates and population heterogeneity in immunity).",17.97539212714533,11.383656700887432

It was anticipated that this could be a particular problem when expressing heterologous sequences, since their presence, far from conferring a selective advantage on the virus, tends to reduce the rate of virus replication. Thus, the inserted sequence tends to be subjected to both genetic drift and deletion. Indeed, when RNA viruses were first mooted as potential vectors, there was some debate as to whether they would be of any practical use for the expression of foreign proteins (van Vloten-Doting et al., 1985; Siegel, 1985) . However, studies on the stability of both constructs containing either whole genes or expressing peptides indicate that these problems will be manageable, provided excessive passaging is not undertaken (Kearney et al., 1993 (Kearney et al., , 1999 Porta et al., 1994) .",22.13028786850712,11.166128927424147

However, gene overlapping leads to hypersensitivity to deleterious mutations (i.e., an increase in the deleterious effects of mutations in overlapping genome regions) as they affect more than one gene. Therefore, strong purifying selection operates in these regions, resulting in a reduced evolutionary rate and adaptation in RNA viruses.

They are sensitive and capable of handling large numbers of samples. In addition, the samples need not to be separated into their constituent lg isotypes. Obviously, the reliability of these tests depends largely upon their isotype specificity. which has to be demonstrated for each reagent and each test. This means that isotype specificity should be checked in the test under study or a similar test with the same sensitivity and that it is not sufficient to check specificity of antisera in less sensitive tests, such as immunodiffusion or immunoelectrophoresis. For instance, m earlier experiments with conventional antisera against bovine lg (Big) isotypes, we observed marked cross-reactions in ELISAs although the antisera appeared to be monospecific in immunodiffusion tests (see also Sloan and Butler, 1978: Townsend et al., 1982) . An inherent problem in isotype-specific ELISAs is the competition that occurs. This rnay be between isotypes (inter-isotype competition), when anti-lg isotype-specific reagents are used as conjugate, or within an isotype (intra-isotype competition) when anti-lg isotype-specific reagents are used as the capturing antibodies (Chantler and Diment, 1981) . Thus, in the former case a (weak) IgA or igM response may be missed due to the presence of competing IgG. In the latter case samples containing equal amounts of specific antibody of a particular isotype may yield different results in ELISAs if the ratio of the specific antibody to the total amount of this isotype differs in these samples. The extent of inter-isotype competition appears to be influenced by antibody concentration and affinity and to vary with the antigen under study (Filice et al., 1980; Townsend et al., 1982) .",19.274004233901422,11.126076416729543

Therefore, it was a surprise when the first large-scale genome comparisons of MYXv revealed that virulence grades changed frequently across the virus phylogeny, as depicted in the phylogeny, and that different mutations appeared in the Australian and European epidemics (depicted as different filled shapes at branch tips), with no parallel evolution of possible virulence determinants within Australia and Europe 94, 145 . For example, there were no mutations that were unique to the most attenuated grade v viruses, nor to the highest virulence grade I viruses. Hence, there are multiple genetic routes to attenuation or virulence in MYXv, such that there has been convergent evolution for phenotype but not genotype, and both attenuating and virulence-restoring mutations have been fixed in Australian MYXv. Therefore, there is no simple way to predict virulence evolution from genome-scale comparisons in the case of MYXv and no parallel or convergent evolution to guide experimentation.

Viral richness estimates in this study surely underestimate the real number of viruses associated with bats, in part due to a lack of population structure estimates for the overwhelming majority of bat species and also incomplete disease surveillance. Models fit to the temporal emergence of viruses suggests that, even for human pathogens, the process of discovery is far from complete (Woolhouse et al., 2008) . A number of recently discovered viruses, in addition to many other previously published associations, could not be included in our data set because they were found in species for which we did not have population genetic structure data or other host socioecological variables. This points to a number of considerations for future studies. First, more bat species should be examined using population genetic markers, and efforts should be made to collect samples for genetic work at the same time that animals are captured and handled during viral surveillance or telemetry studies. Second, more standardized methods for detecting viruses in wildlife reservoirs are needed. The majority of studies target limited taxonomic breadth in viral surveillance efforts, and often serology alone can be problematic due to cross-reactivity (Hanlon et al., 2005; Hayman et al., 2008) . Novel methods, such as multiplex PCR and DNA microarrays, in addition to diverse collaborative research teams, have the capacity to revolutionize the information gained through viral surveillance efforts and will surely advance our understanding of the processes of pathogen richness, coinfection, and emerging bat zoonoses. Lastly, this study highlights the importance of species-specific evolutionary and life-history characteristics for predicting viral richness in wildlife, and this should be examined for other taxonomic groups. This approach could greatly aid pathogen discovery by focusing sampling efforts to host species with potentially greater viral richness and, hence, greater likelihood of harboring novel zoonotic pathogens.",18.58887497621383,10.117673452825963

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to catalog the innumerable genetic traits or strain-related variations that occur in laboratory rats, and the reader is encouraged to consult large electronic databases, such as the National Library of Medicine, for specific and current information on particular genes, strains, and conditions. In addition to known and characterized, spontaneous or induced, genetic variation in rats, isolated colonies of breeding rats inevitably experience some degree of genetic drift. Although this may be monitored to some degree in inbred rats by molecular techniques such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, it is more difficult to assess the degree to which it has occurred in outbred stocks, where expected interindividual variation may obscure intercolony differences. Nonetheless, any two colonies started from the same source will vary increasingly with time unless there is a sufficient and ongoing exchange of breeders between the colonies.

Complete genomic information of the pathogenic viruses circulating in the human population is therefore critical for the effective control of human viral disease. DNA sequencing technologies allow determination of the exact nucleotide sequence of each viral genome, in order to better understand viruses especially in terms of genetic diversity, evolution, pathogenesis, ecology, and vaccine design (Leal and Zanotto, 2000; Djikeng and Spiro, 2009 ).

For example, the method has been used to analyze evolutionary relationship of pathogenic viruses recently detected in Indonesia such as the West Nile virus, the Coxsackievirus B3 and the Zika virus. The phylogenetic analysis of a West Nile virus revealed that the virus circulating in Indonesia is most closely related (99% nucleotide identity) to the West Nile virus strain (B956) isolated from Uganda that belongs to the lineage 2. There are two main genetic lineages of West Nile virus, lineage 1 and lineage 2. The phylogenetic analysis has also confirmed the relationship of the Indonesian strain with other lineage 2 West Nile virus sequences. West Nile virus is a zoonotic mosquito-transmitted arbovirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The lineage 2 strains have been reported to cause outbreaks in Europe . The phylogenetic analysis of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) detected for the first time in Indonesia showed that the virus is closely related (97% homology) to the CVB3 from Taiwan. The analysis was based on the nucleotide sequence of the VP1 region which is considered as the most reliable method for determination of enterovirus genotype.

Gerson and colleagues estimated that only 2 per cent of the more than 12 million commercial shipments into Canada annually are physically inspected. 58 Pathogens that cause little or no overt signs of illnesses in animals will likely go undetected. The H7N9 avian influenza virus, for example, does not cause apparent illness among farmed birds, thus silent spread puts humans at risk. 59 Trying to predict which virus subtypes circulating among animals that will pose dangers to humans is extremely difficult. 60 Culling and vaccination campaigns may in the short term quell an epidemic, but they have frequently failed to provide lasting solutions. More than 100 million birds were killed throughout Asia in an effort to thwart the spread of H5N1. 61 However, the next wave of H5N1 re-established itself in the same countries and spread to new ones. Poultry vaccination programs in Asia and Egypt did not prevent the re-emergence and spread of H5N1. 62, 63 Indeed, vaccination may spur the evolution of the virus. 64, 65 Whether vaccination programs in China lead to greater genetic diversity of the H5N1 virus and contribute to current strains is one of many questions to consider. 66 Moreover, was a low-pathogenic precursor to H5N1 from wild birds introduced to poultry populations through household or 'backyard' flocks? Or was a precursor introduced through commercial confinement operations? Although backyard flocks may serve as conduits that transfer avian influenza viruses to domestic bird populations, their contribution to the emergence and spread of H5N1 may have been overestimated. In an analysis of a 2004 poultry outbreak of H5N1 in Thailand, Graham and colleagues found the likelihood of outbreaks to be far greater in large-scale commercial operations than in backyard flocks. 67 Additionally, there are numerous routes by which pathogens can be introduced to commercial operations. Studies in Canada, the Netherlands, and Denmark reached similar conclusions. 68 The discovery of H7N9 suggests that current mitigation efforts are failing to prevent the emergence of new, dangerous strains.

A recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) review for the National Academies, ''Sustaining Global Surveillance and Response to Emerging Zoonotic Diseases,'' hits the nail on the head with its recommendations to improve early detection and response to zoonotic diseases, such as influenza. Specifically, they are of the opinion that comprehensive surveillance would be best achieved in the following manner: ''Multidisciplinary teams of professionals that have relevant expertise and field experience would identify populations at risk and causes and risk factors for infection, and then rapidly and widely disseminate this information so that immediate and longer term disease prevention and control interventions can be implemented (IOM/NRC 2009).'' For influenza virus surveillance in swine in the United States, the rationale for a surveillance system includes not only protection of public health, but detection, discovery, and sharing of virus isolates to facilitate updates for vaccines, refine diagnostic assays, and determine the distribution of new influenza strains in swine to inform further policy decisions (USDA/APHIS 2009). In Europe, the Research Programme of the European Commission funded the coordination of the European Surveillance Network for Influenza in Pigs (ESNIP), a group that set out on a coordinated surveillance mission many years earlier, in 2001, with the stated goal of being to first standardize diagnostic techniques used for surveillance and detection of influenza viruses in pigs. Once the initial goals were achieved, the wealth of information from the surveillance efforts was leveraged for a second round of studies (ESNIP 2007) on the epidemiology and evolution of influenza viruses in European pigs and to optimize influenza diagnostic assays for swine (Kyriakis et al. 2010a ). Naturally, a listed rationale for ESNIP 2 is, ''to obtain insights into the public health risk of influenza in swine by monitoring swine for avian influenza viruses and by comparison of influenza viruses in swine and in human populations.'' ESNIP 3 has since been launched to ''…increase the knowledge of the epidemiology and evolution of swine influenza virus in European pigs'' with significant research investment directed toward detailed antigenic and genetic characterization of influenza virus strains isolated from pigs (European Commission 2010).",25.954042988732773,10.990450182756147

This conclusion was supported by serological studies that showed a lack of anti-WNV antibodies in individuals living in New York prior to 1999 (REF. 54 ). Initial studies revealed that the nucleotide sequences of strains found on the eastern seaboard of the United States were similar to the prototype 'New York 1999' (NY99) strain isolated from a flamingo in the Bronx Zoo, and indicated that the NY99 strain spread westward in 2000-2002. Recent studies have shown that a genetic variant termed 'North America' has arisen since 2001 and has replaced NY99 as the dominant genotype present in North America 56 . The 'North America' genotype only differs by 0.18% from NY99, but has characteristic nucleotide and amino-acid substitutions. Other genetic variants have been identified, including a south-east coastal Texas genotype that differs by 0.27% from NY99 and by 0.55% from 'North America', and a Mexican genotype that differs by 0.45% from NY99 (REF. 57 ). Overall, these data might indicate a lack of Darwinian selection in the evolution of a particular genetic variant, and support genetic drift of the virus during its dissemination across North America. Consistent with this hypothesis, the southeast coastal Texas genotype was only isolated in 2002 from the Texas-Louisiana border, and might have become extinct.

While the remaining important tools are utilized by diagnostic virology laboratories today, these techniques are time-consuming and require specific reagents/methods such as cultivation media, cell or tissue cultures, antibodies, or purified antigens. In the past several decades, the number of new molecular-based methods increased rapidly and became widely used in diagnostic virology laboratories. The core of these techniques constitutes of techniques based on nucleic acid detection by specific amplification, hybridization, and/or sequencing (reviewed in [1] ). The majority of these nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods are simple, speedy, sensitive, and specific and thus meet the gold ""four-S standard"" for their application in any diagnostic laboratory. The methods are simple and speedy because only a specific primer pair and a PCR machine are required by the laboratory, and identification of a viral pathogen takes only a few hours. They are sensitive and specific and require only a small amount of patient's clinical specimen to detect a specific nucleotide sequence region. In general, these techniques can be used to detect almost all types of viral pathogens and can even identify multiple viral pathogens or their variants at the same time. In this chapter, we will focus on detection of viral RNA splicing as a new tool for diagnostic virology. ",19.7303526354823,10.676970408712599

This contradicts the hypothesis that arboviruses are constrained in their evolutionary potential 87 . Surprisingly, VSV populations that are specialized for replication in vertebrate cells showed fitnessincreases for replication in sandfly cells, indicating a lack of specificity in some adaptation events. Further study of these model systems is needed to determine if alternating passages generate mutations that increase fitness in both cell types, or if they generate a polymorphic population with host-cell-specific adaptive mutations. Recent in vivo experiments have produced results that contradict the cell-culture experimental models of arbovirus evolution. When VEEV was placed into a laboratory transmission cycle -consisting of ten cycles in hamsters alternating with ten cycles in A. aegypti mosquitoes -genetic stability of the virus isolates was observed, and virus fitness was either reduced or unchanged. However, specialization for replication in the hamster host resulted in rapid increases in virus fitness with many mutations, consistent with virus adaptation and evolutionary constraints imposed by the alternating-host cycle of arboviruses 88 .

The evolution of diagnostics for SARS has been different from that of most viruses. The need for a BSL-3 facility for virus isolation and difficulty in culturing the virus from infected individuals late in the outbreak (possibly as a result of genetic drift of the virus) precluded the use of culture for diagnosis in most outbreak settings. Furthermore, the late seroconversion, 2 to 4 weeks after infection for most patients, all but eliminates a serological diagnosis for detecting recent infections. The first serological tests used SARS-CoV-infected cells on microscope slides and immunofluorescent staining or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests of crude cell lysates containing SARS-CoV antigens to detect serum antibodies. When used together with multiple specimens, virus isolation and serology proved useful for identifying patients at the beginning of the outbreak; however, they proved less satisfactory for diagnosing new cases in the first few days after onset of symptoms. Initial culturing of a CoV from patients in Hong Kong enabled the early identification of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy and led to the development of the first nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detecting SARS-CoV RNA.

In addition, the S segment of some hantaviruses has another open reading frame named Ns but its product or function remains to be discovered. Viral messenger RNAs of the members of the Bunyaviridae are not polyadenylated and are truncated relative to the genome RNAs at the 3 0 termini. Messenger RNAs have 5 0 -methylated caps and 10-18 nontemplated nucleotides which are derived from host cell mRNAs. The termini of all three segments are conserved and complementary to each other, a feature that has assisted in cloning and discovery of new hantaviruses. Unlike most other Bunyaviridae, hantaviruses are not arthropod-borne (arboviruses), but are ROdent-BOrne, roboviruses. Each hantavirus is primarily carried by a distinct rodent/insectivore species although a few host switches seem to have occurred during the tens of millions of years of their co-evolution with their carrier animals [3] .

Directed evolution mimics the Darwinian evolution process in the test tube, involving repeated cycles of generating genetic diversity by random mutagenesis or gene recombination, and screening or selecting functionally improved or novel protein variants. Directed evolution has been successfully used to tailor a wide variety of protein properties such as activity, stability, and selectivity. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] However, directed evolution has its own limitations, too. For example, the use of microorganisms in directed evolution to link the protein activity with its genetic code imposes an upper limit on the protein variant library size that can be sieved through. This limit is generally lower than 10 10 , which is the potential library size that would be generated if a typical protein (300 amino acids) were to be diversified with three randomly introduced point mutations.

Rotaviruses were first identified by electron microscopy in intestinal biopsies of children diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis.12 These viruses consist of non-enveloped, icosahedral particles comprising 11 segments of dsRNA encoding 6 structural (VP1-4, 6, 7) and 6 non-structural proteins (NSP1-613). Cleavage of VP4 leads to VP5* involved in cell penetration, and VP8*, the head of the VP4 spike required for attachment and infection of intestinal cells.14,15 Infection with naturally-occurring Rotavirus strains does not confer immunity but prevents strong diarrhea upon reinfection. Post reinfection, serotypic response is normally broader. Antibody responses are not limited to outer capsid proteins but include also VP2, VP6, NSP2, NSP4.16 Neutralizing IgA specific to VP4 and VP7 prevents adsorption, uncoating and penetration, while VP6-specific IgA prevents intracellular viral replication during transcytosis across enterocytes.13,14 Outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7 are used in P (VP4 protease) and G (VP7 glycoprotein) serotyping and genotyping. Epidemiological studies indicate that Rotavirus diversity changes over the years within and between countries by point mutations (genetic drift) leading to antigenic changes, reassortment within and between animal strains, infections of other species as well as genetic rearrangements.16 A review of the prevalence of Rotavirus strains in 100 reporting nations from 1996 to 2007 noted that strain diversity was associated with accumulation of point mutations driving antigenic drift, genome reassortment and zoonotic transmission. Five genotypes (G1-4, G9) accounted for 88.2% of all strains, with G1 declining from 2000 onwards and G3 re-appearing.

Thus, it is likely that proto-virocells had segmented RNA genomes that often “mated” by combining with other RNA segments.

The ubiquity of the use of RNA primers in the synthesis of DNA and its deoxyribonucleotide precursors from ribonucleotide precursors of RNA (108) is additional support for this argument.

Such a T would allow detection of F even before birth, implantation or, ultimately, even conception of I, using methods for preconception, preimplantation or prenatal genetic testing or risk assessment already in clinical use. That, in turn, would facilitate a P of the same form applied already today for family planning on genetic grounds, using partner, gamete or embryo or foetus selection to avoid possible future Is where F is present. Less probably, it may also provide a basis for therapeutic preventive interventions preconceptionally or prenatally. But, of course, a genetic explanation of crime may also ground other types of P (see further below).",19.037710490268374,11.106908748402859

These evolutionary behaviours are divergent leading to a dynamic and ever changing influenza climate in the human population where one Influenza A subtype typically dominates over the other. Importantly, understanding the interplay between the H1N1 and H3N2 infection evolution remains a significant hurdle in influenza reasearch89. Nelson and colleagues investigated the genetic evolution of the H1N1 virus by analyzing the evolution of the whole virus as well as the individual viral segments from strains since 1918 9. In this study the authors were able to identify instances where divergent clades co-circulated as well as events of intra-H1N1 subtype reassortment9. Previously, Smith and colleagues compared the antigenic and genetic evolution of the H3N2 virus from strains originating in 1968 to 2003 and found that antigenic and genetic evolution showed differing patterns8. Antigenic evolution was punctuated where the strains formed clusters and genetic change was more even and gradual as time increased8. Here we sought to elucidate the antigenic evolution of the H1N1 virus. As with the H3N2 virus8, we found the antigenic change did not vary evenly by year but instead corresponded to genetic changes in the HA molecule. These studies are significant for elucidating the intricacies of influenza evolution as the continuous change of the influenza virus is the greatest challenge to the management of disease and containment of further outbreaks. A better understanding of the evolution of the influenza virus and the interplay between the H3N2 and H1N1 strains will improve the design of prophylactics such as by guiding vaccine strain selection for yearly trivalent influenza vaccine or may even give insight to the development of a universal influenza vaccine.

Moreover, Bris/07 and SI/06 were closer to each other than they were to NCal/99. Interestingly, the antisera generated by infection with NCal/99 did not cross-react with the other two contemporary seasonal H1N1 viruses although the SI/06 and Bris/07 antisera recognized the NCal/09 virus. These results suggested there to be an amino acid change in Bris/07 and SI/06 from NCal/99 that may have resulted in a new antigenic site that was not originally present in NCal/99 strain. To investigate this contention we generated a clustal alignment of these viruses which showed numerous amino acid changes between Bris/07 and SI/06 sequences with NCal/99. These results may indicate the gradual yet still present drift of the H1N1 virus in this time period.

However, these virus-derived sequences could also impact the evolution of virus populations. Here, we used an experimental model system to study the effects of NIRV expression on virus populations, using TEV and transgenic tobacco plants expressing its replicase, NIb. We found that 1) the loss of NIb cistron leads to higher within-host fitness in transgenic plants, 2) that genomic deletions quickly accumulate in a full-length virus passaged in transgenic plants, and 3) that the evolution of a virus population can be contingent upon the deletion of virus genes, although many aspects of phenotypic and molecular evolution were unchanged. Overall, our results therefore suggest that the expression of NIRVs could have far-reaching consequences for virus evolution. Moreover, these effects can occur on relatively short timescales (i.e., deletion variants were generated de novo and reached frequencies of ∼ 0.25 within four 3-week passages). These changes on short timescales support the notion that plausible epidemiological models of virus spread in NIRV-expressing host populations need to take virus evolution into consideration. For example, if large genomic deletions occur rapidly in NIRV-expressing hosts, then eventually many virus-infected hosts will only be infectious to those hosts expressing the NIRV. The generation of various classes of infectious hosts could in this case decrease viral transmission between hosts, an effect that could be further augmented by the clustering of NIRV-expressing hosts.",20.23974638526501,10.472409779535747

This idea is inspired by the empirical observation that a group IV plant virus appears to be stable when short-duration passages are used, but not in long-duration passages (Dolja et al. 1993; Zwart et al. 2014; Willemsen et al. 2016, 2018). Viruses pass through bottlenecks at many points during infection, in vitro and in vivo (Zwart and Elena 2015), it is therefore important to consider these effects. Even if there is a large supply of deletions and strong selection for the deletion mutant, if deletion mutants fail to reach a frequency ≥/α, where α is the bottleneck size, they are unlikely to pass through the bottleneck (Willemsen et al. 2016, 2018). This leads to a ‘resetting’ of the virus population by each bottleneck event (Fig. 1), effectively resulting in high stability of the inserted sequences (Box 1, see also Fig. 2). Short passages shorten the time for deletion mutants to reach the frequency 1/α, making it more difficult for these variants to pass through bottlenecks and hereby promoting insert stability. It is important to remember that assays for detecting deletion mutants, such as deep sequencing or the polymerase chain reaction, do have limited sensitivity. Deletions may therefore also be detected more readily in longer passages, whilst low frequency mutations that will be purged by bottlenecks may not be detected (Bull, Nuismer, and Antia 2019).

In single cell organisms (prokaryotes, archaea, and some fungi), the codon usage is strongly tuned for highly expressed genes and was thus concluded to be optimized for translational efficiency (Sharp et al, 1988).

Still, evidence for codon usage bias toward highly expressed genes and its correlation to tRNA abundance argues that translational efficiency does have a role for some plant, fly, and worm proteomes (Duret, 2000 and references within). Evolutionary forces and multiple molecular processes (e.g., unbiased gene conversion, mutation rates, and genetic drift) have also participated in shaping codon usage in higher eukaryotes (Bernardi, 1986; Duret, 2002). The molecular determinants that have globally influenced the translational efficiency in Escherichia coli (Kudla et al, 2009) and the evolution of polymerase genes in the influenza A virus (Brower-Sinning et al, 2009) indicate that, in addition to GC content, RNA folding processes also affect the adaptability and translational capacity of viral sequences.",18.233915308933106,8.325402211087173

If the number of differences between two sequences accumulating in a given time is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, with λ equal to the expected number of mutations, the probability of finding this number of differences between the two sequences by chance can be calculated from the cumulative density function of the Poisson distribution.

However, such approaches rely on the observation of an allele fre-67 quency at more than two time points so as to distinguish a deterministic model of selection (with an 68 implied infinite effective population size) from a combined model of selection with genetic drift; such 69 approaches cannot be directly applied to the analysis of viral transmission.",22.765745820124653,13.223832288912831

While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3' and 5' UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains.

However, for many systems, it has 29 been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an 30 observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their 31 extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased 32 adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many 33 viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative 34 model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for 35 increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D G64S , has a significant 36 replication defect and that wild type and 3D G64S populations have similar adaptability in two 37 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D G64S under r-selection led to 38 reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D G64S exhibited 39 delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD 50 , consistent with attenuation by slower growth as 40 opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D G64S growth defect 41 restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent 42 with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more 43 important than accuracy.

Similarly, we find that the widely accepted 274 link between within host genetic diversity and virulence is confounded by the fact that faster 275 replicating viruses are both more virulent and have higher mutation rates. The high mutation 276 rates of RNA viruses and the highly deleterious fitness effects of mutations ensure that most 277 genetic diversity is extremely rare and unlikely to be consistently maintained in the face of 278 intrahost and interhost bottlenecks [52]. We do not dispute that virus populations will harbor 279 minority variants, that a subset of these mutations may be adaptive or beneficial to the virus, 280 and that some may be virulence determinants. However, the observation of genetic diversity is 281 not in and of itself evidence that selection has optimized mutation rates for the future benefit of 282 novel mutations. Indeed, our data show little adaptive benefit to a marginally increased mutation 283 rate and identify no plausible mechanism whereby the observed increase in rare genetic 284 diversity can influence pathogenesis.

Based on our previous estimates 5 we assumed Singapore has the highest capacity of surveillance with respect to COVID-19. We regressed the cumulative cases against Wuhan-to-location air travel volume considering Singapore to have the greatest detection capacity and estimating the relative underdetection compared to Singapore in the remaining 190 locations classified according to the GHS 2 index 9 . While it is unlikely that this index reflects the true ranking of countries for any specific epidemic, such as the current one of COVID-19, we assume that it captures different levels of surveillance capacity. We therefore grouped the remaining locations into three big classes high, medium, and low surveillance capacity instead of using exact ranking.",14.821866101955425,8.282251786616712

This approach is similar to that used for the the 2009 influenza pandemic where infections in tourists returning from Mexico were used to estimate the time-specific risk of infection (incidence or cumulative incidence) with the novel pandemic H1N1 influenza strain in Mexico (or parts thereof). The idea was that surveillance for the novel virus was not intense during the early days of the pandemic in Mexico, the source country, and that detection would be far more sensitive in travelers leaving Mexico, who would be screened when returning home as a means of preventing introductions of cases into destination countries 2, 3 . Reports that health systems in Wuhan are overwhelmed and many cases are not being counted have led to the use of outgoing traveler data to estimate the time-specific risk of COVID-19 in Wuhan 4 . This estimate, in turn, has been used to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection by a certain date in Wuhan, and from there (often assuming exponential growth and no appreciable depletion of susceptibles) the cumulative number of cases. Two important assumption underlie this calculation: i) that the detection of cases in the destination country has been 100% sensitive and specific, whether they are detected at the airport (prevalent cases with symptoms) or later after arrival at their destination (cases that were incubating during travel); ii) that travelers have the same prevalence of infection as the average resident of Hubei , so the prevalence inferred in travelers may be directly applied in Hubei. Here we consider the extent to which these two assumptions are justified. We conclude that the first assumption is strongly inconsistent with observed data, resulting in potentially substantial underestimates of prevalence in Hubei and corresponding overestimates of case-severity measures that are normalised by case counts.",10.110297162817954,6.899729058961533

Understanding the causes of antibiotic failure inspires the development of new drugs and informs clinical treatment strategies [3] [4] [5] . These failure mechanisms are broadly classified into three distinct categories (i.e., resistance, 5 persistence, and tolerance), which are characterized by the change in drug concentration and exposure time required to kill bacteria 6 . For example, resistance is characterized by genetic mutations or phenotypic changes which result in bacteria requiring significantly higher concentrations of antibiotic (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) to be lethal. By contrast, bacteria exhibiting tolerance or persistence require increased drug exposure time (minimum 10 duration for killing, MDK), with the latter exhibiting a biphasic killing profile (Fig. 1A) . Further, bacteria populations become tolerant through environmental conditions or genetic mutations, whereas persistence is an actively maintained, non-heritable state exhibited by a subpopulation of bacteria.
