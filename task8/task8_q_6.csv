In Thailand, access to healthcare is limited by the availability of service delivery, particularly health workforce. Despite having extensive networks of healthcare providers, challenges still exist in terms of healthcare provision in remote rural areas where it is difficult to attract and retain qualified health workers. The country has a low doctor-per-population ratio √Å lower than other countries with a similar economic development level-due to an extended period of limited training capacity. Whilst the ratio of nurses to doctors is high, there is still a large discrepancy in the distribution of doctors and nurses across geographical regions, which is a major challenge for the government. In Singapore, the biggest hurdles are not financial or technical but ideological. The fears of moral hazard leading to overconsumption and over-servicing, as well as eventual financial unsustainability are the main reasons why the government is unprepared to embrace UHC in the spirit of other developed countries. Furthermore, there is a sincere belief that wealth and financial success must translate into better quality of living including healthcare √Å 'Work for reward, Reward for work' is a common mantra espoused by government officials (35) . In Malaysia, there are supply side constraints, with significant shortages of health professionals (36) . The MOH reported that they were able to fill just 64% of doctors' posts in 2009, 60% for dentists, and 77% for pharmacists. At the primary healthcare level, only 55% of family medicine specialist posts were filled, as well as 40% of doctors and 85% of nurses. Production capacity has been expanding in public and private medical schools, and the government continues to send medical students abroad on scholarships to receive their training to meet HR needs (36) . In Malaysia, a dual healthcare system has emerged, with private services for those who can afford them and public services for the rest, with quality perceived to be higher in the private than in the public sector (37) . This results in sicker and poorer patients using public services (36) . A barrier to achieving UHC will be to ensure that public sector service quality improves, and service capacity expands (especially in urban areas), to keep up with increased demand. Similar concerns have been voiced out about the emergence of a dual healthcare system in Thailand, where increased demand from the wealthy urban Thai population and to a lesser extent medical tourists for private health services may drive public health workers to the private sector (38) .",22.793471066175613,9.318985060658603

The medical tourism industry in Asia is being catalyzed by the Medical Tourism Association (MTA), a US based non-profit organization that is aiming to set global standards for this industry. Health services tourism has become a substantial industry in Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia, combining health services for wealthy foreigners with recreational packages to boost consumption of such healthcare services (41) . However, each country has adopted different approaches toward medical tourism. In Malaysia, it is an explicit MOH policy to expand high-end private hospital care to cater to medical tourists (36) with the Malaysian Healthcare Travel Council established in 2009 as a promotional arm and subsidiary of the ministry. Of the 35 participating hospitals in 2010, some are corporatized public entities (e.g. National Heart Institute). Doctors in public hospitals with private wards can retain part of the fee for treating private patients, as they can in Singapore's corporatized public system.

In these countries, some to a greater extent than others, many policies and strategies have been established and implemented to facilitate progress toward UHC. For example, in Thailand, since 2002, the political commitment to universal access to healthcare was emphasized in the National Health Security Act that states that 'Thai population shall be entitled to a health service with such standards and efficiency'. In Indonesia, in 2004, the Presidential Bill No. 40/2004 on National Social Security System to protect Indonesian citizens from catastrophic household expenditure due to illness and death was enacted. In Cambodia, in 2005, a Master Plan for SHI was adopted, signifying an essential first step toward establishing a unified health protection system. In Vietnam, in 2012, the Prime Minister approved the Master Plan on UHC with a roadmap to achieve universal health insurance (UHI) coverage levels of 70% by 2015 and 80% by 2020, and to reduce OOP payment to 40% by 2020. In Myanmar, in 2012, the Government has endorsed the goal of achieving UHC by 2030 with aims to improve the health status of the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children. In the Philippines, in 2013, the president amended the National Health Insurance Act of 1995 by signing Republic Act 10606 which mandates the government to shoulder the premiums for the insurance of the indigent and informal sectors thus benefiting many Filipinos. Singapore recently announced the expansion of MediShield, a health insurance scheme designed to avert catastrophic OOP expendi-ture, which currently covers 93% of the population. The expanded program would be named MediShield Life. It will be mandatory with 100% population coverage and a stated aim of reducing co-insurance levels from the current 10√Å20% to 3√Å10% (9) . In Malaysia, the shape of UHC continues to be debated, with discussions currently centered on whether the country should transition to a SHI model, 1Care, which would allow the insured to access private facilities. Civil society and trade unions have expressed concerns that 1Care will subsidize private providers at the expense of the public, and discussions have since stalled (10, 11) .

Improved stakeholder engagement with the MOH should be able to address this challenge in the long run. Funding also has some challenges: although PHFP is currently funded by the USA Government, for full integration and institutionalization within the Uganda MoH system there must be domestic resource allocation to support this program.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first evaluation of this scale which addressed the switching profiles of antihypertensive agents among Chinese patients in real clinical practice. However, there are limitations which should be mentioned. We do not know from our data the actual reasons why patients were switched. Changing clinics, patient-initiated requests for a different drug following pharmaceutical company promotional campaigns and marketing strategies targeted towards front-line physicians [16] may also play a role in antihypertensive drug switching in addition to the occurrence of adverse effects after initiation. Furthermore, some might argue that the availability of new medications in the classes of medications in the study period, physician bias on selection of prescriptions, the implementation of local guidelines, and inefficacy of the initial prescription might, and the presence of certain comorbidities like diabetes, renal diseases and other cardiovascular conditions also explain medication switching behaviors. Critics might also argue that in different clinics under the present study, the procedures and standard practice of measuring blood pressure might differ from each other. In addition, information on socioeconomic status is not usually available in large dataset studies, although this study consists of district of residence and receipt of public allowance as two proxy measures. Furthermore, this analysis also excluded a significant number of patients who visited the clinic only once, patients who died within 180 days after the initial prescription, stayed in the cohort for less than 180 days, or prescribed more than one antihypertensive agent. This might underestimate the real switching rate as they might be at higher risk of switching. Also, hypertensive patients in Hong Kong sometimes attend both the private and public sectors for antihypertensive medication refills, although more than 90% of hypertensive patients attended the public sector for management of hypertension. If switching occurred in the private sector this information would not be captured in the database used in this study, but all our research shows that older patients are unlikely to switch from public to private sectors for care of their non communicable diseases [41] .",19.710110826198278,9.692405989782419

On a broad scale, far-reaching impacts of pandemics parallel other disasters. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa demonstrated the serious, and unanticipated, economic toll of an emerging infectious disease. From 2013 to 2014, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in Liberia decreased from 8.7% to 0.7%, due to Ebola and lowering commodity prices, and GDP growth in Sierra Leone (excluding iron ore) decreased from 5.3% to 0.8% [2] . GDP growth in Guinea in 2015, predicted at 4%, fell to 0.1%. In all three countries, government revenues declined across the board, including direct taxes on companies, VAT receipts, and indirect taxes; Additionally, decline in private and foreign investors' confidence led to financing gaps of more than US $600 million over the two years [2] . These impacts cut across many sectors and undoubtedly have long-term consequences, including implications for insurers and reinsurers (e.g., health, life), as well as overall business continuity from lack of worker capacity during illness [3] , and markets are emerging to insure against pandemic risk (such as the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, a parametric insurance vehicle designed to provide rapid disbursement of emergency finance [4] ).

Risk reduction guidelines for specific industries, whether taken up voluntarily or built into donor or private financing mechanisms, may also help with longer-term disease prevention or management; for example, audit and planning tools targeted at reducing risk of emerging infectious diseases have been developed for extractive industries [49] .The value of risk reduction aligns with the recent inclusion of 'Disease X' on the WHO's R&D Blueprint, acknowledging that the next epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown or unexpected.

More recently, and pressured by the need of more sensitive and specific detection tools for biomedical applications, in particular diagnosis, new types of protein-only biosensors are being explored [3] , that contain both the receptor and transducer elements in a single polypeptide chain. Alternatively, protein-only sensors can specifically act as receptors that exploit the whole living cell where they are synthesised, as a complex signal transducer, enabling the detection of the analyte through intricate global activities such as differential growth or support of viral multiplication among others.

First, chemical coupling to the signal transducer is not required as straightforward bioproduction results in a ready-to-use final product, either a purified protein of protein-producing cells or cell extracts.

The combination of these two techniques allows the identification of molecules with identical composition, that differ only in the very precise geometry by which they are linked together. Specialized glycan-HPLC-chips are available to separate glycans at the isomer structural level. A glycan-HPLC-chip is composed of an enrichment column and a separation column packed with porous graphitized carbon that provides the stationary phase with affinity mechanisms that lead to the isomeric separation. The enrichment column accomplishes a refined miniaturized purification of a sample by trapping only the molecules of interest, and the separation column separates molecules based on their interaction with the stationary phase. A pump moves the sample solution with the liquid mobile phase in the graphitized carbon column that binds the N-glycans. Based on the strength of their partitioning between the mobile and the stationary phases, N-glycans are eluted at different times with different mobile phase (solvent) concentrations, allowing for their separation before detection. The nanospray tip produces a spray of protonated ions for MS analysis. New HPLC instruments, including nano-HPLC, have high sensitivity and reproducibility, and use only a small amount of sample (1-2 ¬µL).",17.94070513721875,6.814713755118847

Efforts have been incorporated in the principles of the tripartite initiative among intergovernmental organizations, with the FAO, WHO, and OIE to jointly pursue the One Health approach, working in close collaboration with research institutions, academia, intergovernmental organizations, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, civil societies, and other stakeholders. An adequate surveillance system, including a strong laboratory network, is a key component of any meaningful prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. In order to develop an effective One Health implementation plan for strengthening capacity at national, regional, or global levels, there needs to be reexamination of how existing systems are structured, resourced, and managed. Such analyses will enable the development and sustainability of synergies among the human health, animal health, and ecosystem sectors [21] . Many of the studies presented at the ICOPHAI session on capacity building and One Health metaleadership were related to risk management and surveillance systems with specific insights and recommendations for operationalizing One Health. Inherent to overall surveillance is improved practice applying environmental monitoring methods to better characterize sources and profiles of environmental contaminants and pathways (i.e., air, food, and water) and modes (i.e., inhalation and ingestion) of both human and animal exposures to pathogenic agents.

Multi-disciplinary collaboration to address key challenges in this area were supported by the joint Department of Homeland Security/NIH Fogarty International Center 'Research and Policy for Infection Disease Dynamics' but the program is no longer active. In the future, MDM development efforts will need to be looked at for return on investment (ROI) metrics. Research in the agriculture sector has historically been government-funded, so the systems are not well set up for business-level analysis of their programs. However, public and private partnerships have always been important to the Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) and the USDA, Agricultural Research Service at Plum Island (USDA-ARS). The licensing of a new FMD vaccine in 2012 resulted from a successful public-private partnership including DHS S&T, USDA-ARS, and multiple industry partners. Other products are also in development via Cooperative Research and Development Agreements. Since we cannot vaccinate for something that we do not know is coming there is a need to develop therapies quickly (e.g., immunotherapeutic) to respond to disease 'X', as listed on the 2018 WHO Blueprint of Priority Diseases list [19] . If it is necessary to bring in private investors, then they will demand metrics so that ROI analysis is possible. Rabies is an example of a success story where the ROI was high due to the commercial demand for rabies treatments and both animal and human vaccines. The involvement of public or private investment for philanthropic reasons is one area where funding is currently increasing for diseases where the ROI may be sub-optimal. For example, the Pirbright Institute, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust all fund research initiatives in this area. Although philanthropic organizations are donating money they still require data that enable measurement of the success of specific initiatives (e.g., disease reduction, child health improvement). It is also important to keep the laboratory facilities side in mind. There is currently a 2-year wait for an Ebola vaccine efficacy study in the non-human primate (NHP) model. Large livestock animal (BSL-4-Ag) facilities may also have the capability to run NHP studies and could perhaps be used for this purpose. As illustrated with the development of the Hendra vaccine, the existing large animal BSL-4 facilities provide infrastructure and specialized comparative medicine and animal model expertise that could be effectively leveraged to develop and validate alternative animal models (e.g., ferret or swine) that could hasten development and regulatory approval for medical countermeasures against high-consequence pathogens. Operating and maintaining a BSL-4 agricultural facility with 24-7 capability to perform comparative animal and vaccine efficacy studies is expensive and requires a consistent and highly-trained workforce. Increasing the opportunities to make these facilities available to additional One Health partners could be an option to increase cost-effectiveness in operations and global utilization of this limited and highly specialized resource. A good example of this is the BSL4ZNet initiative that is designed to increase collaboration between high containment laboratory experts [20] . BSL4ZNet is funded by the Canadian Safety and Security Program and members include the international BSL-3-Ag and BSL-4 facilities listed in Figure 1 (NCFAD, AAHL, FLI, PI and PIADC). One major aim of this initiative is to enable knowledge sharing by producing a catalog of BSL-4 training opportunities, organizing a laboratory exchange program, and hosting presentations by subject matter experts.",15.812256870948032,7.513284792899056

Such a shift would be likely to result in higher acuity patients being seen, resulting in more time spent on patient care per patient seen and a longer stay in the ED prior to a decision on admission or discharge. Length of stay also appeared to be generally much shorter in private EDs than public ones.

These viruses have been emerging in many locations throughout the tropics and subtropics. Like many plant viruses, they are often not recognized by plant diagnostic clinics due in large part to the lack of rapid and cost effective assays. An isothermal amplification assay, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), was evaluated for its ability to detect three begomoviruses and for its suitability for use in plant diagnostic clinics. Methods for DNA extraction and separation of amplicons from proteins used in the assay were modified and compared to RPA manufacturer's protocols. The modified RPA assays were compared to PCR assays for sensitivity, use in downstream applications, cost, and speed. Results: Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays for the detection of Bean golden yellow mosaic virus, Tomato mottle virus and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) were specific, only amplifying the target viruses in three different host species. RPA was able to detect the target virus when the template was in a crude extract generated using a simple inexpensive extraction method, while PCR was not. Separation of RPA-generated amplicons from DNA-binding proteins could be accomplished by several methods, all of which were faster and less expensive than that recommended by the manufacturer. Use of these modifications resulted in an RPA assay that was faster than PCR but with a similar reagent cost. This modified RPA was the more cost effective assay when labor is added to the cost since RPA can be performed much faster than PCR. RPA had a sensitivity approximate to that of ELISA when crude extract was used as template. RPA-generated amplicons could be used in downstream applications (TA cloning, digestion with a restriction endonuclease, direct sequencing) similar to PCR but unlike some other isothermal reactions.",16.080331292629495,7.1505830560208254

First, the interference of compound fluorescence may occur when screening antivirals using fluorescent reporter-expressing viruses. Second, the antiviral effects of screened out antivirals by RCREVs need to be verified with the parental viruses. Furthermore, the antiviral effects may be different between RCREVs and the wild-type viruses due to the occasionally inclusive fluorescence signals for the wild-type viruses in indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and higher sensitivity for RCREVs in Fluc/Rluc activity assay. Third, RCREVs are not ideal tools for screening of antivirals targeting specific step(s) of viral infection, since RCREVs can undergo a complete virus life cycle. For example, currently, a set of ISGs against hepatitis C virus (HCV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) have been documented, but their exact antiviral step(s) remain(s) unknown [35] [36] [37] [38] . A practical challenge lies in the explanations of their antiviral mechanisms for antiviral ISGs screened by RCREVs. Despite these limitations, the following strategies may address some of the above issues. Fluc, Rluc and other bioluminescent reporters provide a viable alternative to fluorescent reporters in HTS assays for drug discovery [39] . This facilitates the development of highly sensitive, cell-based reporter assays [40] , eliminates the problem of compound fluorescence [41] , and possesses several advantages such as high reliability, convenience and adaptability to HTS assays. Remarkably, primary HTS followed by validation using traditional assays based on the parental viruses will greatly aid the discovery of novel antivirals against infectious diseases.

An electronic medical record database was used to identify patients with diabetes, and we cannot exclude the possibility of incomplete capture. The data source included patients who attended only public healthcare facilities, and those receiving care in the private sector-who represent about 10% of the entire disease population-were not included. As such, the incidence rates as reported were likely underestimations of the actual figure by up to 10%. However, except for 2004, there was no evidence that the ratio of medical care in private sector versus public sector has changed over time, and therefore, this is unlikely to affect assessment of incidence trends. Two-hour plasma glucose by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was not included as one of the qualifying criteria for diabetes, which could also underestimate incidence rates, especially in the paediatric population in whom HbA1c alone has low sensitivity of diagnosing type 2 diabetes [41] . The categorisation of type 1 and type 2 diabetes was based on an algorithm rather than direct inspection of the clinical notes. Although the algorithm was developed in an independent data set in which the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was verified by reviewing medical records, the absence of confirmatory tests such as anti-islet cell antibodies or C-peptide levels could lead to incorrect differentiation of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, affecting the accuracy of the algorithm. Misclassifying type 2 as type 1 diabetes would significantly inflate the incidence of type 1 diabetes, whereas the impact on incidence of type 2 diabetes was probably minimal. The probability of incorrect grouping would be greater in older patients in whom the algorithm performed less well, and estimates of incidence of type 1 diabetes in adults will require confirmation in other cohorts. Because of limitations in details of the extracted information, we could not discern patients with other aetiologies of diabetes, such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young and secondary diabetes. Owing to the asymptomatic nature of diabetes, diagnosis is often delayed. Despite the good quality of the surveillance database, undiagnosed cases could not be captured, leading to underreporting of case burden. The recorded incidence rates were also sensitive to secular changes in people's health-seeking behaviour, screening practice, and prescription behaviour.",22.197974326150067,8.612595375555511

The recent ZIKV outbreak reasserts the importance of preparedness for new viruses. While we have a whole array of impressive molecular biology technologies at our disposal, our ability to quickly identify and test molecules that might possess antiviral activity is severely hampered by lack of appropriate in vitro assays in place for Zika. We are starting from scratch even though we have known of this virus for over 60 years. This will be an important test of our ability to organize and ramp up efforts that should have been triggered by the Ebola outbreak. However, there should be a warning from that experience, as the big pharmaceutical companies played no role, and it was left to biotechs to field their highly experimental approaches. So for all of the merging of pharmaceutical companies in the last decade, we are possibly weaker for it. Clearly, they too are not willing to pursue a costly antiviral approach, unless there is a substantial financial incentive, and the priority review voucher may fit the bill. And for all the US government's efforts at being prepared with organizations like the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), who have invested billions of dollars in vaccine readiness for influenza and emerging threats, we are clearly not ready yet. We have herein proposed several approaches that could be actionable now with a bare minimum of resources and funding. It may be the case that we already have FDA and EU approved drugs that while showing activity against other viruses may have a role to play in further testing for efficacy against Zika. While we could develop incredibly sophisticated in vitro models for the ZIKV, all that may be needed is a simple readout as to whether a compound has antiviral activity or not. It should certainly not be forgotten that single agent therapies can be overcome quickly by drug resistance, and so from the very beginning, we may want to consider combination therapies like those used in HIV 70 . We can learn from antiviral drug discovery in the past and try not to repeat the same failures again.

This division often results in DVOs being one step removed from livestock keepers and reliant on PAHSPs for information on any disease outbreak events.

There is clear economic sense for governments in doing so-the average annualized economic loss from pandemics is estimated at 60 billion USD [20] . As an example, the 2003 SARS outbreak that resulted in 800 deaths cost an estimated 54 billion USD, primarily carried by the public sector [21] . However, pre-clinical drug development for rare and poverty related diseases is characterized by market failures with private sector research and development (R&D) priorities being based on profit prospects from patent monopolies and large margins rather than health needs [22, 23] . While useful for rewarding companies for developing medicines for wealthy health systems and markets, these incentive mechanisms are ineffective when there is a low-profit prospect (either small patient numbers or low purchasing power of the affected population) or an unpredictable market (such as in the case of an epidemic). Unfortunately, increasingly seen as a tool to promote economic growth, public R&D funding for pharmaceuticals has followed private sector priorities and is made contingent to partnerships with the industry, and disproportionately targets issues relevant to high income countries [23] . However, given the high cost of not being able to control an outbreak in a timely way, there is a case to be made for increased public investment to secure a robust pre-clinical candidates pipeline, ready to be tested in patients in case of an outbreak. Aimed at remediating the failure of the current R&D model to prioritize health needs and deliver affordable products, a variety of reports have been released that suggest ways to strengthen global financing for R&D for neglected and epidemic diseases and ensure affordable access [21] [22] [23] . A recurrent suggestion is to better lever the existing public sector funding already spent on drug development, in particular by ensuring that the resulting products are affordable and accessible [22] . For example, during the 2014 financial year, it is estimated that 90% (64 million USD) of EVD drug research funding was provided by the public sector [19], but it is unclear to what extent product accessibility and affordability were negotiated as a condition of this funding. There is also general agreement that alternative incentive mechanisms are required to replace drug patenting, but there is less consensus on which mechanisms to promote.

In brief, however, these instruments attempt to replicate the biological olfactory system and rely on an array of commercially available gas sensors, with overlapping sensitivities so that they are able to analyze a sample as whole. These instruments can be made smaller, are cheaper than GCMS, use air as the carrier gas and require minimal training to use. Though they have shown promise, many instruments either do not have the required sensitivity nor the repeatability required in a clinical setting (10) . A recent development to solve these issues is the gas-capillary column ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS). In these instruments, the GC component undertakes some separation of the complex chemical mixture and the IMS detects these separated chemicals with ultra-high sensitivity (down to parts per trillion) [14] .

In the assay development phase, this tool is especially useful in identifying conditions that will ensure a healthy cell layer or identify issues such as plate corner or edge effects for assay quality control. One drawback is that not the whole well is imaged, but only a certain number of fields inside the well. It is important to pick the fields wisely to avoid bias or skewing of data. Scanning at least 8 fields per well is recommended for statistical purposes, but that will increase reading time per plate. The time to read and analyze the HCI data can take considerably longer than the data acquired with the regular plate reader. HCI measures different parameters such as percentage of EBOV-positive cells and mean signal intensity per cell.

These challenges present examples where governance structures will need to weigh up the balance between regulation and persuasion as policy approaches. In the Singaporean context, differential policies in the public and private human healthcare sectors, whether by design or practice, are likely to be counterproductive, as patients use both sectors and the occurrence of resistant infections in one sector has implications for the other. On the other hand, the agricultural sector in Singapore is small and the availability of adequate veterinary expertise limited; imposing tight regulations on antibiotic access in the absence of qualified prescribers is therefore challenging, and persuasive strategies to reduce antibiotic use in this sector are likely to be more realistic, at least in the short term. On their collaborative approach towards governance, many participants highlighted the One Health platform as a good way of bringing stakeholders together. The good relationship between researchers and policymakers was also emphasized via the many avenues for researchers to discuss and share their research findings and discuss policy implications with policymakers. However, there were also conflicts reported specifically between human and animal health experts. This was crystalized on their different takes on what contributes more to AMR. Most physicians believed that antimicrobial use in animal farming as growth promoters might be a more significant driver of AMR, as has been explained by studies [28] . In contrast, animal health experts believed the animal food industry did not contribute much to the growing resistance when compared to AMR infection rates in the health sector. Finally, governing AMR through the engagement of citizens and civil society was not reported as a strategy in Singapore. However, this is not unique to Singapore, as it is well recognized that globally there has been a lack of engagement of civil society organizations in addressing AMR, especially when comparing and contrasting to the high HIV involvement in the early 90s.",18.408991562702035,8.068293108127733

On a broad scale, far-reaching impacts of pandemics parallel other disasters. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa demonstrated the serious, and unanticipated, economic toll of an emerging infectious disease.

GDP growth in Guinea in 2015, predicted at 4%, fell to 0.1%. In all three countries, government revenues declined across the board, including direct taxes on companies, VAT receipts, and indirect taxes; Additionally, decline in private and foreign investors' confidence led to financing gaps of more than US $600 million over the two years [2] . These impacts cut across many sectors and undoubtedly have long-term consequences, including implications for insurers and reinsurers (e.g., health, life), as well as overall business continuity from lack of worker capacity during illness [3] , and markets are emerging to insure against pandemic risk (such as the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, a parametric insurance vehicle designed to provide rapid disbursement of emergency finance [4] ).

Briefly, we collated individual case-based data from all laboratories offering pH1N1 testing throughout South Africa, which included patient age, sex, dates of illness onset and specimen collection, and the administrative location (province) of the healthcare facility where the patient presented. Testing was performed by accredited laboratories, including: the National Influenza Centre (NICD-NHLS), NHLS public-sector laboratories or private-sector laboratories.

A clear benefit is that, since much of the optimisation and validation is carried out in multiplex, there is relatively little additional work required to develop assays that screen for more than one pathogen; moreover, multiplex reactions increase the amount of data gained from a single sample, and incorporating an endogenous IC into the design provides confidence in the reliability of the (negative) results and allows comparison of results across laboratories. Therefore, any disadvantage of additional initial investment into assay development is quickly outweighed by the greater quantity and quality of data produced. Overall, the new assays identified similar findings to the previously published methods. Our SQPV assays and the Atkin et al. (2010) SYBR¬Æ green assay both identified SQPVas a localised infection in grey squirrels, compared with the generalised, systemic infection in red squirrels. The agreement between available TEM data and our qPCR assays for SADV was moderate (k value = 0.39), but this level of agreement is nonetheless superior to that reported in studies using conventional PCR. Grey squirrel SADV results are reasonably comparable to previous studies reporting infection prevalence of spleen and blood samples as 54-57 and 0-7 % (Everest et al. 2014 ) in comparison to 33 and 50 % reported here. The difference in prevalence of SADV in blood samples may reflect the increased sensitivity of the qPCR assay developed, with the level of SADV in blood generally low, and thus potentially overlooked when screening with conventional PCR. However, differences in selection, geography and time of year may also have been responsible for or contributed to the data obtained. In red squirrels, SADV is believed to be an enteric infection although systemic effects are witnessed, with splenitis commonly reported (Martinez-Jimenez et al. 2011; Sainsbury et al. 2001) . This is supported by our data, with the gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood and spleen showing the highest intensities and prevalence of SADV infection.",18.220628870173268,8.307533691749363

The mechanisms behind establishment of resident NK cells at mucosal sites are still not well described. Chemokines most likely play a very important role in this process and mucosal associated NK cells express a vast array of chemokine receptors including, CXCR1, CCR2, CCR7, CCR5, and CX3CR1 [42] . Additional factors are important in homing of NK cells to these sites including chemerin for female reproductive tract resident cells and sphingosine-1 phosphate family member S1P5 [43] . Given the diversity of expression of these receptors on NK cells, each tissue could regulate which cells migrate to which organ. An intriguing model behind how NK cells set up residency in different tissues has been recently proposed [8, 43, 44] . This model suggests that, unlike secondary lymphoid tissues and blood, NK precursor cells migrate from the BM into the blood then migrate further to different sites in the body including mucosal tissues. Once they have migrated, organ specific environments influence their development. Likely contributors include estrus cycling hormones, inflammatory milieu such as IL-15 by somatic cells, TGF , IL-10, and the resident microbiomes. Factors from these sources could induce NK precursor differentiation to attain different levels of maturation and education. New data on tissue specific difference in NK cell differentiation and studies investigating whether NK cells can be differentiated from tissue specific precursors may support the hypothesis that NK precursor cells seed peripheral organs and that they differentiate independent of the bone marrow [27, 45] . This would allow these tissue resident NK cells to be ""educated"" to have very specific functions important at sites to which they migrate [8] .",14.026587873536325,7.839853291157177

In doing so, we illustrate how an instrumental as opposed to a normative lens differentiates the practice of diplomacy. Health issues are still emerging and under-analyzed in the nexus between governance and diplomacy. Figure 4 shows that there have been multiple negotiations on critical global health issues in the last 10 years, which were triggered by the catalytic effect of a series of health emergencies. Therefore, global health governance is still at a formative stage and health diplomacy is very much in the transitional stage of practice in dealing, negotiating, and managing emerging health issues at different levels of governance (Lee and Smith, 2011; Novotny and Kevany, 2013) . This process is constantly demonstrating that health diplomacy is more than about public health itself. Zucker (2012) wrote, Public health negotiations are often about everything but public health. As such one much bring in the expertise from other domains including, international treaty law, finance ministries, trade delegations, foreign affairs, international security, and any other areas that are linked to the issues at hand. (pp. 273-274) The pull effect in the practice of health diplomacy increasingly appears to be strong among the NGOs, networking with state and global and local actors. As stated by Low-Beer (2012), 'a major trend since 2000 has been a shift to a wider ""partnership approach"" to delivering health aid, bringing together governments, private sector, civil society, private foundations and multilaterals, sometimes shouting and sometimes kicking' (p. 23). Nevertheless, a multitude of actors also bring divergence in preferences and uncertainty in negotiation processes. Health diplomacy thus involves a multitude of inter-dependent actors, involved in poly-lateral diplomacy, and issues that create opportunities for partnership as well as conflict of interest.",26.801459640260777,9.166298677770977

Stanford Medicine [12] acknowledges that this increase, especially in the medical field, is witnessing a proportional increase due to the increase in sources of data that are not limited to hospital records. Rather, the increase is being underpinned by drawing upon a myriad and increasing number of IoT smart devices, that are projected to exponentially increase the global healthcare market to a value of more than USD $543.3 billion by 2025 [13] .

Moreover, issues such as false-positive results may arise from crosscontamination between samples or transportation delays [20] . Currently, different types of ELISAs, including indirect [19, 21] , competitive and blocking ELISA, have been widely applied to detect PEDV in large-scale blood or feces samples, but these assays are based on the use of PEDV-specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that require more support cost and exhibit low expression yields and high levels of instability [22] .",15.14696746973646,8.578912064114792

Similarly, Chan (15) argues in favour of granting legal immunity to private physicians to protect them against damage claims. Conversely, it is important to protect the vulnerable population from uncertified personnel performing beyond their capacity. According to Wang (4) , this issue manifests itself more intensely in situations of cross-national mutual aid that are regarded as reciprocal gestures of goodwill, where programmes cross boundaries and achieve their expected goals quickly.

The limited and often incomplete evidence made it difficult to be certain if dual practice is a factor of relevance in all health systems worldwide, if it is a major issue for nurse labour market participation, and its overall impact on the provision of care.

The LAMP assay relies on the design of a set of primers that generate stem looped (hairpin) structures during the early stage of DNA synthesis. The hairpin structures form because two of the primers used contain, at their 5' end, a reverse complement of a sequence that is present in the target further downstream of the initial binding site. Displacement primers help the formation of these hairpins at the ends of the DNA strands and once formed, these structures can be copied into a series of DNA fragments containing multiple units of the target sequence under isothermal conditions utilizing the displacement properties of Bst polymerase (see [3] ). Although LAMP was first described using a set of four primers, enhanced sensitivity was reported using an additional pair of loop primers [4] . As the reactions are performed at a single temperature, LAMP assays can be performed very quickly since there are no separate denaturation, annealing and extension steps, and as such, reactions do not require thermalcyclers.

The main reason for this is that these laboratories are lightly regulated compared to the CLIA standards required in the United States. Therefore, the European market for LF-based devices has been evolving slower than that of the United States. This situation may change as EU governments see centralized testing as a way to control the cost of delivering healthcare to their aging populations. Similar to all countries of the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), they have begun placing greater emphasis on the prediction and prevention of disease through more proactive diagnostics.

Even in the lateral flow format, UCP nanoparticles present interesting challenges for field deployment. Clearly, sample preparation methods, including purification, concentration, and amplification, must be adapted for environments lacking controlled laboratory conditions and should rely on as little electricity as possible. While hand-powered centrifuges 342, 343 and battery-powered mixers 115, 344 have been developed, the ideal POC assay will be optimized to preclude these additional resources. Another issue, often unaddressed, is that the lateral flow strips must be completely dry before optical measurements and analysis. This is because water also absorbs in the near-IR, decreasing excitation efficiency of the sensitizer. 345 Typically, protocols require at least 3 h of drying time after the lateral flow assay has developed, a long time-to-result for a point-of-care test. Finally, detection of UCP particles relies on optical instrumentation. Although the most sensitive of these devices are benchtop instruments, portable battery-powered devices have been developed, such as the UCP-modified version of Qiagen's ESEQuant lateral flow reader (""UCP-Quant""). 313, 314, 346 Many of the sample preparation methods described in section 3 can be applied to UCP lateral flow formats. Additionally, innovations in hand-held optical readers discussed in section 5 require only simple adaptations to detect the anti-Stokes shift of UCP particles. There are clear advantages of using UCP nanoparticles as labels in lateral flow assays, including their inherently low background interference and high analytical sensitivity. Innovations in sample preparation methods and the development of portable optical readers will allow for these advantages to be exploited in low-resource, POC settings.",16.84503172461548,7.832917327866212

Therefore, a fall in demand of goods and services is likely to bring about a fall in the supply of such goods and services. Also, the loss of consumer and business confidence would reduce the level of aggregate demand. These effects were observed as the manufacturing industry experienced supply chain disruptions as the Singaporean economy and employment market continued to weaken. Singapore was taken off the WHO's list of SARS affected countries on 31st May 2003-one of the first countries to be removed from the list. With the ""fear-factor"" managed, normal daily activities slowly resumed. SARS affected industries and sectors started to show signs of recovery towards the end of the second quarter in 2003. A more comprehensive analysis of the economic costs of SARS will need to consider the direct impact on consumer spending and indirect repercussions of the shock on trade and investment (Asian Development Bank Outlook 2003). The economic costs from a global disease, such as SARS, go beyond the immediate impacts incurred in the affected sectors of disease-inflicted countries. This is not just because the disease spreads quickly across countries through networks related to global travel, but also because any economic shocks to one country spread quickly to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalization. However, just calculating the number of cancelled tourist trips, the declines in retail trade, and some of the factors discussed earlier do not provide a complete picture of the impact of SARS. This is because there are close linkages within economies, across sectors, and across economies in both international trade and international capital flows. Thus, analyzing the tourism sector alone may not be sufficient in analyzing the overall financial impact of SARS. SARS inflicted a heavy toll on businesses and immediately impacted severely the viability of business. Businesses lost employees for long periods of time due to factors such as illness, the need to care for family members and fear of infection at work, or retrenchment. As the workforce shrunk due to absenteeism, business operations, for example supply chain, flow of goods worldwide and provision of services, were all affected both locally and internationally. In terms of retrenchment, the job prospects of employees in affected companies appeared miserable. A survey performed during the SARS period showed that the jobless rate increased more than 5.5 %, the highest for the last decade in Singapore (Ministry of Manpower, Singapore 2003) . In absolute numbers, overall employment diminished by 25,963 in the second quarter of 2003, the largest quarterly decline since the mid-1980s recession. Unlike previous retrenchment that affected mainly blue-collar labor, SARS also affected whitecollar employees too. The implementation of workplace SARS control measures added to operational and administrative costs. For example, the policy of temperature taking was implemented at workplaces in the private sector. Numerous private establishments installed thermal-scanners in their entrances from day one. However, such precautionary measures were necessary to contain the disease. This helped to restore business confidence and investment potential (a lower level of investments will lead to slower capital growth). But the reduction in an economy's capacity may linger on for a few quarters before it is restored to pre-SARS levels. The loss of productive working days from quarantine, and implementation costs incurred to monitor movements of employees contributed to the reduction in the aggregate supply front. Some of these economic effects may have worsened the public health situation if strategic planning was not in place.",17.415935848564736,6.8660104930835875

Conventional serological techniques include the virus neutralisation test, immunoperoxidase assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay and ELISA. However, these techniques are laborious and time consuming [78] [79] [80] [81] . Moreover, the indirect immunofluorescence assay and ELISA appear to cross-react with other rhabdoviruses [80] , leading to possible false-positive diagnoses. mAbs are also useful tools for detecting SVCV and studying the function of virus-specific proteins [82, 83] . Recently, a single-chain fragment variable antibody against SVCV has been developed using phage display technology and employed for rapid detection of SVCV [84] . This antibody reacts specifically with SVCV, not cross-react with other viruses. Thus, this approach provides the basis for establishing simple and cost-effective way for the development of immunological detection assays for SVCV. Various PCR-based assays have also been used to detect SVCV owing to their high sensitivity. These include reverse transcription (RT)ePCR combined with nested PCR [85] , multiplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR [86] and one-step TaqMan real-time quantitative RT-PCR [87] . These assays have clearly improved the specificity and sensitivity of detection [88] . Although PCR is generally considered impractical for routine diagnostics in the field owing to the need for specialized instruments, skilled operators and isolation of RNA extracts, a recent report described an improved RT-PCR assay that is able to accurately detect SVCV directly from fish tissues, indicating the potential application of this technology for SVCV detection in infected fish in the field [89] .

Assay design is a crucial component of translational research because it allows one to assess the impact of different interventions in search of ones that provide mechanistic insights and pave the way for improved diagnosis, therapy, or prevention. Practical considerations, such as cost, time required to perform, and complexity, are important, especially if the assay is going to be used to screen large numbers of agents (eg, when one is trying to identify monoclonal antibodies or compounds from large libraries). The endpoint must be easy to interpret, and the result with both positive and negative controls must be highly reproducible. Most importantly, despite the simplification required to achieve the aforementioned goals, the assay must be medically and biologically meaningful, by which I mean that if the agent achieves the desired effect in the assay, there is a high likelihood that it will achieve the desired biological or medical effect when administered to an intact animal or human. In my own research, I developed an assay to measure the ability of the platelet Œ±IIbŒ≤3 receptor to bind fibrinogen by coating small beads with fibrinogen and then macroscopically determining the ability of platelets to agglutinate the beads by binding to the fibrinogen. 12 This permitted us to screen many hundreds of monoclonal antibodies while searching for an antibody that could block the binding of fibrinogen to the Œ±IIbŒ≤3 receptor on platelets. 13 One of the antibodies identified with this assay (10E5) was used for the prenatal diagnosis of inherited disorders of the Œ±IIbŒ≤3 receptor 14 (Glanzmann thrombasthenia), and another (7E3) 15 was later modified in collaboration with scientists at Centocor to become the drug abciximab. 11,16 Subsequent modifications of antiplatelet this same assay have been used to both screen libraries of organic molecules to identify new compounds for potential drug development 17 and develop, in collaboration with the scientists at Accumetrics, a series of point-of-care assays to monitor antiplatelet therapy in clinical settings. 18, 19 To successfully complete a translational project, it is necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the selected intervention in one or more rigorous clinical trials. Thus, the translational scientist requires a knowledge of the steps involved in preclinical development (medicinal chemistry, toxicology, pharmacology, and manufacturing) as well as an understanding of how to design and analyze early phase human studies. In addition, the investigator must have a firm understanding of the bioethical and biostatistical principles that are required to design a pivotal study to establish safety and efficacy. Most importantly, the translational scientist needs to understand the regulatory process and, in particular, the criteria for identifying an endpoint for the study that would justify approval for human use. Intimately connected is a requirement for insight into the practical considerations at the interface between academia and the private sector, including how the study endpoint and number of subjects needed to study will affect the length of time required to complete the study and the study's cost. It also requires an appreciation of the goals of the clinical investigators who will recruit the participants and conduct the study and an understanding of both their eagerness to advance the therapy of the diseases that they treat and their concerns about deviating from current, accepted practice. In my own career, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from, and work with, outstanding scientists at Centocor and superb cardiology groups led by Dr. Chip Gold, Dr. Eric Topol, Dr. Rob Califf, Dr. Elliot Antman, and Dr. Eugene Braunwald, who provided me with an in-depth understanding of these vital issues. 11,20-23 I recognize that many academic leaders may believe that it is unreasonable to expect that an academic translational scientist or team will have all of the knowledge discussed here before embarking on a project. However, I think that the failure to have at least a conceptual understanding of the entire process can result in mistaken priority setting, inappropriate commitment of resources, and investigator frustration and dropout as predictably unrealistic expectations meet the harsh realities. Thus, formal opportunities to learn about how the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries develop drugs and devices should be incorporated into all translational training programs.",24.17934942331476,12.275706661048503

Documentation of diagnosis both in hospitals and in health centers is limited to single primary diagnosis. Information on surgical and medical procedures is never collected. The lack of documentation or in-complete collection of data deprives the researchers and decision makers of the information regarding the complexity and severity of cases managed. Furthermore, this may limit the use of information for planning, budgeting, and quality-monitoring purposes. Most of the data submitted to the central headquarters are in aggregated form. Patient-level data are not routinely collected both at the state level and at the central level. Thus, this limits the data for research and policy development.",15.581015817184642,7.608628139049598

According to a report prepared by the Institute of Ocean Development and Strategy Institute, which is under China's State Oceanic Administration, the Taiwanese move was interpreted as another practice of President Lee's ''Two States Statement''. It is also believed that the move was taken for the strategic purpose of differentiating Taiwan SCS policy from China's and was an important indicator of Taiwan's adjustment of its security strategy. It is also stated in the report that Taiwan's move in the Spratly Islands would have the potential to make the situation in the SCS more complicated and to weaken China's overall safeguarding strength in the SCS area. 39 In December 2001, the Cross-Strait SCS Issues Exchange and Co-operation Academic Dialogue Meeting was held in Tao-Yuan, Taiwan. Around 16 Taiwanese and 6 Chinese scholars and governmental officials attended the meeting. One of the major issues discussed was cross-strait co-operation on the SCS issues.

These could play a significant role in speeding patient diagnosis and, in some cases, reducing emergency room overcrowding. For biological and medical sensing applications, disease diagnosis by detecting specific biomarkers (functional or structural abnormal enzymes, low molecular weight proteins, or antigen) in blood, urine, saliva, or tissue samples has been established using a number of approaches, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), particle-based flow cytometric assays, electrochemical techniques based on impedance and capacitance, electrical measurement of micro-cantilever resonant frequency change, and conductance measurement of semiconductor nanostructures [1√Ä3] . For some of these techniques, here are some drawbacks related to assay time and throughput. ELISA allows only one analyte measurement at a time. Particle-based assays allow for multiple detections by using multiple beads, but the whole detection process is generally longer than 2 hours, which is not practical for in-office or bedside detection. Electrochemical devices are low cost, but improvements in sensitivities are still needed for clinical samples. Microcantilevers are capable of detecting concentrations as low as 10 pg/mL but suffer from an undesirable resonant frequency change due to the viscosity of the medium and cantilever damping in the solution environment. Nanomaterial devices have provided an excellent option toward fast, label-free, sensitive, selective, and multiple detections for both preclinical and clinical applications.",17.595618648918403,7.468911412613766

The Dual-use Dilemma in the Biological Sciences 557 biotechnology industry has, of course, been a key driver of the genetic sciences which have made the dual-use dilemma so prominent in recent years. While the free sharing of information and the pursuit of knowledge are central values of academic research, however, industrial research is usually primarily motivated by the pursuit of profits. This has several implications. One, as we have pointed out before, is that industrial discoveries are often kept secret rather than published or otherwise widely shared with the academic community. While this might alleviate worries about the publication of dangerous discoveries that might result from such research (and, as we indicated before, make one doubt that complete openness in the sharing of information is essential to the progress of science), it also means that there is less public awareness of the discoveries taking place-and less public scrutiny of the extent to which the relevant research is dangerous. While academic scientists presumably usually have the good of humanity as a top concern, furthermore, one might be justified to worry that private companies will sometimes be comparatively less reluctant to pursue research with the potential for malevolent use insofar as their primary concern is (by admission) the promotion of profits rather than, necessarily, the benefit of humankind. A final cause for concern, finally, is that private research is not generally subject to the same institutional oversight (via institutional ethics committees) as that which takes place in universities. We point all this out to show that research of private industry is relevant to the dual-use dilemma too-and that it raises special issues of its own. Free enterprise is an important social good; but, because society may be threatened by dangerous industrial research, it may be argued that more oversight of industrial research is warranted. For example, companies who synthesise the genes of viruses, e.g., potentially Ebola and smallpox, should be required to report any requests involving genomes of infectious organisms that could be used as weapons of mass destruction (WMD). In the western world this would be feasible. However, much of this work is now carried out in China and India where regulations to this effect would be far more difficult to impose and enforce. These points should be kept in mind in the discussion of regulation that follows.",19.384079153798098,8.180201958032177

The financial terms of the pandemic bond are complex, but, in short, large private investors (rather than nationstates) put money in up-front for 3 years. If a qualifying pandemic occurs during that time, some of the money is disbursed for pandemic response. Otherwise, the investors get their money back plus interest of 10% or more. 8 Everyone concerned with public health agrees that pre-committed pandemic funds are a good idea. However, growing uncertainty about how best to pay for health emergencies of international concern has brought previous health and humanitarian risk management strategies into question. In the past, governments and philanthropies mitigated all kinds of risks, from disease outbreaks to droughts. Since the 1970s, however, private sector involvement in civic problem-solving has increased.

Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with an overall population density of over 6350 persons/km 2 where Kwun Tong District had about 52,123 persons/km 2 (Census and Statistics Department, 2007 ) and 194,178 domestic households in 2006 (Census and Statistics Department, 2006 . Urban space is at a premium. As a result, there are always arguments in favour of and against compact urban form. Such a development model is often praised for its efficient utilization of precious urban land because a large number of residents can share the common space and facilities within mass housing estates. However, a high concentration of residents also results in a very congested environment.

In a study of outbound tourism from Korea to Australia, King and Choi (1999) noted that travel agents exerted a strong influence on destination choice by Koreans, while Oppermann (1999b) observed that although a significant component of tourism, the role of travel agents has been largely ignored in the literature. Buhalis (2000) noted that access to web travel sources was becoming an important factor in destination selection and inferred that destinations ignoring the Internet will suffer a decline in tourism.

However, if VS technologies can reduce the library size to 10's or 100's of compounds, many of these constraints are lifted allowing the use of more physiologically relevant or complex assays, potentially including whole animal-based assays, which are recognized as a viable alternative in today's search for novel pharmaceuticals. Another issue related to assay implementation is the selection of in vitro vs. in vivo assays. Many of the initial hits in enzyme/protein-based in vitro assays may fail at the cellular or animal level due to stability or metabolism issues. However, with the development of VS and post-HTS analysis methods, this can be minimized. Finally, assay selection has a strong influence on the outcome of the physical screen.

The combination of shrinking budget allocations for social services and the entry of private actors into health care resulted in a contraction of service provision (Armada et al. 2001; Oppong 2001) . While ideally private competition would create more effective, competitively priced service delivery, such a theory was based upon a notion that all markets are equally attractive. This simply did not prove to be the case. For example, in some rural areas sparse population and the low income levels meant that economies of scale for health care delivery could never be realized, and that people would not be able to pay for medical care (World Bank 2004) . These two factors alone would be enough to dissuade private health care providers from operating in the area. It would be difficult to get a single private enterprise to provide services, let alone allow for competition. 3 With the lack of private entrants in the high cost, high risk areas, provision falls to the public sector. However, with constrained fiscal and human resources, and in some cases the loss of more profitable markets to the private sector, the public sector proved not capable of providing adequate levels or types of health services (Oppong 2001; Smith-Nonini 2000; World Bank 2004) .

The Bretton-Woods institutions were created in 1944 to better manage the global economy through rebuilding the shattered economies of both the defeated and the victorious in the war, and by creating international resources and policies to further economic growth from which, in theory, prosperity and peace would follow. The Bretton-Woods institutions are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD or the World Bank) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which are distinct yet complementary organizations. The World Bank's mission was to rebuild the shattered infrastructure of Europe and Asia and provide technical and financial assistance to create the conditions of economic and political stability, growth in trade, and improvement in living standards. The IMF's role was to manage and promote international monetary cooperation and trade. Its initial focus was to provide short-term loans to nation-states for investment in capital expenses and structures deemed necessary for economic growth, and also provide countries with assistance in overcoming balance of trade problems. Such issues were initially viewed as being short-term necessities of economic growth. The role of the IMF evolved partially due to the Debt Crisis of the 1980s, the financial crises of the 1990s, and the global recession. Its role is no longer limited to monetary policy and short-term balance of payments issues. Rather, the IMF is engaged in macro-economic management of monetary and fiscal policy, longer term debt negotiation and restructuring, and global financial stability. It serves developed as well as developing countries as witnessed by the US$ 2.1 billion loan to Iceland initiated in 2008 (Anderson 2008) . Of the two Bretton-Woods institutions, the World Bank was created specifically to address global development. As the full title indicates, its initial raison d'etre was post-war reconstruction. Only after a modicum of stability was achieved in rebuilding could the World Bank focus on the project of development. Today, the World Bank is the largest public development institution in the world with annual lending totaling US$24 billion. It consists of five institutions, including the original IBRD, the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The IFC was added to the World Bank Group in 1956 to assist with and coordinate private sector investment. The IDA was created in 1960 to provide interest-free loans and technical assistance to only the poorest nations. In 1966, the ICSID was created as a forum to settle disputes arising between investors and national governments. MIGA is the most recent addition to the World Bank Group.

Also, the integration of NWs into functional devices with high yields is another important issue. The fully integration of separation and purification processes are used to control NWs properties during device fabrication. Recently, solvent-based reproducible and controllable positioning, placement and orientation of NWs on the desired substrate locations are effectively utilized. From the application point of view, the development of a simple and reliable reference electrode integration method and diagnosis under physiological conditions may lead to a new generation of devices. Additionally, fouling during bioanalytical applications in a real sample is another problem, which greatly reduces the sensitivity of the device during detection of specific targets. To overcome this issue, antifouling surface coatings are mainly used to reduce/minimize nonspecific interactions.

We investigated whether the introduction of the GB program affected prescriptions for second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) for schizophrenic outpatients in public and private medical and psychiatric centers. Methods: The prescription data of schizophrenic outpatients treated between 2001 and 2004 were retrieved from the TBNHI database, which included outpatients who were diagnosed as having schizophrenia during the period from 1996 to 2001. Because the new health insurance policy may have had a lag effect on physicians' decision regarding SGA prescription, we used January 2004 as the timepoint to divide the data, which was 6 months after GB implementation. Thus, data from the 6-month period immediately after the GB implementation were included in the pre-GB period. Second-generation antipsychotics included in the study were clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, zotepin, and amisulpride. Results: After January 2004, the proportion of SGA use in outpatient departments did not show an upward trend, as had been observed in the pre-GB period, which appeared at a staggering pace lasting for 12 months ( p ¬º 0.0004).

For example, engagement of community members who advocate for best practices, encourage health-care-seeking behaviours, and support patients through treatment can help ensure that interventions initiated by the tuberculosis programme have wide-reaching and sustained eff ect. Additionally, partnerships with other government sectors, such as those in charge of prisons or social welfare programmes, can ease access to vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations. Finally, partnerships with the private sector are necessary in settings such as south Asia, where 80% of patients seek care from private providers. 75 In view of the large number and the heterogeneity of private providers, it is an immense undertaking for national tuberculosis programmes to eff ectively engage these providers to ensure that patients with tuberculosis receive timely diagnoses and appropriate treatment, and that all tuberculosis cases are reported to the national tuberculosis programme even if they are diagnosed and treated in the private sector. Although strategies will vary across settings, some approaches that have proven successful include use of large private hospitals with associated clinic networks as reporting centres for the national tuberculosis programme; use of mobile phone-based platforms to help report screening or diagnostic results from private facilities; and mass media campaigns that give publicity to private facilities that have partnered with the national programme to off er testing and treatment. 29, 75 Projection of impact What impact would be expected from a commitment to identify and treat more people with tuberculosis than is achieved at present? Models consistent with the present tuberculosis epidemics in China, India, and South Africa predict that an increase in case detection by 25% can achieve a 40-44% reduction in tuberculosis-associated mortality, a 22-27% reduction in incidence, and a 30-33% reduction in prevalence in 10 years (fi gure). 76 Furthermore, these interventions were deemed to be highly cost eff ective, even if the costs of the interventions were as high as US$2500 per case detected in India, and $5000 per case detected in China and South Africa. Importantly, these projections show that the populationlevel benefi ts of active case-fi nding accumulate with time since removal of infectious cases from the population prevents the development of additional cases in both the near-term and long-term future; thus an assessment at the end of 1 year is unlikely to show a substantial eff ect, even though the 10 year projected benefi t is substantial. These projections assume that detection is synonymous with prompt and eff ective treatment, so all case-fi nding has to be directly linked to the immediate delivery of care.",28.349571226962528,13.77309220992013

Yet, as is the case for the technologies used to manufacture most current human vaccines, the core immunoassays used to bring viral vaccines to licensure are generally simple, as exemplified by antibody-based viral neutralization assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and multiplex binding assays. This restricted range of assay types largely reflects a need to standardize assays rigorously (Guidance for Industry. Bioanalytical Method Validation (Draft) 2013) and practical limitations on the sophistication of assays that can be used as primary endpoint in the large-scale clinical trials (often with tens of thousands of subjects) required to bring novel vaccines to licensure. More sophisticated measures of cellmediated immunity have had a prominent role in vaccine research but a much more minor role in vaccine licensure. The difficulty of standardizing such assays and assigning a threshold assay value that indicates protection has limited their use as correlates of protection for vaccine trials being used for registration. Similarly, although mucosal immunity surely plays a major role in determining vaccine-mediated protection, challenges in sample collection and assay consistency have the consequence that serum antibody levels rather than measures of mucosal immunity are favored as correlates of protection for vaccine licensure. Nevertheless, measures of cell-mediated immunity, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays and fluorescence-activated cell sorter-based T cell functional analyses, are routinely used as exploratory endpoints during vaccine development. Recently, investigators have also added systems biology approaches, with transcriptional array, mass cytometry-based cell sorting, and luminex binding assays to their analytical tool box for investigating the early innate immune responses to vaccination (O'Gorman et al., 2014; Tsang et al., 2014) . To date, none of these interesting approaches have proven sufficiently robust or predictive to be used as licensure criteria.

Consequently, ''comparing incident statistics across teams is difficult and often meaningless,'' which diminishes the value of what little information is shared. 31(p83) Proposals for the federal government to establish authoritative standards and agencies have gained little traction. In 1989, the General Accounting Office (GAO) argued that internet security required a focal point. It proposed that the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) establish this focal point, but to no avail. 30 In 1991, the National Research Council recommended that the government help establish a nongovernmental organization to serve a similar function-again, with no apparent impact. 41 CERT/CC even pitched a similar proposal in 1997, which, by implication, was a concession that the CERT/CC had failed to establish itself as the single clearinghouse for cyber intelligence. 42 In 1998, President Bill Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), 43 calling for ''A Public-Private Partnership'' to reduce the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber attack. PDD-63 encouraged the private sector to create an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), modeled on the CDC: As ultimately designed by private sector representatives, the ISAC may emulate particular aspects of such institutions as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that have proved highly effective. . 43 However, unlike the CDC (ie, a federal agency with police powers, informed by compulsory reporting at the state level), this ISAC was to be private and voluntary. Moreover, ''the single ISAC-the one PDD-63 calls for-was never built'' (interview with former US National Security Council staff, September 2015). Rather than establish a single clearinghouse, building separate ISACs became a business opportunity. 44 At least 19 sector-specific ISACs were subsequently established for financial services, energy, healthcare, and other parts of critical infrastructure. While reasonable, this outcome was not inevitable, especially since variation inside a given sector (eg, small and medium enterprises versus multinational corporations) may be just as significant for security as variation across sectors (eg, finance versus energy or healthcare).",23.160163532223038,9.96196849712134

Homogeneous assays are based on the reaction of antigen with an antibody-enzyme complex. This results in steric hindrance of the enzyme, which causes a decrease in product after reaction with enzyme substrate. The major advantage of homogeneous assays is that they do not require the separation and washing steps required in heterogeneous assays. The major disadvantage of this type of EIA is that it has been difficult to apply it to detection of high-molecularweight antigens with the degree of sensitivity required. Thus, the homogeneous assay has been used mainly for detection of hormones, drugs, and other low-molecular-weight substances. Means to improve the sensitivity of homogeneous assays have been devised (review by Yolken, 1982) but have not been widely used. Thus, the applications discussed below will be limited to EIA tests of the solid-phase type.",17.85171466924906,7.9858029181793935

It is unlikely that a battery powered aircraft engine will be developed in the near future due to issues with the weight and size of the batteries available under current technological capabilities. Consequently, aviation is likely to continue to be dependent on oil for the foreseeable future. Two types of government action may be helpful in this regard. First, it would appear to be important to begin regulating oil speculation in order to prevent oil upside spikes that caused the massive changes in the price of oil inputs mid 2008. Second, were the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan to agree, it would be possible to break the stranglehold of the OPEC cartel on current oil prices. The current price of jet fuel has little connection to the cost of production. The relevant governments could restrict oil imports if prices were deemed unacceptably high. Independently, these governments could subsidize research and development into new, cleaner technologies that would encourage universities and the private sector to explore ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Current promising avenues include the use of lithium aluminum or composite materials to reduce the weight of the aircraft and the development of alternative fuels, such as bio-fuels which reduce carbon dioxide based on the full life cycle approach.

Moreover, the greater incidences of cross contamination and overuse of drugs has contributed towards the development of drug resistant microbial strains making conditions even worse. Hospital acquired infections pose one of the leading complications associated with implantation of any biomaterial after surgery and critical care. In this regard, developing non-conventional antimicrobial agents which would prevent the aforementioned causes is under the quest. The rapid development in nanoscience and nanotechnology has shown promising potential for developing novel biocidal agents that would integrate with a biomaterial to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. Metals with inherent antimicrobial properties such as silver, copper, zinc at nano scale constitute a special class of antimicrobials which have broad spectrum antimicrobial nature and pose minimum toxicity to humans. Hence, novel biomaterials that inhibit microbial growth would be of great significance to eliminate medical device/instruments associated infections. This chapter comprises the state-of-art advancements in the development of nano-antimicrobial biomaterials for biomedical applications. Several strategies have been targeted to satisfy few important concern such as enhanced long term antimicrobial activity and stability, minimize leaching of antimicrobial material and promote reuse. The proposed strategies to develop new hybrid antimicrobial biomaterials would offer a potent antibacterial solution in healthcare sector such as wound healing applications, tissue scaffolds, medical implants, surgical devices and instruments.",18.2885983184048,7.166441447364684

IFA is recognized as the bgold stand-ardQ (Tang et al., 2004) . It uses inactivated SARS-CoV-infected cells fixed on a slide as antigen to detect SARS antibody in serum samples. It is known that conventional whole virus IFA can detect positive SARS-CoV infection using sera collected as early as 8 days. However, conventional whole virus IFA is not so convenient since it initially utilizes infectious SARS-CoV to infect cell culture before fixating on the slides. Although the inactivated IFA slides can be handled in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories, the initial infection procedure needs to be carried out in a BSL-3 research facility. This makes the whole virus IFA difficult to perform in most laboratories, as there is a risk of contamination when dealing with live virus. Due to the current problems and safety issues with the whole virus IFA, a safer serological assay with little risk of contamination is needed for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. This has led to the development of Nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA and immunoblot assays. However, until recently, little information has been available to evaluate Spike protein-based immunoassays for the detection of specific antibodies in SARS patients.",12.87352768098764,6.777617347542527

MN assays are generally more sensitive and measure a broader repertoire of functional antibodies that neutralize viral replication, with potential advantages in the evaluation of human serological responses. In addition, comparisons of MN and HAI tests for measuring antibody responses in vaccinated individuals have shown a consistent degree of correlation and have confirmed the utility of MN assays in analyses of human antibody responses to H3 vaccine components. Techniques for simplifying assay formats and making them more readily applicable to the routine testing of low-titre viruses are under investigation, and efforts are under way to use MN assays for H1 and B viruses. This should facilitate the use of MN assays to overcome the variable nature of interactions between viruses and RBCs, and hence in interpreting 'anomalous' HAI results which complicate vaccine virus selection. Pseudotype virus neutralization assays may also offer some advantages in scale and standardization over conventional MN assays for measuring serological responses to particular viruses, especially highly pathogenic viruses. Furthermore, ongoing improvements in automation will potentially enable the more labour-intensive MN assay to be applied to large-scale serological analysis. Epitope mapping using genome fragment phage display libraries provides another powerful technique for further dissecting the fine specificity of antibody responses to vaccination and infection and should allow for a better assessment of the quality of a 'protective' immune response and aid the development of additional correlates of immunity.",12.78299160338796,6.760114237050958

The globalization of the world is a reality. It is not a new concept. While nurses form the cornerstone of the healthcare teams, nurses have not taken a leadership role in global healthcare issues or in moving forward with active programs of international collaborative work and research. International collaborations in healthcare research are particularly lacking between Eastern and Western countries. Only a handful of nurse researchers have begun to take an initiative in this venue. Similarities as well as differences in healthcare issues, healthcare delivery systems, environmental, sociocultural, and economical factors, and health behaviors and health policies both at the population and individual levels, for example, can form a rich ground for mutual learning in solving common healthcare problems between the nations. Many healthcare issues are no longer an isolated problem confined to a certain nation or region of the world. As the entire world is within one-day traveling distance, a health problem in one region or nation can quickly spread to the other regions and nations in a very short time period. A recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a very good example of such healthcare crises that demand rapid and efficient solutions via active international collaborations. Beyond such unexpected and sporadic outbreaks of illnesses and diseases, a more fundamental issue is how nurses and nurse researchers should think out-ofthe-box and out of the one-locality and one-nation mind set.

In toxicology regulatory guidance documents, the TDAR is considered to be one of the functional assays of choice to evaluate potential immunotoxicity of investigational new drugs. However, the interanimal variability limits the sensitivity of the assay in studies powered for general toxicology evaluations, despite the similar behavior of sexes or animals from different countries of origin. Inhibition of the TDAR can be clearly evidenced with immunosuppressive agents in NHPs, but demonstrating a lack of activity in the assay has been problematic and the definition of biologically irrelevant variations is not established. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin, (KLH), sheep red blood cells (SRBC), and tetanus toxoid (TT) are the most commonly used antigens for challenge; KLH and TT show similar interanimal variability and a trend to less variability than SRBC.

Even though globally many countries are grappling with common problems, such as increased health needs and demands for healthcare, alongside the rising costs of providing it, there is not one, simple international line of convergence towards a common form of health system. The reason is that health systems are shaped significantly by their centuries-old economic and political regimes. In addi-tion, they take their form from 'national logics', that is, how a society defines and deals with issues of health and illness. Equally, cultural factors influence how populations respond to proposed changes to their health system as well as how those external to a country relate to it. Even so, without undue risk of overgeneralisation, we can point towards a worldwide drive towards the commercialisation of health systems and, where public provision exists, such as in our case example of the UK, to the rollback of state or public provision in favour of the free market principles. Thus, most health systems around the world have or are moving towards a mix of public/private provision. With this point in mind, it has been argued that health services are now as much about investor potential as access to care for patients. Tritter and colleagues maintain that Health systems are no longer important primarily because they ensure that people gain access to health services when in need and irrespective of their ability to pay, that epidemics are prevented or controlled [...] or that the social determinants of health are addressed as part of public policies. In the emerging context of the reform policies, health systems are important not only as providers of products and services for which people are willing to pay, but also as an investment opportunity within global financial markets. (Tritter et al. 2010: 36) Although they manifest in different ways across health systems, we can point to a set of three shared global influences: neoliberalism (see also the discussions on neoliberalism in Chaps. 4 and 6) as the dominant politico-economic policy framework driving system change; macroeconomic policies and structural adjustment programmes (SAPs); and international trade agreements.",18.29983316969946,8.457926443112157

Among other things, the NEM proposed to quicken economic transformation from low valueadded sectors supported by unskilled cheap labour to high valueadded sectors with innovative productivity-enhancement capabilities. The NEM even considered introducing unemployment insurance and a minimum wage system. Fierce opposition to these proposals was quickly raised by private sector organisations such as Malaysian Employers' Federation, Small and Medium Industry Associations of Malaysia, Malaysian Agricultural Producers Association, and the Malaysian International Chambers of Commerce and Industry. In response, the government shelved the idea of unemployment insurance. Only because the ruling coalition faced a serious electoral challenge from the opposition (the original source of the minimum wage proposal), Najib announced in April 2012 that private sector firms must guarantee a minimum wage (determined by the government) for their employees, including foreign migrant workers. Pressed by the private sector once more, the government again retreated, permitting a non-implementation 'grace period' (of up to one year) and allowing firms employing foreign workers to be exempted from certain levies. In other words, the NEM's aim to discourage the use of cheap foreign workers was largely undone (Suzuki 2014: 152-61) .",35.13208357054796,13.557045451259436

These countries now find it more difficult to privilege firms located within their borders to foster national economic development. However, a more competitive global economy does not make the failure of developing economies inevitable. For instance, Aseema Sinha (2016) vividly analyses how the pressure of trade liberalisation under the WTO served to revitalise Indian pharmaceutical and textile industries. In both cases, the private sector in India was highly resistant to liberalisation, but WTO obligations strengthened the influence of reformers in the state and forced the private sector to change its preference. Entering the twenty-first century, the Indian pharmaceutical industry strategically turned to specialising in the production and marketing of generic medicines and boosted its investment in product development. Likewise, to prepare for the abolition of the multi-fibre agreement expected in 2005, India's textile industry changed its strategy drastically from sheltering under state protection to seeking export promotion and international competitiveness. To this end, firms in the industry increased R&D expenditure and extended backward and forward linkages. The two industries are now highly successful.

Indeed, such tensions exist simply within the concept of sustainability itself as it embraces the often-conflicting goals of environmental protection, long-term economic development, and social inclusion. To summarise, even before the crisis of 2001 and its aftermath, policies and strategies that might have curbed or diminished the environmental externalities of air transport were likely to have been swamped by those promoting its development. While air transport is almost entirely a derived demand, one result of liberalization and privatization is that its provision is now dominated by the interests of private or quasi-private sector airline and airport companies. Although the latter may be constrained in that they have to interact much more directly through the planning processes than do airlines with other public concerns and demands, the marketing strategies of both airlines and airports may impact directly and negatively on the attainment of sustainability objectives. These tactics strive to achieve precisely the opposite effect to the demand management of mobility implied in the concept of sustainability.

Even in upper middle-income countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, many firms have made no effort to wean themselves off the dependence on cheap labour. Although some of that labour is domestic in origin, Malaysia (Chapter 5, this volume) and Thailand (Chapter 2, this volume) have seen an influx of unskilled and often undocumented migrant workers from neighbouring low-income countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, and Myanmar. For Malaysia, a chronic and massive dependence on low-skilled, lowwage foreign labour only pushes the economy towards premature deindustrialisation and obstructs more innovative and higher value-added economic activities (Chapter 5, this volume). Likewise, in Thailand almost two million migrants from neighbouring low-income countries were mostly unskilled workers employed in sectors such as construction, low-skill services, agriculture, fishery, food processing, and garments (Chapter 2, this volume; Yamada 2014: 142-3).

Thailand and Malaysia have shown a strong preference for this strategy. However, the time when an industry could replace another by the logic of product cycles (Vernon 1966) has long gone. Owing to the rapid development of communication and transportation technologies as well as the spread of modular product architecture, the production process in an industry can now be fragmented into many segments and located in different parts of the world (Yeung 2016: 1, 5) . Logistics and marketing can also be distributed to different parts of the world. Locational decisions of foreign lead firms largely depend on the availability of local human, technological, and institutional resources. For Coe and Yeung (2015: 173) , however, technological downgrading (not upgrading) may sometimes bring comparative advantage to certain localities because it matches production for lowerincome markets. However, to sustain economic growth, a middle-income country must obtain higher technology portions of global production networks located in its territory. This will require the technological upgrading of local suppliers and labour force, a task that has not been easy for Thailand and Malaysia. Upgrading in Thailand has been undertaken in many sectors, including the hard disc drive (HDD) sub-sector of the electronics industry, the automobile industry, and the food processing industry (Chapter 6, this volume). However, since the electronics and automobile sectors are dominated by MNCs (Chapter 2, this volume), the successful transplantation of high value-added processes to Thailand has required special efforts by the state and the private sector. Intarakumnerd (Chapter 6, this volume) describes in detail how sector-specific intermediaries have striven to link firms to each other and to related agencies to improve productivity and competitiveness. The Hard Disc Drive Institute (HDDI) is a good example of how such collaboration was accomplished. The HDDI, consisting of government agencies, MNCs, and local research institutes (universities), set up university-industry linkages, testing laboratories, joint training programs, and collaborative R&D projects. This contributed to upgrading the technological capability of the whole HDD cluster. The Thailand Automotive Institute (TAI) is HDDI's counterpart in the automobile industry although its function is general rather than to serve specific sub-sectors and its impacts are yet to be seen.",17.38084435473977,7.681021213570083

In 2008, private per-head health-related expenditures were triple that of public per-head expenditure. 16 In view of the fact that people covered by private health plans are healthier, richer, and younger than are those not covered, substantial inequalities exist between private and public systems. In 2010, the Brazilian private health market was estimated to be about US$36 billion-only slightly less than the $38 billion spent by all Brazilian states and municipalities. 16 Since the establishment of SUS, access to health care has increased, and use has become more equitable across regions and income groups. Out-of-pocket payment patterns vary across income groups. Among the poorest group, direct expenditures are spent mainly on purchasing of medicine. The richest group spends proportionally less on diagnostic tests, but is the heaviest consumers of these procedures. 17 Unable to aff ord private health plans, and paying proportionally higher out-of-pocket rates (19%), access is most diffi cult for the lower middle-class.

The aim of this study was to review susceptibility data of isolates from adult patients presenting with bacteremic pneumococcal communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), comparing cases in the public and private sectors in Gauteng, South Africa. Methods: We wished to recruit 100 consecutive adult patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia and CAP. Patients without radiographic evidence of pneumonia, or with other clinical diagnoses (e.g. meningitis) were excluded. Repeat isolates were excluded. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done according to CLSI guidelines, using disc screening and MIC determination with agar dilution and E-tests. Results: 149 cases were recruited, 97 in the public and 52 in the private sector. Public sector patients were younger (median age 33 years vs. 45 years; p < 0.001), with more HIV infection and less co-morbid illness. Cases in the private sector were more likely to have received antibiotics in the past 3 months. The overall rate of antimicrobial resistance was considerably lower than reported previously in South Africa. Resistance to penicillin was 16% in the public and 23% in the private sector (not significantly different). There were also no significant differences in the susceptibility of the isolates to ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, rifampicin or ofloxacin. However significantly more resistance was seen in the private sector isolates to erythromycin (28% vs. 4%; P < 0.001) and clindamycin (21% vs. 3%; p = 0.001). Conclusion: A number of clinical differences were seen in public vs. private sector patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia in Gauteng, South Africa.

This places undue pressure on inadequately funded public health systems, where cost recovery for accident and emergency treatment is not a common occurrence. Whilst Bentley et al. (2001) observed that many injuries are minor, largely in the slips, trips and falls category, and they do pose problems for health systems. The interaction between Health Education Weston (1996) the public sector tourism and health systems is weakly developed, and it offers considerable scope for developing Best Practice models to reduce tourist injuries, accidents and morbidity. Here, the role of travel medicine has a role to play in risk assessment and prevention at the pre-travel phase but also a greater reinforcement in the destination area. Where voluntary cooperation and safety management is not practical or feasible, then legislation by government agencies is required, in areas such as food hygiene and handling where international standards exist. Yet we cannot manage risk out of tourism. If we do, as Page, Bentley, and Walker (2005) noted, then tourist experiences will cease to be fun, exciting, different and could become artificial and too stage-managed. That is certainly not in the interest of the tourism industry, which is in the business of fulfilling dreams, desires and ambitions. The challenge is to balance the need for the provision of an exciting or meaningful experience with a realistic assessment of the risks involved to tourist health, so that visitor well-being is safeguarded where practicable but not to the point of wrapping participants in cotton wool. Much of what the international tourism industry provides is of a standard where risk factors are known to the operators, but only slowly is that being made more transparent to visitors. To provide a full outline of all known risks and likely injuries would detract from the experience of a holiday. Therefore, balancing what the tourist needs to be told versus what is actually disclosed is now a contentious but burgeoning issue. Operators are increasingly being required to disclose risks to travellers in brochures and on web sites so insurance risks can be calculated and cover provided. The tourism sector does not operate as a seamless business, despite the role of large multinational integrated operators, and travel medicine issues highlight many of the inherent flaws in their modus operandi. Whilst the most advanced operators do track risk and injury issues via customer surveys and complaints, their approach in the main is still reactive because responsibility for tourist well-being is largely an outcome of what happens in the destination. As a result, much of this is outside of the immediate control of the tour operator, and within the remit of the destinations public and private sector tourism industry. The differing approaches of destinations to such issues also gives rise to a lack of consistency in the management of tourist health and safety, since human behaviour changes on holiday and the public sector have varying approaches and attitudes to how such behaviour should be managed.",24.627396732994097,11.2474369512497

First, all researchers (public and private sector) have access to the screening centers through the NIH X01 and R03 funding mechanisms [6] . Second, due to the diverse source of assays and the wide expertise available within the MSLCN, specific biological systems investigated and screened will include: (a) ''high risk'' targets, that is proteins or biological systems whose function is unknown; (b) targets implicated in orphan diseases or diseases not typically addressed by the private sector; (c) novel or uncommon assay systems (e.g., zebrafish, high content screening); and (d) ''non-druggable'' targets, such as inhibitors of aggregation and protein-protein interactions. Third, the small molecule screening library contains structures not typically found in commercial collections or those housed in pharmaceutical companies. Sources of these unique structures include natural products and novel compound libraries prepared by academic investigators through the Pilot Scale Libraries (PSL) granting mechanisms [7] , compounds generated by the Centers for Chemical Methodologies and Library Development (CMLD) (vida infra) [8] and those obtained through solicitation by the NIH [9] . Fourth, as the goal of the MLSCN is to develop selective chemical probes and small molecule tools that will interrogate novel biochemical pathways, the criteria for an acceptable class of molecules is broader for the MLSCN than for those involved in drug discovery and development. Therefore, chemical probes are not subject to the same constraints on physical properties, functional groups or metabolic profiles that are common in the pharmaceutical industry, and necessary for successful clinical candidates. An example of a compound that would fit the definition of a valuable chemical probe, but which would not adhere to the commonly prescribed criteria of ''drug-like'' is a staurosporinederived ruthenium complex, shown below, which is a selective, sub-nanomolar inhibitor of the kinase, Pim1 [10] .

However, crucial issues involve rising costs, future sustainability of centralised tax-fi nanced systems, effi ciency and quality of the public services, and higher public expectations. In both Malaysia and Singapore, the health-care systems are changing from government-dominated health services towards greater private-sector involvement. Attempts to privatise public hospitals have been controversial, thus resulting in many hybrid forms of corporatised entities that continue to be controlled or subsidised by governments. [58] [59] [60] [61] Some of the most innovative and advanced forms of publicprivate mix in health services have developed within the region, for example the restructuring or corporatisation of public hospitals in Singapore from as early as 1985 and the later Swadana (self-fi nancing) hospitals in Indonesia. 62 With the anticipated rise in the ageing population and future problems of intergenerational funding through pay-as-you-go mechanisms, there are experiments with new health-care fi nancing such as compulsory medical savings and social insurance for long term care.

Modern medical technology is available in the world market but at costs higher than most of the region's population can aff ord. Many traditional health practices persist alongside the use of new medical technologies and pharmaceutical products, presenting regulatory problems in terms of safety and quality. With increasing educational levels, ageing populations, and growing consciousness of human rights in the recently developing democratic environment, the demand for better care is increasing. Health systems in the region face more serious adjustment problems than ever before. 51 Health services have become an important industry, with a mix of public and private non-profi t and for-profi t actors, along with the growth of trade and medical tourism. The provision, fi nancing, and regulatory functions of the public sector have to adapt accordingly to these transformations. The need to restructure healthcare delivery and fi nancing systems becomes crucial to balance new demand and supply equilibriums. 52, 53 Countries in southeast Asia and their health system reforms can thus be categorised according to the stages of development of their health-care systems. A typology of common issues, challenges, and priorities are generated for the diverse mix of health systems of southeast Asia at diff erent stages of socioeconomic development (see webappendix pp 5-8). The pressures placed on national health-care systems by the recent demographic and epidemiological transitions that we have described are amplifi ed by the growing demands of an increasingly educated and affl uent population for high quality health care and the supply of the latest medical technology. Before the east Asian fi nancial crisis in 1997-98 and the recent global economic recession, an expanding middle class in the urban populations of the larger cities pushed their demand for high quality care into a booming private sector.

During this period there was a structural shift away from large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), although these still remain an important part of the economy. Between 1997 and 2003 the government oversaw reform of SOEs, with many poorly performing businesses privatized or liquidated. Stronger firms were restructured and often listed on the stock market.

From a practical point of view, when it comes to clinical diagnostics, the doctors firmly insist on disposable devices to maintain an absolute sterile environment for the assay, and reduce ambiguity of determining results. This poses serious cost issue to microfluidics because currently they are just too expensive. Even channel free systems such as surface-based microfluidics relying on electrowetting is too costly. They are actually very interesting examples of versatile microfluidics systems due to the fact that they can be easily reprogrammed so that the layout of the microfluidics channel can be quickly changed. However, the reality is that for routine testing/ diagnoses we do not need to change the microfluidics layout because there are simple techniques to achieve it so the versatility is not always needed. In this case, the technology can be considered overkill.",15.618672270603831,6.95605219668125

Building Global Partnerships. The building of public private partnerships is proving to be one of the most effective global strategies to address the needs of disadvantaged populations living in the midst of neglected diseases [31] that are no longer considered to be a priority in industrialized nations [32] [33] [34] . If established in a balanced manner, public-private partnerships can bring together the power, resources, and experience from both the industrialized and the developing world to create synergies, define priorities, and find solutions. There are many examples of successful public private partnerships that have pooled their resources and have coordinated global strategies to increase the availability of scarce and expensive medical interventions for those that need them most. For example, the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) consists of a partnership between academic and research institutions, advocacy and resource mobilization partners, country representatives, international development agencies and foundations, international organizations, nongovernmental development organizations, and private sector companies [35] . This group retains a ""light governance structure"" that provides the flexibility to focus on specific needs at regional and national levels [35] . Several attempts at regional or international partnerships in rabies prevention and control have occurred throughout the 20th century. For example, once oral vaccination of wildlife became a reality during the 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) held multiple consultations involving its global network of WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Rabies for an organized approach towards red fox rabies elimination in Western Europe. The breadth and longevity of several other partnerships, such as the Rabies in the Americas Association, Latin-America National Rabies Directors Network (REDIPRA), Southern and Eastern Africa Rabies Group (SEARG), Rabies in Asia Foundation (RIA), Asia Rabies Expert Bureau (AREB), Africa Rabies Expert Bureau (AFROREB), and the recently created Middle East and Central Eastern Europe Rabies Expert Bureau (MEEREB), all demonstrate the utility of coalitions in successful information flow and regional health promotion in bringing support to local scientific and public health communities worldwide. As consistently observed by all existing rabies networks, basic education of people exposed to the risk of infection, the appropriate training of human and animal health professionals, and necessary advocacy by local health decision makers, are major milestones towards global rabies control. The North American Rabies Management Team is another recent example of professionals in Canada, Mexico, and the United States working together, sharing surveillance data, prioritizing applied research needs, and cooperating across the continent, in training and technology transfer, which allows the implementation of human and animal rabies control programs, achieving a drastic decrease of rabies cases in this region of the world.",15.261593384646712,6.636608535136947

In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, a substantial proportion of the dog population is unrestricted or semirestricted (stray), neither under direct control of their owners nor confined by a physical barrier [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . This term encompasses both owned and unowned roaming dogs and does not distinguish whether the dog has an ""owner"" or ""guardian"". Indeed, in many countries, the majority of dogs defined as roaming are owned, but are allowed to roam on public property for all or part of the day. These dogs fall into an institutional vacuum. They are not included in any conventional health care system as compared to other species recognized as disease vectors (for example, insect vectors of malaria or dengue) that are controlled as part of public health control programs. Dogs are neither a species that the agricultural sector/veterinary services are inclined to take full responsibility for as, unlike livestock species, they are not a recognized economic commodity. Only fully owned and restricted dogs, which are a minority in countries where canine rabies is prevalent, are generally of interest, but mostly to private veterinary practitioners. As a consequence, in many rabies-affected countries, veterinary services and private veterinarians do not have the will nor the desire to prioritize and allocate the resources required to control a disease that is primarily seen as a public health issue with limited impact on production animal health or small animal private practice.",15.52255186784865,6.137006710191672

Airlines, multinational hotel chains, cruise and tour operators servicing multiple destinations, and global financial institutions were far more amenable to regional destination marketing than the private sector during the 1990s. The major regional travel industry association PATA was, until the 1990s, primarily oriented towards America. The relocation of its headquarters from San Francisco to Bangkok in 1998 represented the realization of its organizational evolution from an America-centric association in its early years to an Asia-centric organization by the mid-1990s. PATA took over the role of regional SE Asian tourism marketing abandoned by ASEAN during the 1990s (Chuck and Lurie, 2001) . Although IATA's global headquarters remained in Switzerland, it maintained a high-profile presence in Asia (interview: Concil, 2003) . By 1997, SE Asian tourism growth was increasingly sourced from within Asia. During the 1990s Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (the so-called Tiger Economies) had become significant SE Asia source markets. The Asian economic collapse resulted in a 2-year hiatus to this growth. The emergence of India and the People's Republic of China as rapidly growing tourism generating markets promised long-term tourism growth for SE Asian tourism destinations. The quantum growth of mass Chinese outbound tourism exacerbated competitive pressures largely due to the PRC government policy of limiting approved destinations for Chinese nationals. The criteria for a country to become an approved destination for Chinese citizens included operational and political elements. Murray Bailey's report on the Chinese outbound market commissioned by PATA in 2001 provides a detailed guide to the growth forecasts and the specific qualifications for approved destination status (Bailey, 2001) .",21.112285326220878,9.752079302672943

PCR amplification allows the precise detection and identification of a specific DNA molecule by using specific primers to amplify a defined fragment of the target DNA molecule. In order to detect specific RNA molecules, hence specific RNA viruses, the RNA molecules must first be converted to DNA molecules for PCR detection. This process is referred to as reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The specificity, sensitivity and effectiveness of PCR and RT-PCR have been well demonstrated in the detection of viruses, providing the basis for a number of molecular diagnostic assays (Castro et al., 2004; Gibbs et al., 2005; Kaltenboeck and Wang, 2005; Nagasse-Sugahara et al., 2004) . To date most of these assays depend upon access to quite sophisticated laboratories, having the necessary equipment and expertise. However, the risk of disease outbreak may be substantially higher in remote areas and underdeveloped regions, where the performance of nucleic acid analysis is financially and technologically challenging, particular for mobile 'in-the-field' testing. Some inexpensive thermal cyclers having low power usage for in-the-field nucleic acid analysis have been developed (Belgrader et al., 1999 (Belgrader et al., , 2001 Kopp et al., 1998; Krishnan et al., 2002; Wheeler et al., 2004) . These devices perform temperature cycling by flowing reactions through different temperature zones. They can be powered by battery and have successfully detected bacterial DNA with PCR (Belgrader et al., 1999 (Belgrader et al., , 2001 . However, extracting viral RNA for use with these cyclers is more challenging than obtaining bacterial DNA by boiling the samples (Belgrader et al., 1999) . Also, when developing devices for large-scale distribution in underdeveloped areas, low cost, simple and durable devices are most desirable. Electricity is essential for most laboratory equipments in the developed world, but is rarely available and luxury in many of those areas most at risk of viral outbreaks. Therefore, simple portable free standing devices for easy in-the-field usage must be developed.",14.523456158903512,10.407161126468127

However, for many organisms, both novel and characterized, the necessary spectrum of sequence data is lacking. This is particularly so for newly described organisms.

Although typically applied to for-profit contexts, we can consider the process of innovative disruption, which circumvents incumbents to effectively provide an alternative that catches an underserved market or outperforms. Shifting a portion of global health investments from reactionary approaches to preventive capacity could support development of needed renewable technologies such as solar microgrids; building local capacity for installation and maintenance could reduce cost and technological barriers for uptake and use.

This can occur in several ways, including the coproduction of knowledge (eg, coordinated research question generation) and, where findings are not interpretable to direct action, translating relevance to a given sector(s). For example, health scientists could take risk projection findings further to calculate the cost of inaction or the gains of solution scenarios or the scientific community could examine the cumulative health impacts associated with ecosystem alteration, and help to identify and refine implementation strategies to address these challenges in a more coordinated fashion. Even within the scientific community itself, however, collaboration is not routine, despite potential research, understanding, and intervention efficiencies. To promote collaboration across scientific disciplines and bridge research and policy oriented toward sustainability solutions, the Future Earth scientific platform was established in 2014, merging international global change projects representing atmospheric sciences, ecosystem services, health, urbanization, and other disciplines. For this model to be optimized, some baseline challenges will need to be overcome: common metrics and data sharing systems do not currently exist, research investments typically are still oriented to single-discipline approaches, understanding of long-term trends is limited by the short-term nature of research funding, and (outside of clinical medicine) pathways are generally not yet in place for wide-scale research-to-solution processes. Industry and private-sector collaboration are also crucial for multidisciplinary solutions, but programmatically, health organizations face resource challenges in raising awareness and combatting the ill effects of fossil fuel-related pollution. For example, the WHO's entire 2014-2015 approved budget (US$3.98 billion) is a stark contrast to the almost $550 billion granted in annual global fossil fuel subsidies. 66 The short-term societal focus on profits derived from fossil fuel extraction and consumption have overall represented a major barrier to stronger climatechange regulation.

This suggests that, following a rise in the NHS budget and the consequent expansion of the health sector, the increased demand for intermediate inputs from this sector outweighs the reduced availability of skilled labour relative to unskilled labour. Also, most of the unskilled-intensive sectors contract, apart from construction and the medical instruments sector. The latter's expansion is much more pronounced and, as before, is likely to be due to the intermediate demand effect from the health sector, rather than the increased availability of unskilled relative to skilled labour. The predictions of the theoretical Heckscher-Ohlin model thus do not carry over completely to the applied CGE model, providing a strong argument for the use of the latter.",17.390984966837035,9.744200774102342

It also means that the same strategy could be applied to other BSL-4 pathogens, such as Lassa, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Junin viruses, in addition to highly pathogenic emerging viruses. Looking ahead, throughput for HTS assays conducted in high-containment laboratories could be improved by going to higher density 1,536 microtiter plates in place of the currently used 384 version. Bacterial and yeast assays have been conducted at BSL-2 23 in a 1,536-well microplate format and short-term viral assays also have the potential to be done in this format; each of these could be implemented in higher containment laboratories when the throughput is needed. New technologies present an opportunity to bring different types of assays into HTS for infectious agents. Multimode plate readers have been used to monitor a wide variety of endpoints, including fluorescence, absorbance, fluorescence polarization, and luminescence, proximity-based endpoints like fluorescence resonance energy transfer or alphascreen and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The use of high-content images has recently been incorporated into the HTS process. Moreover, while this is possible in BSL-2 containment laboratories, it is not practical to have the current generation of HCS instruments in higher level containment laboratories. The instruments are large and require significant service support, both of which are impractical in a BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory. What is practical are laser scanning cytometers, which can perform many HCS-type assays using a small robust instrument that is no more difficult to manage than a multimode plate reader and almost as fast. Instruments like the TTP Acumen and Mirrorball and the Molecular Devices Velos fall into this category. The Mirrorball is unique in that it is a laser scanning cytometer with a narrow field of focus. This enables plate-based FACS and ELISA style assays in a no-wash format. This instrument has been used to monitor cell surface expression of viral proteins by addition of an antibody, specific to the viral protein of interest, directly to the assay plate. This is followed by addition of a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. The plate is then imaged on the laser scanning cytometer to detect cell-associated fluorescence as a measure of viral infection. This can be done without a fixing step or any wash steps. It has also been used to monitor virus infection and the spread of a GFP expressing virus (unpublished data). This is an enabling technology that will allow development of HTS assays for viruses that do not produce CPE or cannot be modified to express a reporter gene. It can also be used to monitor expression of fluorescent proteins in engineered viruses or cell lines, expanding the types of assays that can be applied to antiviral drug discovery. Another technology that has become more common in HTS applications is qPCR, where it has been used as a secondary assay to monitor mRNA levels in compoundtreated cells. At the SR HTS Center, qPCR technology has also been used to quantify the number of virus particles directly from the supernatant taken from infected cells. This provides a way to monitor virus titer reduction as an assay endpoint. Development is underway to adapt this technology to qPCR in a 1,536-well format for screening in the BSL-2 laboratory. For high-containment laboratories, the 384well format may be the practical limit and while that might not be high enough throughput for an HTS campaign, it would be a powerful counter screen for compounds identified in the other types of assays described here.",19.171593254844453,9.589751087739106

Global and national-level policies have highly influenced access to health care and education in many developing nations. Following independence, many newly emerging nations began to accumulate a large amount of debt and experienced a growing financial imbalance. Loans were sought from the WB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Large loans were given with the stipulation that the country would restructure its economy by improving the management of payments, increase economic efficiency, and encourage private sector investments: Structured Adjustment Programs (SAP). The emphasis was on economic development, not social services. Education and health services were viewed as nonproductive, and to ''save the country's economy'' many service programs were sold to private firms where unfortunately, profits took priority over services. Governmental social safety nets were lost as user fees for health care and education were another stipulation for WB and IMF loans. Local governments received an immediate cash flow and shed the responsibilities and expense of providing services to the citizens. Local officials were happy but the people suffered. Relegating social services to the private sector meant limiting access to health care and education. User fees for these services, including the purchase of clean water, deepened the level of poverty and of health as the poor could not afford even modest fees and did without. Some SAPs demanded an increase in exports of goods and food, which limited domestic consumption. To their credit, members of the WB saw the deterioration of health care and educational opportunities, and recently have tried to reverse these trends.

During the early to mid-1990s, access to, and the quality of, some health services were impaired as a result of government budget cutbacks. As a consequence, public confidence in the system was eroded although most Canadians remained committed to the solidarity principles underlying Medicare (Romanow, 2002) . Since the late 1990s, both federal and provincial governments have been reinvesting in public health care in an effort to improve quality and reduce waiting time. This public reinvestment in health care has triggered concerns about the fiscal sustainability of Medicare. In reality, most of the cost drivers appear to be in the mixed and private categories of health services rather than Medicare services. In particular, the growth of private and public prescription drug plans has been in excess of double the rate in growth of hospital and physician expenditures. Despite this, most media and think tank commentators continue to focus on Medicare, occasionally suggesting alternatives to the current single-payer model of administration. These arguments were given considerable political support in a recent Supreme Court of Canada judgment. In the now famous Chaoulli case, the court concluded that the Quebec government's prohibition on private insurance for Medicare services violated the province's Charter of Rights in a situation in which a patient waits an unreasonable amount of time for elective surgery. While the decision is not likely to lead to private, multipayer insurance for Medicare services, it has fueled the ongoing debate concerning the appropriate divide between the public and the private sector in financing, administration, and delivery of health care in Canada.",20.29382985172488,8.357760603844982

Over the past 10 years, the per base cost for sequencing has decreased 10,000-fold, from $5,000 per megabase using capillary electrophoresis to $0.5 per megabase using the Illumina platform [46, 47] . Accordingly, as the volume of sequence data has grown exponentially in individual experiments and international data repositories, the challenge has shifted from sequence acquisition to analysis. A key determinant in the complexity of bioinformatics analysis is the read length, which ranges from 150 bp on the Illumina HiSeq or MiSeq instruments to 700 bp on the Roche GS FLX Titanium pyrosequencer [46, 48] . The shorter the read length, the greater the number of calculations needed to assemble continuous strings of genomic sequence. An additional challenge on some instruments (e.g. GS FLX and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine [PGM]) is the uncertainty of base identification caused by nucleotide homopolymers [46, [49] [50] [51] [52] . Although single molecule sequencers are in development that promise to provide both fidelity and long strings of sequence data, the current strategy for many investigators is to use the GS FLX or PGM platforms to generate a scaffold for assembling and mapping sequence data from Illumina instruments [53] [54] [55] . Irrespective of platform, the process following sequence acquisition is similar for pathogen discovery: contiguous sequences are assembled, host sequence is subtracted, and the residual sequences are examined for similarity to known microbial sequences at the nucleotide or amino acid level [56, 57] . Where no similarities are found, one can examine nucleotide composition and/or order for patterns consistent with viral genera and host species. This approach can also help in deciding which sequences merit further analysis, an important advantage particularly in examining fecal specimens where sequences may represent viruses infecting the host, or a plant or animal consumed by host [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Although investigations of individual cases or outbreaks of disease still typically focus first on testing for the presence of specific agents using singleplex or syndrome-specific multiplex assays, as the costs of sequencing continues to decrease, instruments become more portable and methods for sample preparation and sequence analysis become more user friendly, we anticipate that sequencing will move to the forefront of clinical diagnosis as well as discovery.",13.536505747554328,7.130256616126665

Although these tests have become substantially easier to implement, their performance is still dependent on specimen quality and technician training, because environmental contamination can easily confound accurate interpretation of results. Serologic assays-such as those based on immunofluorescence, immunochromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbence and live-virus or pseudovirus neutralization-vary in their performance characteristics, but provide benefits over NAATs in the form of easier implementation and more functionally relevant readouts 8 . The performance of any assay, particularly with respect to MERS-CoV, depends on when it is administered during the natural history of disease. A more detailed understanding of the key features of the clinical course of MERS-CoV infection is, therefore, needed to inform the optimization of existing assays and the development of next-generation diagnostics. It was generally agreed that, even in the absence of these data, there is an urgent need 18 . One of the lessons learned from the Hendra experience is that preclinical development and animal-model testing in relevant smaller animal models should be extensive before efficacy trials are commenced in larger-animal target populations, such as horses, or in the case of MERS-CoV, dromedary camels. Downselection of vaccine candidates in smaller animals increases the likelihood of success in large animals, which is crucial because the costs are much higher and logistical challenges much greater in the latter models. An additional lesson to take from previous experiences with animal vaccines for human health is to engage affected populations and educate them on the potential benefits and risks of a vaccine for their animals (i.e., camels) and communities. One of the difficulties facing the development of effective vaccines for MERS-CoV is the absence of an animal model that recapitulates the pathogenesis and natural history of severe human disease. Two presentations and pipelines and stressed that most vaccines fail to advance beyond phase 1 testing because of a lack of interest from funders and limited industrial support. In the realm of emerging infectious diseases with suspected or known pandemic potential, governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations might have a key role in the development of interventions against diseases that do not provide a strong incentive for private-sector investments, but that are still relevant to public health and global security.",19.998615937738123,10.999038180766478

Part of the problem is that some firms do provide extra medical benefits for their workers, and feel that this is enough. Others, especially in Europe, provide some employees, usually at managerial levels, with stays in spas, presumably to recover from the stress of decision-making!. Hence such firms are reluctant to also contribute to general health care schemes for which the benefits seem to be beyond their immediate interests. In some cities there are signs that private firms see the advantages in participating in schemes to promote better health, especially when there are new business opportunities. This is certainly the case in Helsinki where the promotion of new technology, a focus on health and new organizations to promote healthy living, has led to many initiatives (Otgaar et al. 2011) . For example, Forum Virium (FV) was established with support from major national organizations and companies to promote and create new digital services in several areas, including health care. This led to a photo and diary service for day-care centres to provide parents with images of their children's activities, a service that has subsequently spread to many countries, creating a new business venture. In addition, FV helped create the Healthy Helsinki programme that initiated several ventures to improve health through citizen empowerment, such as a Mobile Health project. Set up with help from telecom companies, it enabled participants to monitor their leisure and exercise levels, getting positive feedback through mobile devices if they increased their levels in attempts to change their behaviour. Elsewhere the development of computerized Personal Health Records, together with interactive mobile devices, has not only enabled users to store their own data but provide access to training, life-style and nutrition advice while in a neighbouring town it led to the monitoring of the growth in children, which identified abnormalities. More generally there are increasing numbers of smart applications for health-related issues being provided for use by smart or mobile phones, such as regular personal contacts to reduce isolation. Also, organizations such as the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (TRI) are not only treating patients with long term disabilities from injury or aging, but actively pursue commercialization of their new technical products, such as their SlingSerter and RoboNurse for lifting patients (TRI). They are also in the forefront of research in providing assistance to people with cognitive impairment through smart alert systems to remind people to turn-off stoves and taps, and how and when to complete many regular routines, through sensing devices; in addition, like the Japanese, they are also building robots to help with these tasks. Such devices also provide help and relief to carers, but enable people to live longer in their homes rather than being forced into homes for the aged or hospitals, which dramatically increase costs of care.",24.182468917778518,9.92383458950518

Arguably, the merits of planning can only be possible given that a plan can be implemented in the first place. As such, experts suggest implementation be considered in the planning process; and a plan be practically made for this purpose (Cooper, Gilbert, Fletcher, & Wanhill, 1993; Gunn, 2002; Inskeep, 1991; McIntosh, Goeldner, & Ritchie, 1995; Shepherd, 1998; Veal, 2002) .

This situation creates a gap between planning and implementation (hereafter GPI), and has led to the failure of tourism plans. For instance, studies have recorded the failure of tourism development plans caused by lack of analytical details or miscalculations regarding the control of land usage (Cooper et al., 1993; Shepherd, 1998) , the failure of central planning caused by lack of community involvement (Tosun & Jenkins, 1996) , as well as mismatch between central planning and local possibilities (Burns & Sancho, 2003) .

This situation reflects the historical cultural and governance context of urban China, where highly centralised decision making is emphasised and there is a reluctance to empower non-government decision makers.

By 2016, 80% of urban residents worked in the private sector, which also generates 60% of national GDP. 30 The private sector has an enormous influence on the health of employees and communities and a responsibility to address its effect on urban health and the environment. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that corporate involvement and investment in public health can create valuable opportunities for business. 320 In line with WHO recommendations, 305 healthy cities in China should use the private sector's potential to provide health-related services, support the adoption of health-promoting behaviours, and contribute to initiatives that are relevant to public health. To date, private sector involvement in health care in China is still small. Just 20% of urban hospitals in 2008 were privately owned and the market share of private health insurance was not substantial. 321 Just 12¬∑3% of all medical treatment visits between January, and November, 2016 were to private sector facilities. 322 New policies are needed to encourage the private sector to invest more in health facilities and provide health services, especially to serve marginalised populations. At the same time, relevant regulatory and supervisory mechanisms need to be strengthened to improve the quality and consistency of private sector health care. 323 The private sector also has great potential for new investment in health technologies (eg, internet health and mobile health). For example, WeChat, which is the most popular messaging app in China, has been shown to be effective in health promotion, patient care, monitoring, diagnosis, and public health communication. 324 The private sector should also invest more in employee health and occupational safety. This situation is win-win because improvements in health can benefit businesses through reduced health-care expenditures, increased revenue, and improved reputation. Although, in some cities, privately-owned businesses have been involved in health promotion campaigns, the scale of such programmes is limited and is essentially based on voluntary participation. Therefore, there is substantial room for expansion. The private sector can also contribute to promoting healthy behaviour among customers or consumers more broadly. For example, a recent collaboration between the public health agency and a restaurant chain in Beijing aimed to cut salt content in food, benefiting customers and boosting the image of the company as health-conscious (panel 11).",35.910286426887474,12.516210730680273

Although people may empower themselves with- out waiting for intervention from domestic authorities or international,"There are two critical points that link the human security perspective with the practice to realize the SDGs. The first relates to the role of the government. Although the SDGs seek a strong alliance with the private sector and civil society, Article 41 of Agenda 2030 notes that the state can play a significant role: ""We recognize that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development."" Second, the SDGs appear to pay less attention to risks and resilience that feature the discourses of human security, and this gap is expected to open a new field of complementary action. As Fig. 14.1 shows, the process of human development cannot be a linear progress. If development is the process of expanding people's freedom, human security aims at removing sources of people's unfreedom. Calamities such as wars, armed conflicts, outbreaks of infectious diseases, and natural and human-made disasters pounce upon a wide swath of people at a time. The focus on these ""downside risks"" is part of the theoretical underpinnings of the human security concept (Sen 2014) . In the risk-prone societies of our time, even though both haves and have-nots are equally exposed to cross-border threats such as air pollution, multiple risks compel the most vulnerable people to suffer most, intensifying their insecurities (Beck 1992) .

Translation of the Global Fund model to NTDs seems logical. These diseases impact the poorest and have a significant global burden of disease, require a sustainable funding mechanism and harmonization of stakeholder/donor activities, may be treated by low-cost drugs that can be available as generics, and require health system strengthening and scale-up of treatment delivery. Further, many NTD-focused partnerships have already engaged the private sector in drug discovery and medicine donations (58) . All of these areas are within the operational expertise of the Global Fund, and this governance structure would seem apropos to the management issues for NTD efforts.",22.415640970514715,10.687578923658803

This is especially true for individuals who are paying out of pocket. When medicines are unavailable in the public sector, patients are forced to purchase them in the private sector using out-of-pocket resources. 132 Between 2007 and 2014, generic medicines were available in an average of 58% of public health facilities in LICs and lower-MICs (availability ranged from 17% to 100%). 133 Aff ordability is particularly problematic when medicines must be taken on a continuing basis, such as for the management of chronic communicable or noncommunicable conditions. Unlike AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, NCDs have not been the target of new global funding facilities. Diff erences in aff ordability also exist within the NCDs group: essential medicines for cancer and diabetes are often less aff ordable than treatments for hypertension. 134 Nonetheless, a study of private pharmacy prices for four commonly used cardiovascular medicines in 18 countries showed that they were potentially unaff ordable for at least some patients in every country.

According to annual statistics from the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan (2003 Taiwan ( , 2004 , tourism revenues accounted for 4.39% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996 and 5.31% of the GDP in 2001. These figures exceeded the contribution of agriculture to the GDP in each year, showing that tourism has become a major industry in Taiwan. Kim et al. (2006) further demonstrated that tourism expansion in Taiwan has a long-run equilibrium relationship with economic growth, and moreover, tourism expansion and economic growth reinforce each other. In other words, tourism development strengthens the Taiwanese economy, and an expanding economy also enhances the tourism industry. These empirical findings offered important guidance for government and private tourism policy makers and authorities in Taiwan. Because of the long-running equilibrium relationship and the twoway causality between tourism and economic development, both the tourism segment and other major industries require attention to stimulate both the tourism sector and the overall economy.

Of the 68 surgeons surveyed, 40 (59%) reported seeing patients with complications or poor results and 15 (22%) reported treating more than one patient. Most women seeking treatment had undergone breast enlargements or reductions or facelifts. The majority of procedures were reportedly performed in Thailand (66), followed by Malaysia (17) . 72 The issue of who should bear the costs of complications was raised in a report from Australia of Mycobacterium fortuitum infection of a total knee arthroplasty, performed in India. 73 The patient had been advised to pursue a course of symptomatic treatment for osteoarthritis but elected to pay $8,600 for the surgical option over concerns of waiting time in the public sector, cost in the private sector, and desire for early return to work. Treatment for the septic joint, with an organism not commonly encountered in Australia, involved four separate surgeries and antimycobacterial therapy, resulting in a cost of $140,000. The procedure had been done in a hospital accredited by the JCI, rates of infection in the procedure worldwide are known to be 1% to 2%, and it was acknowledged that even if 1 patient in 20 develops an infection, having the operation overseas is an economically viable option. However, the case illustrates many of the issues in medical tourism: exposure to infections of different types or higher prevalence than at home, the lack of ability to address the root source of adverse events and effect change, the wisdom of undertaking major surgery away from one's home environment (especially when long-haul air travel before major surgery significantly increases the risk of perioperative venous thromboembolism 74 ), and in the event a complication does occur, the fairness of using resources that could fund procedures for multiple patients to treat one who had disregarded medical advice. Patients in this situation have little legal recourse 75 and may also encounter a radically different cultural framework of reference, based in part on the local perception of an individual's decision to seek care away from home. The president of the Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons of Thailand is quoted as saying that all plastic surgery is ''improvement not perfection,'' and patients must realize there are drawbacks to traveling to another country for medical care. ''How can a doctor look after patients if they go back to their country? You have to accept there are disadvantages if something goes wrong.'' 76",15.95443386154211,6.731881786494381

The outbreaks are associated with huge economic and social impact in many countries. During such a short time as the last 18 months, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE, World Organisation for Animal Health) reported the occurrences of a high number of TAD outbreaks, e.g., foot-and-mouth disease on three continents (Africa, Asia and South America), classical swine fever (Africa, Asia, and Europe), rinderpest (Africa, Asia), or highly pathogenic avian influenza (Africa, Asia, and Europe). The costs should be viewed both in terms of efforts to bring the disease under control and the consequent loss of livelihoods. Concerning the EU, during the last decade the member states have suffered from a rather high number of devastating outbreaks of diseases notifiable to OIE. The European Commission Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare report (adopted 24-25th April 2003) has stated: ""Recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), classical swine fever (CSF) and avian influenza (AI) have occurred in several member states and resulted in the slaughter of large numbers of animals as well as severe economic consequences"". As an example, with regard to the UK FMD outbreak in 2001, the cost to the public sector was estimated at over 4.5 billion euro, and the cost to the private sector at over 7.5 billion euro. The ethical problem risen under the current eradication strategy and the social consequences of the slaughter of large numbers of animals must also be taken into account when considering the effects of the diseases notifiable to OIE: (http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/A DSUM.htm).",15.331623341716973,6.28489230287788

Barro and Sala i Martin (1995, pp. 171-198) and Azomahou et al. (2006) , in particular, provide useful summaries of attempts to capture the effects of a Spanish Flu-like epidemic (one which has massive immediate effects) in both a one-sector framework and the two-sector framework of Lucas (1988) . Both approaches, however, suffer from a number of shortcomings. As Azomahou et al. (2006) note, the one-sector framework where physical and human capital are substitutes seems to be less suited to this purpose as it essentially reduces the epidemic to an ""initial condition shock"" whereby the economy returns to its steady state equilibrium after the mortality shock and one merely ends up studying the transitional dynamics. Furthermore, the role of demography in such a model plays only a minor role and does not impact the return to human capital in the short or long run. It does allow for a marked growth episode in the aftermath of the epidemic but only by virtue of the fact that the epidemic's depletion of human capital makes human capital accumulation more desirable in the post-epidemic period. The two-sector model, as per Lucas (1988) , allows for a more nuanced story as it differentiates between the production of physical and capital goods and assumes that there is an education sector that is more human capital intensive than the final good sector. This set-up allows population growth to impact on human capital production through the allocation of effort devoted to the production of human capital. An external effect of human capital can also be built into this set-up. However, Azomahou et al. (2006) point out that in the post-epidemic period the economy must allocate its scarce human capital between the education and final good sectors and might find it optimal to assign more human capital to the sector less intensive in human capitalthe final good sector. This is in contrast to the catching-up mechanism of the one-sector model and leads to a post-epidemic period of slow growth and high wages (due to the increased return to human capital).",15.735061165463295,5.524398185680289

Currently, the United States has a large enough stockpile of smallpox vaccine to vaccinate every person in the country who might need it in the event of an emergency. 70 The government also expects to stockpile nearly 8 million doses of an investigational vaccine against pandemic influenza, and studies are under way to develop mechanisms that could stretch that supply to cover more than one-third of the population. 71 CDC also maintains a large anthrax vaccine stockpile. Advance market commitments. Advance market commitments involve donors who commit to buying yet-to-be-developed vaccines in bulk for poor nations if drug makers are able to deliver a vaccine that meets specifications and a price can be settled on in advance. 72 Supporters of advance market commitments range from the GAVI partners to Pope Benedict XVI.

The cash received for the bonds then can be used for research and future purchase of vaccines. Whenever the bonds are issued, IFFIm pays bondholders a modest rate of interest. As money pledged by donor governments becomes available gradually over 30 years, these funds will be used to repay the capital value of the bonds. 69 IFFIm was able to double the resources GAVI has been able to allocate-$945.6 million in 2007 compared with $418.3 million in 2006. 74 Vaccine financing programs.

Private sector vaccine purchases are covered through private health insurance and account for 45% to 50% of the pediatric vaccines sold annually in the United States. 75 The federal government has played an evolving role in building the immunization structure in the United States. The earliest legislation pertaining to vaccine financing is the Social Security Act of 1935. Title V of this act pertains to immunization services for children and their mothers. In 1963, Congress enacted the Vaccine Assistance Act (Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act). This legislation provided grants to social service agencies and local health departments for immunization infrastructure and vaccine purchases. 41 However, barriers to immunization access still remained in some areas as a result of considerable variability in immunization efforts by state and local governments.",18.428458168136665,9.389755852927422

Many countries have invested in enhancing their fundamental public health surveillance and response systems. Various new programmes, projects and networks related to emerging diseases have also been initiated with the involvement of national governments, international organizations, development agencies, donors and partners (including the private sector) and academic or educational institutions. These efforts have helped improve the overall preparedness for emerging diseases in the region and globally. 12 The experiences and lessons learnt from implementation of the original Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases, or APSED (2005), and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 showed a clear need for harmonization, prioritization, coordination, collaboration and efficiency in addressing the common threats. Such a collective approach required an up-to-date, agreed upon strategic framework that is relevant to all countries, regions and international stakeholders. The World Health Organization (WHO), as the directing and coordinating agency for international health within the United Nations system, has played an essential role in developing such global and regional public health policies and strategies in consultation and collaboration with countries and areas, technical experts and partners.

Their targets are often so narrow as to neglect important development issues in the same sector-eg, tertiary education, reproductive health, and a range of gender issues. At their conception, therefore, the MDGs were not a plan derived bottom-up from a broad, intersectoral conceptualisation of development and prioritisation of development needs, although superfi cially they might seem to have been. These summaries also show that progress has varied between goals and between targets. Although some goals were set up with a range of targets and indicators, subsequent attention and monitoring for any goal has usually focused on a subset of these targets and indicators, sometimes only one. This narrowing process could be an indication of diff erences in ease of target implementation and monitoring, and in the level of ownership by international and other institutions, with little ownership or overlap in ownership reducing progress.

We draw attention to, for example, a growing acceptance of the need to address population growth, to recognise and restrict the environmental eff ect of human activities, and to understand the limitations of growth based on capitalism and neo-liberalism as a system for delivery of sustainable development. These issues have been ones for which comprehensive agreement is diffi cult to obtain from states with diff erent ideologies and political systems, but they can no longer be avoided. Unterhalter and Carpentier 101 set out this challenge in terms of a so-called development tetralemma faced in the pursuit of mechanisms and systems that simultaneously promote equity, growth, democracy, and sustainability (in which a tetralemma is defi ned as analogous to a dilemma, but involving a set of four crucially important options for which each is necessary but not suffi cient for sustainable development, and they cannot all be achieved together). Almost all present political and economic mechanisms and systems can only achieve some of these at the expense of others; hence they are compromised even in their initial achievements.

Elsewhere in the 1990s a wave of privatisation occurred in Russia and Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism, which involved former government run organisations passing over to private management control. Then in the United States where there are fewer state owned enterprises, privatisation commonly relates to the contracting out or leasing of assets. Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs) are a type of privatisation, popular in both developing and developed regions, where typically there is private capital for, and management of, some major new infrastructure project, along with eventual public ownership. Overall, whilst the experiences of all these types of privatisations may well be very different, they can all loosely be interpreted as the transfer of economic activity from the public sector to the private sector.",25.028028008976733,11.896034651173853

In some cases, for example with a share flotation, airports face little in the way of continuing state governance conditions other than those faced by any commercial company. By contrast with other models, for example airport concessions or leases, a significant amount of public sector influence remains as in these cases only operation and not actually ownership is transferred to the private sector. These types of privatisations are popular in developing countries where there tends to be a strong need for major expansion and modernisation but lack of government resources. Alternatively governments can choose to only partially privatise the airportsagain stopping them from relinquishing all control to the private operators. It is evident from that only a minority of privatisations have involved total ownership being handed over to the private sector. In most cases, and particularly in continental Europe, partial privatisation has been the more popular option (ACI-Europe, 2010). Meanwhile in North America, there has been a reluctance to move away from the status quo with local public ownership remaining the norm in the United States (with only a very limited experiment of an Airport Privatization Pilot Program) and with a 'not-for-profit' governance model in Canada rather than more conventional privatisation (Federal Aviation Authority, 2010; Transport Canada, 2010).

Improvements to management structure and the use of new skills (including technology) were also discussed in 14 papers. Specifically Assaf (2010) debated how privatisation can encourage new management styles, marketing skills and better investment decisions whilst Mew (2000), Humphreys (1999) and Vogel (2006b) , discussed how it can bring consumer oriented business competencies and skills. Carney and Mew (2003) argued that governance reform (including privatisation) can lead to new technology and act as a catalyst for innovation. Within this context, Vasign and Haririan (1996, 90 ) stated how 'the private sector is more flexible and could mobilize resources with greater speed in order to design, build and operate airports' whilst Niemeier (2002, 46) talked of the 'influx of know-how' brought by privatisation and Ohta (1999, 229) of the 'promotion of entrepreneurship'. Risk may be reduced since airports may draw on a specialised set of management skills (Freestone et al., 2006) or they may be less likely to undertake unprofitable projects (Vasign and Gorjidooz, 2006) . Indeed with reference to Asia, Booth (2007, 217) stated that 'privatisation is driven as much from technology and skill transfer from western countries as it is by transferring investment and management to the private sector'. Janecke (2010, 10) added 'Whereas there may be ideological motives in the West, governments in developing countries are driven by more practical issues: the lack of investment resources and/or the lack of management knowhow'. In addition it was argued that privatisation and new management will encourage diversification and the development of nonaeronautical revenues and new business fields (Freestone et al., 2006; Gerber, 2002; Kramer, 2004) .",23.548924452251292,10.762634505992267

The same costs of disease and disease avoidance that drive private contact and mixing decisions become potential points of leverage on contact and mixing behavior. If the social decision-maker is able to alter those costs through, for example, taxes, subsidies, access fees, penalties, and so on, then the social decision-maker is also able to change private behavior and disease dynamics (Francis 1997; Auld 2003; Francis 2004) . For example, where tracking mechanisms allow the sale of diseased animals to be traced back to a specific hub in the supply chain, opening the responsible individuals up to legal penalties provides them with an incentive to exercise care.

This complements the essential and more topdown efforts of the WHO's strategy for epidemic alert and response that also relies on collaborative partners, including WHO Collaborating Centres, nongovernmental organizations, and industry. 7 Countries, therefore, will benefit from the renewed impetus to strengthen national capacity in surveillance and response and from the enhanced access to international investors interested in improving health in countries across the world, in the interest of global health and security. 7",29.088903386936455,13.094570610762688

A clinical laboratory may make changes in their assays for a variety of reasons, including replacement of a discontinued assay or improvement in the accuracy, cost effectiveness, or turnaround time with a new assay. The impact of these changes can be minimized, if the substitute assay is chosen so that it closely matches the results of the previous assay. It also is useful to run both assays in parallel for a short period of time to establish a regression equation relating the two assays. Using such an equation, the investigator can convert the results of one assay to the other, to reduce the increased variance from the multiple assays. It also is important to carefully establish the reference interval of the new assay and to interpret the results in the context of this new range when the two assays differ significantly. In the case of tumor markers, which can often show substantial differences between assays, it may be necessary to offer both assays in parallel for an extended period of time until all the patients are ""re-baselined"" with the new assay. It is critically important to communicate with the primary investigators in the setting of an assay that is undergoing a change so they understand why the assay is being changed and the potential impact of this on their protocols.

RISK, RIGHTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES","The levels of public trust in a particular national culture will also influence rights as risk perspectives.89 Lesley Jacobs, in a study of the divergent uses of quarantine in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Toronto during the SARS crisis, attributes the more extensive use of quarantine in Toronto to the particular legal consciousness of senior public health officials: ‚Äòhealth security was weighed much more heavily than rights concerns ‚Ä¶ whereas in Hong Kong and Shanghai there was much more of an even balance‚Äô.90 But, even though there was dissent in Toronto, courts and human rights bodies were not used to raise concerns about rights violations. One federal public health official has speculated that:
The belief that the decisions about SARS by senior public officials, provided that they had a legal basis, would be made fairly was so deeply ingrained among the public that there was little need to question or scrutinize those decisions.91
Jacobs's explanation for the non-use of courts is that legal avenues of redress might not be seen as appropriate ‚Äòwhere the health security of the community is at stake‚Äô.92 From an organisational risk perspective, this phenomenon could be used as a reason to dismiss rights as a risk and, more specifically, to downgrade the need for rights protection in preparedness planning and implementation. This, however, would be counter-productive. As James Childress and Ruth Gaare Bernheim have argued, ‚Äòpublic justification, deliberation, and other relationship-building activities may be more important for biopreparedness than state power because they maintain and nurture civic ideals, cooperation, and trust‚Äô.93 Moreover, Childress and Gaare Bernheim's argument can be extended to encompass the role of the private sector in sustaining public trust during an emergency.

Diagnostic expertise was particularly important in this case, as the pandemic strain had to be detected against a background of other circulating influenza A strains and other respiratory viruses causing influenza-like illness.32 The influenza example demonstrates the positive impact that collaboration between global and national stakeholders and industry can have on the speed and effectiveness of response. Similar networks of diagnostic experts and laboratories for other relevant pathogens that can be activated in the event of an outbreak would greatly improve research and development times. Both academic and private sector stakeholders would be included with a focus on maximising knowledge sharing and accelerating innovation, in an environment that encourages collaboration rather than competition between developers.

Such is the case in Ecuador, where the healthcare system is divided into the public and private sectors. The public sector is comprised of The Armed Forces Institute of Security, and Social Security of the National Police ‚Äì responsible for the health of the armed forces and police members, respectively, the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (IESS) ‚Äì covering public sector employees, and private sector organizations and individuals which pay into IESS and the Ministry of Public Health ‚Äì responsible for the population which is otherwise uninsured (Lucio et al. 2011). There has been a concerted effort to improve accessibility and indeed attempt to provide universal health care to its populations both by increasing the accessibility to the Ministry of Public Health services and by increasing the population covered under IESS. These efforts led to an impressive increase in the percentage of ensured population from 21.36% in 2006 to 41.44% in 2014 (National Institute of Statistics 2015) and concomitantly in the use of public healthcare services, from 16.2 million doctor visits per year in 2006 to 43.9 million doctor visits per year in 2014 (National Secretariat of Planning and Development 2015). The increase in accessibility to health care has been mirrored by an increase in healthcare workers, with the number of nurses increasing from 6 320 to 16 931, and auxiliary nurses rising from to 13 229 to 18 256 from 2004 to 2006 (National Institute of Statistics 2016). The potential benefit to the public from these efforts is likely to be profound.

Binding between CAMs is usually of very low affinity, but due to the highly multimeric nature of cell‚Äìcell adhesion, sufficient avidity can be achieved to allow detection of the interaction between cells. The weakness of CAM interactions is illustrated by the difficulties in detecting binding of purified, monomeric forms of CAMs. This difficulty arises because binding assays require separation and washing steps, during which time weakly interacting molecules dissociate 42. This phenomenon may explain our observation that binding of Opa variants to soluble CD66b N-domain mutants required more CD66e-derived residues than binding to cell surface CD66 receptors. If each mutation introduced into CD66b enhances binding affinity between Opa and CD66b, as suggested by our infection assay data, then the threshold level of affinity necessary for detection will be reached sooner for the infection assay than for binding in solution. Alternatively, the level of multimerization may be important for Opa‚ÄìCD66 binding, as has been shown for the binding of IgSF member intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) to its receptor LFA-1. Recombinant ICAM-1 exists as monomers in solution, and direct binding to LFA-1 has been impossible to detect. Only when ICAM-1 was modified to induce dimerization could LFA-1 binding be detected 43
44. CD66 family members can exist as dimers in the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells 45, and recombinant CD66e N-domains have been shown to form oligomers in solution 46. Receptor dimers will more likely be found on the surface of cells, where the receptor concentration is higher than in solution. Thus, if Opa binding requires a receptor dimer, one would expect Opa variants to bind more readily to receptor-expressing cells than to soluble receptors. Another possible explanation for the discrepancy between the two binding detection methods is that in the solution assay the receptor binding domain exists as an unglycosylated, single domain, while in the infection assay the binding domain is presented in the context of a complete, glycosylated molecule. Although Opa binding does not require carbohydrate 18, the presence of sugar moieties may influence the strength of adhesion, as has been observed for the interaction between CD2 and CD58. Human CD2 has a single carbohydrate addition site in its Ig variable‚Äìlike N-domain that is absolutely required for binding to its normal ligand, CD58. Evidence from solution structure of this carbohydrate chain in relation to the GFC binding face indicates that the glycan is not itself situated in the binding face but is required to balance an unfavorable negative charge in order to maintain an active binding configuration 47. In fact, CD66 N-domains contain a potential glycosylation site at residue 70 (Fig. 1), which corresponds exactly to the structural position of the glycosylation site affecting ligand binding ability of human CD2 41. Mutation of this site in CD66e influences CD66e homophilic interactions, which are based on protein‚Äìprotein interactions, indicating that in CD66e also the degree of glycosylation can influence binding events mediated through CD66 protein sequences 41. Our data stress the importance of evaluating binding events in different assays, since differences between assays can reveal further details of the molecular interaction between ligands. Regardless of the molecular basis for the observed discrepancy, both assays show clearly that OpaC binding requires more CD66e-derived residues than OpaB or OpaI, which may indicate that OpaC binding of the receptor is of lower affinity than binding of OpaB or OpaI.",10.908234304719308,8.542443948275444

For example, TAM in hypoxic zones of solid tumors may express Arg1, a marker of M2 phenotype, but this phenomenon is not found in areas near functional vasculature 77. The high expression of Arg1 in hypoxic zones is related to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 and HIF-2, which regulate the suppressive capabilities of TAM and contribute to the TAM recruitment in models of inflammatory hepatocellular and colon carcinoma78, 79. Similarly, cytokines secreted by tumor-infiltrating leukocytes in the microenvironment play a pivotal role in the polarization of TAM. For instance, IL-4/IL-13 secreted by tumor-infiltrating Th2 CD4+ T cells contributes to the formation of M2 phenotype. In addition, the intracellular molecules, such as high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), can migrate to the outer space of TAM, bind to the TLRs, and promote the transformation of a pro-inflammatory phenotype in the development of tumors 80.",10.705183712047347,6.894987416854205

Previous data showed an M1-like role for TAM in the initiation and promotion of tumors with the activation of NF-Œ∫B signal pathway 71. In liver tumors, macrophages (known as Kupffer cells) engulf and kill circulating tumor cells in an M1-like manner, and the depletion of Kupffer cells in rats enhances metastasis 72. However, TAM is transformed into M2-like phenotype in the development of tumors, and NF-Œ∫B signal pathway is down-regulated 73. During the stage of invasion and migration, TAM is converted into M2 phenotype upon the stimulation of IL-4 secreted by CD4+ T cells and tumor cells, and functions as the key to the gate of invasion of tumor cells 74. Mechanistically, TAM migrates and synthesizes epidermal growth factor (EGF) under the stimulation of colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 secreted by tumor cells, in turn activating the migration of tumor cells 75. More interestingly, TAM and tumor cells migrate in lock-step, and both migration and chemotaxis of them could be inhibited by either the EGF or CSF-1 signaling pathways 64. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and matrix metalloproteinases 9 secreted by TAM could impair the matrix, and help tumor cells escape from the basement membrane, which is another important regulator of invasion of tumor cells 76. In a word, the distinct phenotypes of macrophages regulate the activity of tumor cells in the different stages of tumors, which provide an attractive target for the treatment in the future.",10.72532797371127,6.144401122929376

In addition, without government supplements many families would be unable to make ends meet even assuming that the breadwinners work part time.

As a result, if EID vaccine candidates are to be developed, continued private-public cooperation will be imperative, and novel approaches to engage and attract capital will be needed. While bond markets are capable of providing access to substantial amounts of capital to help vaccine development efforts, the resources available to the public sector have great potential as well (43) . In 2015, the U.S. spent $9,990 per person on healthcare (44) . If we assume that there are 300 million Americans, just 1.25% of this amount of spending would yield $37.46 billion dollars, greater than the projected $35.25 billion it would take to fund the entire EID portfolio of vaccines. While achieving such an allocation of funding would hardly be as simple as this calculation suggests, this thought experiment illustrates that encouraging the development of vaccines that protect against EIDs of pandemic potential is well within the means of the global public and private sector stakeholders, if there is public support and political will.

In a guarantee structure, a government agency promises to absorb the initial losses on the portfolio to a predetermined amount, shielding private-sector investors from substantial negative returns. For example, a guarantee on 50% of the portfolio's principal improves the expected annualized return in the base case scenario from ‚àí61.1% to ‚àí12.6% (see Table S11 in the Supplementary Materials). While this negative-expectedreturn scenario is still unlikely to attract investors, expected returns can be further increased using mechanisms such as advance market commitments and priority review vouchers. The guarantee structure-in combination with other existing revenue-boosting mechanismshas the potential to transform a financially unattractive portfolio of EID vaccine candidates into one that could realistically attract private-sector capital. Finally, we consider a subscription model under which the largest governments around the world would purchase subscriptions to EID vaccines on behalf of their constituents. To fund the cost of pursuing 141 vaccine targets at $250 million per target (for a total of $35.25 billion), suppose that the governments of the G7 countries agreed to pay a fixed subscription fee per capita over a fixed amortization period to cover this cost. How much would this subscription fee be? For an amortization period of 5 years, and an estimated total G7 population of 770,063,285 (as of 2016, according to the World Bank (31)), and a cost of capital of 10%, the per capita annual payment to cover the total cost of $35.25 billion is $12.08 per person per year. If we extend the amortization period to 10 years, the subscription fee declines to $7.45 per person per year. Table 4 contains the per capital subscription fees as a percentage of the annual per capita healthcare expenditure of each G7 country and as expected, the cost is trivial for all countries, ranging from a high of 0.59% for Italy to a low of 0.15% for the US using a 5-year amortization period.",17.051947043924123,6.574504270956919
