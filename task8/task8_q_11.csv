These include reducing social contacts by closing schools or postponing public events, and encouraging hand washing and the use of masks. These interventions will not only have a non-intuitive impact on the epidemic dynamics, but they will also have direct and indirect social and economic costs, which mean that governments will only want to use them for a limited amount of time. We use simulations to show that limitedtime interventions that achieve one aim, e.g., contain the total number of cases below some maximum number of treatments available, are not the same as those that achieve another, e.g., minimize peak demand for health care services. If multiple aims are defined simultaneously, we often see that the optimal intervention need not commence immediately but can begin a few weeks into the epidemic. Our research demonstrates the importance of tailoring pandemic plans to defined policy targets with some flexibility to allow for uncertainty in the characteristics of the pandemic.",16.616798811453847,10.079497075730954

Specifically, frequent exposure to both traditional media and new media can directly promote their ownership of public health supplies behavior. Although the direct effects of the relationship between media exposure and their cooperation behaviors was not significant, knowledge and trust in government mediated the relationship between media exposure and cooperation behaviors. Although different opinions exist related to the effect of media exposure on trust in government, the media malaise thesis indicates that mass media has an adverse effect on trust [40] , while the mobilization thesis contends that mass media has a positive effect on trust [41] , and the neutral thesis suggests that the relationship between media exposure and political trust is highly dependent on existing conditions [42] . Regardless of which research articles prevail, in the Chinese context, media is always a significant way to strengthen political trust; this positive effect has been empirically verified in our study and other academic research [43] . However, in the cross-scenario analysis, we found that trust in government can play roles in the relationship between media exposure and cooperation behaviors, while it did not play roles in the relationship between media exposure and supplies behaviors. Moreover, new media exposure does not have direct effects on trust in government in the NME-COOP scenario, which means that simple media exposure may not increase individuals' trust in government, but needs to through the growth in knowledge. Therefore, through the effective combination of new and traditional media platforms, various forms of public safety contents for distributing knowledge of public health emergencies, public health emergency management, and government activities and events should be communicated to the public in a seamless, comprehensive, and real-time manner in order to improve their trust in government.",14.617058323735534,5.980994634250888

The RV RNA concentration in both NP swabs was low,~2-4x10 2 copies/ml of the swab sample. Virus culture using 0.5 ml of both samples (~100 RV RNA molecules/flask) was unsuccessful most probably due to the low number of infectious particles in the sample. The ratio of foci forming units (ffu) per RV genome was previously determined to be about 1/40 in both RA27/3 and wtRV-infected cell cultures [21] and was lower in clinical samples.

The policy is still however highly debated because of controversial evidence. Moreover, the specific mechanisms leading to mitigation are not clearly identified. Methods: We introduced a stochastic spatial age-specific metapopulation model to assess the role of holiday-associated behavioral changes and how they affect seasonal influenza dynamics. The model is applied to Belgium, parameterized with country-specific data on social mixing and travel, and calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. It includes behavioral changes occurring during weekend vs. weekday, and holiday vs. school-term. Several experimental scenarios are explored to identify the relevant social and behavioral mechanisms. Results: Stochastic numerical simulations show that holidays considerably delay the peak of the season and mitigate its impact. Changes in mixing patterns are responsible for the observed effects, whereas changes in travel behavior do not alter the epidemic. Weekends are important in slowing down the season by periodically dampening transmission. Christmas holidays have the largest impact on the epidemic, however later school breaks may help in reducing the epidemic size, stressing the importance of considering the full calendar. An extension of the Christmas holiday of 1 week may further mitigate the epidemic. Conclusion: Changes in the way individuals establish contacts during holidays are the key ingredient explaining the mitigating effect of regular school closure. Our findings highlight the need to quantify these changes in different demographic and epidemic contexts in order to provide accurate and reliable evaluations of closure effectiveness.

The steps of the system are automated which reduces operator work-load and error. The process is rapid: the time lag between one step of the chemistry and the next is measured in seconds. The physical separation of reagents between the fitment and the blisters also enables a hot start for both the first and second stage PCRs (see Methods). This eliminates the expense and inefficiency associated with using chemical or biochemical means of inhibiting Taq. A physical hot start also has the additional, unique, advantage that the reverse transcriptase is prevented from interacting with primers below the desired temperature of the reaction. This minimizes the formation of primer dimers or other nonspecific products in the deep multiplex of the first stage PCR. The FilmArray lab-in-a-pouch is also an efficient solution to the ''sample to assay'' problem that many microfluidics systems must solve [80, 81, 82] . Typically, for low abundance pathogens, sensitivity comes from testing a large input sample volume. However, for multiplex testing, sample will often be limiting and to keep reagents costs down, the many individual tests must be done in small volumes.

Mass media reports on an epidemic or pandemic can provide important information to the public, and in turn, can induce positive healthy behaviour practices (i.e., handwashing, social distancing) in the individuals, that will reduce the probability of contracting the disease. Mass media fatigue, however, can dampen these effects. Mathematical models can be used to study the effects of mass media reports on epidemic/ pandemic outcomes. In this study we employ a stochastic agent based model to provide a quantification of mass media reports on the variability in important public health measurements.

Although there are some differences in the length of gestation, placental structure, and fetal development between humans and animal models, many structural and functional parallels exist, [94] [95] [96] which serve as tractable platforms for evaluating the safety and efficacy of various therapies during pregnancy. Similar to humans, pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have a hemochorial placenta, and their relatively short gestation and large litters are advantageous for performing high throughput screening of candidate therapeutics for safety and efficacy. Preclinical behavioral testing of rodent offspring has proven to be a promising avenue for identifying and predicting adverse effects associated with prenatal drug exposure in children. 97 Both rodent and rabbit models have been instrumental in testing teratogenic effects of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treating malaria in pregnant women. These studies concluded that drug-related teratogenic effects are limited to the first trimester, which supports the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that artemisinin may be administered only during the second or third trimester in pregnant women. 98, 99 One limitation of mouse and rat models, however, is their inability to recapitulate certain elements of human congenital disease. For instance, because murine CMV is not transmitted vertically as it is in humans, other animal models, including guinea pigs and nonhuman primates, are required for studying this aspect of disease pathogenesis. Studies in pregnant nonhuman primates have been instrumental for the identification of CD4 + T cell responses as critical for early control of CMV infection and transmission during pregnancy, 100 and studies in guinea pigs have demonstrated that a single-cycle infectious CMV vaccine induces immune responses similar to natural infection and protects against congenital infection. 101 Guinea pigs are also a useful model of chlamydial genital infection in humans. Experimental venereal infection with Chlamydophila caviae mimics disease associated with C. trachomatis in humans, including both sexual and perinatal transmission. Guinea pigs have therefore served as a useful model for testing candidate vaccines and treatments. 102 Rabbits continue to serve as an important model of venereal infection with Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, which is associated with congenital disease in humans. While natural infection in rabbits is associated with the species-specific T. paraluiscanuculi, rabbits can be experimentally inoculated with human T. pallidum, and have been instrumental in testing the efficacy of candidate vaccines. 103 Many mammalian species, including rodents, 104 ruminants, 105 and nonhuman primates, 40, 106 are susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and demonstrate similar fetal complications when infection occurs during pregnancy. Studies in various animal models have uniquely contributed to our understanding of placental listeriosis and serve as a platform for evaluating prevention strategies. 107, 108 Finally, mice, 85 cotton rats, 86 guinea pigs, 88 and sheep 87 are all susceptible to infection with RSV, and vaccination of pregnant animals has facilitated the development and testing of maternal immunization strategies for protecting against neonatal RSV. Based on preliminary studies in guinea pigs, 88 an experimental RSV recombinant F nanoparticle vaccine is now being evaluated in third-trimester pregnant women (Clintrials.gov, NCT02247726).",15.629896364147655,7.992667667604801

Speculations remain about the bat antiviral response and the advantages of co-existing with some of these viruses. Could infection with these viruses prime bat antiviral responses against pathogens that do kill bats, such as Tacaribe virus and rabies virus (145, 146) ? Experimental rabies virus infection studies in bats have led to conflicting conclusions about the nature of disease, ranging from asymptomatic infections to fatal meningitis (146) (147) (148) . Perhaps different strains of rabies virus, the infectious dose and the route of exposure have varying effects on the outcome of infection in different bat species. Currently, the literature is biased toward studying viruses that do not cause visible signs of disease in bats. Indeed, there is a need to study viruses that cause disease in bats and associated immunological consequences in these bats. Bats can remain infected with multiple zoonotic viruses in the wild (22) , the role of co-infection in modulating immune responses in bats needs to be investigated.

For example, areas requiring coordination across both of these core capacities, such as case management or infection control, were not well-documented. Taking a holistic approach to IHR (2005) core capacity development could avoid these issues. 26, 45, 52 Moreover, there were cases in which it was difficult to implement national IHR (2005) policies. For example, in the United Republic of Tanzania protocols for isolating patients with certain diseases were developed, but due to shortages of public-sector health facilities private sector hospitals had to be used during epidemics. 27 This highlights the need to adapt global core capacities requirements to locally appropriate policies and solutions. 3 .

The age-matching of the mink kits unfortunately resulted in some of the kits being pooled into the same tube. This left only 17 pooled samples, instead of 20, from Table 1 Histological criteria for assessing sections from duodenum, jejunum and aboral colon of mink kits kits without PWD. From the diarrheic kits, the samples were cultured individually. The swabs were stored at 5 °C until analysis by blinded cultivation. The swabs were inoculated on blood agar plates enriched with 5% bovine blood (blood agar base, Oxoid, Thermo Scientific, Watham, MA, USA) and incubated at 37 °C aerobically for 1-2 days. The two most frequently occurring bacterial colonies were then sub-cultivated before they were identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-Of-Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) using a VITEK MS MALDI-TOF (BioMérieux, Marcyl'Etoile, France) as previously described [25] . If two bacterial species were equally frequent next to a single more frequent species both were sub-cultivated, and hence three isolates were identified.",11.978818567591057,4.560899063149096

We observe that contaminants emitted from window seat positions (Figure 4 , seats L and A) enter the outlet ventilation much faster than those emitted from other seats. It is possible that the flow from the window seats may be too transient for a ceilingmounted collector above the central seats to aggregate enough particles to achieve reliable identification from those passenger seated in L or A. To mitigate this relatively low sampling rate, the collector may require a high inflow rate. Further, this suggests that a collector's effectiveness may increase when the collector is placed at the outlet vent near the window seat position. This may not be the most appropriate sensor location for collecting non-windowseat emissions, because the contaminant concentration becomes substantially diluted by the time it reaches the outlet, as shown by the second y-axis in Figure 5B .",12.298507347178436,9.828065310980072

The Spring Festival in 2020 is much earlier than in previous years. At this time, the possibility of human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus had just been discovered. When the Wuhan Municipal Government decided on 23 January 2020 to ""close the city"" to control the outflow of population, more than 5 million people had already left Wuhan on the Spring Festival holiday, and it was too late to control the entire potentially infected population in the epidemic area. At present, China's high-speed railway and expressway transportation network has experienced great development. This fast and convenient transportation has led to a floating population that can leave the source area to quickly reach every part of the country, which makes it very difficult to quarantine the floating population leaving the source area through transportation stations.

Patients with bronchiectasis can be classified into two groups: those with cystic fibrosis and those without cystic fibrosis. Individuals with either cystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis (CFRB) or noncystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis (NCFRB) experience continuous airway inflammation and suffer airway architectural changes that foster the acquisition of a unique polymicrobial community. The presence of microorganisms increases airway inflammation, triggers pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), reduces quality of life (QOL), and, in some cases, is an independent risk factor for increased mortality. As there is no cure for either condition, prevention and control of infection is paramount.

Metagenomics was able to accurately detect the known viral pathogen in 86% of specimens and from undiagnosed specimens, metagenomics agreed with the respiratory virus panel in 93% of specimens. Additionally, 12 viruses were detected via sequencing that were not detected with the panel. This result is either due to the panel not targeting those viruses or divergent/variant genome sequences. Lastly, the authors reported that partial or full-length viral genomes were recovered in 86% of respiratory viruspositive samples thus extending analysis to determine antiviral resistance, subtyping and phylogenetic assessments. Similarly, Yang et al. [69] reported agreement in results, particularly the detection of known respiratory viral pathogens, between shotgun metagenomics and PCR in 15 of 16 specimens.

This study included a cohort of 22 hematopoietic cellular transplant recipients with acute respiratory illness who underwent both bronchoscopy and BAL. Standard microbiological testing was performed including quantitative cultures, PCR and other diagnostic assays.

Further, shotgun metagenomics also detected known respiratory pathogens in 6 patients with negative microbiological testing including human coronavirus 229E and human rhinovirus A. Interestingly, while common causes of CAP these viruses are not included on many respiratory viral PCR panels. Streptococcus mitis and Corynebacterium propinquum, both virulent pathogens were detectable in one patient. Several DNA viruses were also identified and analyses of cDNA shotgun metagenomics sequencing provided evidence of active replication for some.

Preventive performance in finding true positives (i.e., PPV of quarantine combined with rapid diagnostic testing) appeared not to be very sensitive to the length of quarantine (for t > 2 days). This result suggests that if diagnostic test kit supplies are plentiful, then testing should be done early in quarantine. But if a test kit sparing approach is used (i.e., avoiding testing of those who become symptomatic) then there is not much benefit in delaying testing until after day 2 in quarantine. A test with both high sensitivity and high specificity would also allow for better use of resources if the travellers who tested negative are released into the community. Since PPV is mainly determined by prevalence at the source, it should be noted that an exit screening process at the source lowers the prevalence as well as PPV. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of quarantine itself is independent of the prevalence, and moreover, lower prevalence among incoming individuals yields a higher chance of extinction (or greater ripple effect of quarantine (Figures 4 and 5) ). NPV of quarantine combined with diagnostic testing would be extremely high with quarantine periods for lengths of 3 days or longer, supporting our suggestion to release quarantined individuals testing negative to the rapid diagnostic test into the community (if there was high confidence in test performance parameters for the emergent pandemic strain). In light of our findings, island countries may consider including influenza testing capacity and test kit stockpiles in their pandemic plans. The use of rapid diagnostic tests, if available through stockpiling in advance or rapid delivery after pandemic emergence, may permit more effective border control, with more efficient use of isolation facilities and shortening of the quarantine period.",14.256385602233854,7.646728576409137

Recent models built on data from the 1918 flu pandemic predict that 50 million-80 million people could die and the overwhelming majority of deaths are likely to occur in the developing countries. Unfortunately, total global capacity for flu vaccine manufacture in the first 12 months is estimated at only 500 million doses. Moreover, flu vaccine production faces many constraints: the vaccine is cultured in eggs and this is a lengthy process which cannot be speeded up [20] . Fortunately, alternative sources of virus culture cells are being investigated. With avian flu affecting poultry and eggs, the egg supply required for vaccine production may itself be disrupted. Intellectual property rights and liability from adverse effects from vaccines are other issues that impede manufacturers from increasing vaccine production. It should also be noted that if the influenza pandemic strain turns out not to be the H5N1 variety, then the stockpiled vaccines would be useless and wasted. Deciding who to vaccinate is another challenge. Currently, influenza vaccination is recommended to the elderly and those with medical conditions which put them at higher risk for hospitalization and death if they become infected with influenza. However, some critics have argued that younger and healthier individuals should be given priority because they are more mobile than older, less healthy people and are therefore more likely to spread the flu to others. Another factor in favour of giving priority to younger people is that the seasonal flu vaccine produces a weaker immune response in the elderly. Moreover, if the flu pandemic has characteristics of the 1918-1919 pandemic, then the young and healthy are at higher risk of death. Even if supplies were adequate for all age groups, mass immunization for a potential pandemic still has its risks. In 1976, four US soldiers developed swine flu in an army camp and there was concern that it could become a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu. Although some health officials expressed doubts about the likelihood of an epidemic, the government initiated a mass inoculation programme for the entire US population. After hundreds of people receiving the vaccine came down with Guillian-Barre syndrome, the US government terminated the campaign and indemnified manufacturers, ultimately paying $93 million in claims [21] .",12.403544994002385,6.735930874081483

Some targets underwent additional confirmatory testing, as described below. 10 • Klebsiella pneumoniae: Positive results were considered invalid because of poor assay specificity. 17 • Moraxella catarrhalis: This target was summarized in the descriptive NP/OP PCR analyses but excluded from aetiology analyses due to poor specificity (odds ratio significantly less than 1.0) and inability to determine a density threshold that improved specificity such that is was positively associated with case status. 12 M. catarrhalis is a commensal bacterium that can cause pneumonia but was observed more commonly among controls than among cases. There is some evidence in the literature that presence in the NP/OP may be protective against developing pneumonia. The hypothesized biological rationale is that if the child's microbiome is slanted more toward colonization of M. catarrhalis, it may out compete other more pathogenic organisms. 18 Because the underlying assumption of the analytic model is that what is measured in the NP is a signal of what is in the lung, the statistically significantly higher rate in controls who do not have pneumonia is in direct conflict with this assumption. Therefore, these NP/OP data do not provide useful diagnostic evidence of pneumonia etiology and so are not used. • Legionella species: Samples positive for Legionella species underwent confirmatory PCR testing using a different extraction method due to contamination of the original extraction reagents. Only one positive remained following confirmatory testing. Although there was only one positive, since we systematically tested for Legionella species and it is thought to be a potential cause of paediatric pneumonia, it was included as a possible cause in the aetiology analysis; this was handled consistently across all sites, including those where no Legionella species positives were detected. Quantitative PCR density thresholds were applied to NP/OP for pathogens with poor specificity (i.e., odds ratio <1) where a threshold that improved distinction between cases and controls could be identified: pneumococcus, H. influenzae, cytomegalovirus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii by NP/OP. [11] [12] [13] Measles was not systematically tested for in the PERCH study. Of all PERCH study enrolled cases, 33 cases were identified who met the PERCH study clinical criteria for measles testing (history of measles in past month, measles rash, measles admission diagnosis, measles discharge diagnosis); the NP/OP swabs from these 33 cases were tested for measles. Of the 33 suspected measles cases, 4 (12.1%) tested positive (Kenya n=2; Mali n=2; all had either an admission or discharge diagnosis of measles), none of whom had a positive CXR. Since measles was not systematically tested for, we elected to remove this as a potential cause in the aetiology analysis and simply describe the number of positives identified in the PERCH study. These four cases were excluded from the aetiology analyses and population aetiology distributions.",13.053617842312045,6.660319444100445

We used a flocked mid-turbinate nasal swab, instead of a flocked nasopharyngeal swab, for several reasons. First, our study was done in an outpatient setting, where nasopharyngeal sampling for respiratory viruses does not routinely occur. In addition, previous research among adults has shown that flocked nasal mid-turbinate swabs are as sensitive for respiratory virus testing as flocked nasopharyngeal swabs, and since nasal mid-turbinate swabs are more comfortable and acceptable for patients, these swabs are preferred for sample collection in outpatient studies [5] . There is also comparable sampling capacity between flocked nasopharyngeal and flocked mid-turbinate nasal swabs in terms of cell counts and levels of beta-actin, a measure of sampling adequacy [6] . Finally, nasal swabs are routinely used for the purpose of respiratory viral surveillance (the focus of our study), such as in the community setting for influenza. In terms of sample size, we specified a priori an absolute incremental benefit of 10 % for viral detection (i.e., 10 extra virus-positive samples detected by only the throat swab per 100 patients) to be significant for the purpose of respiratory viral surveillance. To show this level of effect, we required 77 patients, assuming a two-sided test, α = 0.05 and power of 80 %.

Influenza poses a serious public health threat around the world, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Fortunately, vaccination can mitigate the negative effects of this common infectious disease. Although inoculating frontline health care workers (HCWs) helps minimize disease transmission, some HCWs continue to resist participating in voluntary immunization programs. A potential solution to this problem is government-mandated vaccination for HCWs; however, in practice, there are substantial barriers to the adoption of such policies. The purpose of this paper is to identify the likelihood of adopting a policy for mandatory immunization of HCWs in Ontario based on a historical review of barriers to the agenda setting process. Methods: Documents from secondary data sources were analysed using Kingdon's agenda setting framework of three converging streams leading to windows of opportunity for possible policy adoption. Results: The problems, politics, and policies streams of Kingdon's framework have converged and diverged repeatedly over an extended period (policy windows have opened and closed several times). In each instance, a technically feasible solution was available. However, despite the evidence supporting the value of HCW immunization, alignment of the three agenda setting streams occurred for very short periods of time, during which, opposition lobby groups reacted, making the proposed solution less politically acceptable. Conclusions: Prior to the adoption of any new policies, issues must reach a government's decision agenda. Based on Kingdon's agenda setting framework, this only occurs when there is alignment of the problems, politics, and policies streams. Understanding this process makes it easier to predict the likelihood of a policy being adopted, and ultimately implemented. Such learning may be applied to policy issues in other jurisdictions. In the case of mandatory influenza vaccinations for HCWs in Ontario, it seems highly unlikely that a new policy will be adopted until perception of the problem's importance is sufficient to overcome the political opposition to implementing a solution and thus, create a window of opportunity that is open long enough to support change.",12.662780611436283,6.677372075172514

Timely reporting on the detection and serotyping status of DENV in mosquito can serve as an alert to people who fall ill to consider the possibility of dengue infection and seek medical assistant in time, and to initiate timely community and vector control programs to help mitigate the spread of DENV infection. In this study, tests with clinical serum samples showed that the four singleplex serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents had clinical performance comparable to that of the reference qRT-PCR for the detection of their target serotypes in human serum. There was one qRT-PCR-positive/RT-iiPCR-negative sample for DENV-2 and qRT-PCR-negative/RT-iiPCR-positive for DENV-3. The discrepancy in detection between the two assays was likely due to low viral loads in these samples; one supporting observation was that the one qRT-PCR-positive/RT-iiPCR-negative sample had a Ct of 44.49 in qRT-PCR. The four index reagents offered excellent analytical sensitivity and specificity to detect their target DENV serotypes in human serum on the compact field-deployable POCKIT device, and also had great analytical specificity in mosquito samples on the hand-held POCKIT Micro Plus.",13.521657877637477,9.971141494031485

Nonetheless, further evaluation of its performance in clinical samples derived from infected patients is warranted. In contrast to the RT-qPCR assays, the RT-iiPCR assay is fully deployable under field conditions and, thus, can be used as a PON assay in remote, resource-deprived areas to provide rapid results (~1.5 h turnaround time from sample to result) at relatively low costs (< 10 USD per RT-iiPCR test vs. ≥ 20 USD per RT-qPCR test) and with the use of reagents that are stable at room temperature for two years without compromising the assay's performance. Therefore, the ZIKV RT-iiPCR could provide a highly effective PON assay that would enhance disease management, screening of blood bank supplies, and viral surveillance in human or insect populations with an improvement of the quality of the health care system of major significance particularly in remote or low-infrastructure areas within developing countries.

Though we assume that all mass gatherings could increase the transmission of respiratory diseases, this may not be the case for diseases transmitted through infectious droplets where the probability of close and adequate contact (i.e., < 6 feet for influenza) with an infectious person may be too low for efficient transmission [49] . Even at large mass gatherings involving out-of-town visitors such as the May 2009 convocation speech in Arizona (during which no respiratory disease outbreaks were detected) [37] , most participants likely stayed at hotels or at other low-density accommodations rather than in cabins or at campgrounds [5, 49] . In addition, many of these gatherings have well organized and pre-assigned seating. This could further reduce the 'crowdedness' and likelihood of close and prolonged contact with infectious persons [5] .

Two high-throughput approaches -16S rRNA targeted-amplicon and shotgun metagenomicswere evaluated and compared to standard microbiological testing including culture. Results were concordant in 5 of 6 specimens between shotgun metagenomics and culture whereas results of only 2 specimens were consistent between the targeted-amplicon assay and culture. A more recent study compared the detection of respiratory viruspositive and undiagnosed nasopharyngeal swabs from pediatric patients between a shotgun metagenomics approach and an FDA-cleared respiratory virus panel (GenMark eSensor) [72] . Metagenomics was able to accurately detect the known viral pathogen in 86% of specimens and from undiagnosed specimens, metagenomics agreed with the respiratory virus panel in 93% of specimens. Additionally, 12 viruses were detected via sequencing that were not detected with the panel. This result is either due to the panel not targeting those viruses or divergent/variant genome sequences. Lastly, the authors reported that partial or full-length viral genomes were recovered in 86% of respiratory viruspositive samples thus extending analysis to determine antiviral resistance, subtyping and phylogenetic assessments. Similarly, Yang et al. [69] reported agreement in results, particularly the detection of known respiratory viral pathogens, between shotgun metagenomics and PCR in 15 of 16 specimens.

This study included a cohort of 22 hematopoietic cellular transplant recipients with acute respiratory illness who underwent both bronchoscopy and BAL. Standard microbiological testing was performed including quantitative cultures, PCR and other diagnostic assays.

Streptococcus mitis and Corynebacterium propinquum, both virulent pathogens were detectable in one patient.

These studies are delivering new targets of both viral and host origin for the development of diagnostic and surveillance assays, vaccines, and therapeutics (Figure 97.2) . From a corporate perspective, large populations of patients could benefit from any vaccine or therapeutic agent that becomes financially of interest to produce. True personalized treatment for single individuals will be more difficult to accomplish. Thus, identifying biomarkers, assays, and host-modifying treatments, that work for and/or against a broad spectrum of different viruses, are of utmost importance. Comparative studies into dynamics of infection with regard to viral diversity, evolution, and epidemiology, in combination with the molecular basis of the host response to infection and pathogenesis, may enable the rational design of multipotent biological response modifiers that will mitigate the effects of viral diseases.

This technology uses an NHS ester derivative to modify primary amino groups by linking a mass balance group (carbonyl group) and a reporter group (based on N-methylpiperazine) to proteolytic peptides via the formation of an amide bond [117] . Due to the isobaric mass design of the iTRAQ reagents, differentially labelled peptides appear as a single peak in MS scans, reducing the probability of peak overlapping. When iTRAQ-tagged peptides are subjected to MS/MS analysis, the mass balancing carbonyl moiety is released as a neutral fragment, liberating the isotope-encoded reporter ions which provides relative quantitative information on proteins. An inherent drawback of the reported iTRAQ technology is due to the enzymatic digestion of proteins prior to labelling, which artificially increases sample complexity and this approach needs a powerful multidimensional fractionation method of peptides before MS identification.",15.685924961004527,8.491890605133626

Not all assays are cleared by the FDA for use in the United States for all conditions and age ranges, and the current assays are not FDAcleared for oropharyngeal, rectal, or conjunctival specimens. However, many of these tests have been assessed for diagnosing infections in multiple extragenital anatomic sites in men, women, and children. Current CDC guidelines for laboratory-based detection of CT and NG recommend NAATs for oropharyngeal and rectal specimens and for use in evaluating cases of adult and pediatric sexual abuse. 141 However, use of these tests outside of the FDA-approved indications requires that laboratories establish the specifications for performance characteristics according to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations. Performance characteristics vary among assays (details are available in the package inserts), but some general comments can be made. The diagnostic sensitivity of the tests varies according to the specimen type and whether the patient is asymptomatic or symptomatic. Interpretation of the results of NA testing for CT can be challenging because many studies have shown these assays to be more diagnostically sensitive than culture, which was previously used as the gold standard for clinical trials. For men, the diagnostic sensitivity of testing urine specimens is nearly equivalent to that of testing urethral swabs. A limited volume (20e50 mL) of first-passed urine is preferred because larger volumes will lead to a decreased concentration of the organism in the sample and thus reduced diagnostic sensitivity. With proper specimen collection, male urethral swabs and urine specimens have a sensitivity of nearly 100% for the detection of NG or CT infection. For women, vaginal and cervical swab specimens provide the highest sensitivity for the detection of NG and CT infection, with many studies showing a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. Vaginal swabs are preferred because they are easier to collect. Urine specimens can be used, but they generally result in a lower diagnostic sensitivity than cervical swabs (75% e85%). An alternative to urine testing in women is the use of self-collected vaginal swabs, which have been shown in some studies to have a diagnostic sensitivity that is equal to that obtained with cervical swabs; several commercial tests have been cleared for use with vaginal swabs.",16.17654952463358,8.385858987469447

Persistent viral shedding may potentially allow for transmission after patients recover clinically [17] . Symptomatic passengers may use antipyretic agents to pass thermal screening undetected. The value of border screening in deterring travel by ill persons and in building public confidence is unsubstantiated. Also, the value of health alerts or other information leaflets and posters remains to be evaluated. Given that the 2009 hajj would take place at the end of November-during the pandemic wave in the Northern hemisphere-health authorities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia held consultations with the WHO to mitigate the effects of influenza [18, 19] .

For the most part, it is from these disciplines that economists and others learn about the pathways of infection and what can be done to prevent infections or to mitigate them once they have occurred. Mathematical epidemiology provides algebraic models of the dynamics of infectious diseases, the starting point for an economic theory of infectious diseases and their control. Even without endogenous behavior by utility-maximizing individuals, these models are nonlinear and dynamic, capable of exhibiting complicated even chaotic behavior.",15.090125394911677,6.878876762159555

A particular point we attempt to make lies with the importance of planning for categories of contingencies. It is a daunting task to attempt to plan for each and every possible contingency. However, contingencies can be grouped into categories and planned for accordingly. This allows for consistency in preparedness and best utilization of resources. Types of contingencies develop and change over time as societies and organizations change and progress. Prior to the 20th century, nuclear contamination was not a concern, but today countries with nuclear power generation capabilities have in place extensive contingency plans that are regularly tested. More common hazards such as severe weather and other natural events have caused enough damage to drive organizations to better preparedness. State and local governments along with private enterprises in states like California and Mississippi spend large sums of money to prepare to mitigate the effects of earthquakes and flooding. Contingency planning may not have been a traditional security process, but in today's global business environment the security organization is assuming a much greater role and responsibility for its implementation. Even prior to the events of September 11, 2001, many organizations were becoming more conscious of the need to have contingency plans.

This leads to either late detection or no detection at all of a seasonal surge or an influenza outbreak. • Countries do not have a consistent or systematic sampling strategy for collecting clinical samples from SARI and ILI cases and testing for influenza virus. As a result, influenza cases and the disease burden associated with influenza are underestimated in many countries. • A lag time often exists between data collection and influenza testing, or influenza testing and sharing of the test results for public reporting, as well as sharing influenza virus specimens for vaccine strain selection. This results in poor understanding of the types of influenza virus circulating in real time and also increases the probability of vaccine mismatch specific to the Region. • A standard protocol is lacking, including a validated algorithm for testing and diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viruses using multiplex respiratory assays where specimens are tested both for influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses. The absence or inadequacy of appropriate diagnostic facilities to define the viral etiology of severe pneumonia is a problem and means that many acute lower respiratory infections are undiagnosed and hence that viral pneumonia incidence rates are underestimated. • Annual projections of the requirements for reagents and consumable laboratory supplies for the detection and diagnosis of seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses based on a well-defined sampling strategy are often lacking. This can lead to stock outs in the middle of a busy influenza season. • Countries often do not use the data generated locally from their surveillance systems to define control policies and practices that can reduce the influenza disease burden in the general population. • Countries do not use the surveillance data to better understand the economic burden of influenza and often undervalue the role of control policies such as use of vaccines to reduce healthcare-associated severe influenza illness. • In countries where control policies exist and are implemented, such as the use of seasonal influenza vaccines, surveillance data are not used to monitor the effectiveness of these policies and interventions.",21.456583947100306,7.245468956287028

For a POC test to be useful in the clinic, it needs to go through the following procedures: i) sample collection, ii) sample processing, iii) testing and/or instrumentation, iv) results analysis and data report, v) interpretation and vi) waste disposal. These procedures do not form a barrier for implementing POC tests in RRS, as required laboratory infrastructure and logistics support are readily available. The multiple testing procedures, however, pose great technical challenges for POC testing in RLS, especially in rural areas, because of limited laboratory testing capability and lack of skilled operators. Further, insufficient logistical support in RLS forms the secondary barrier for POC testing. For example, there is no clean running water, or uninterrupted electricity supply in rural areas. When a clinical sample is collected, sample processing (e.g. centrifugation or nucleic acid extraction) and instrumentation for nucleic acid assays are required, but not feasible for POC testing because of cost constraints and lack of trained personnel. Some reagents need refrigeration for long-term stability, which is also challenging for POC testing in RLS. Another important technical challenge is safely disposing of biological waste, including used diagnostic devices and clinical samples. In RLS, waste disposal and biosafety are not as stringently regulated as RRS. Open air burning may be the only option for disposing clinical waste and medical devices. Some of the chemicals used in POC assays require special treatment before disposal (e.g. guanidinium thiocyanate). Therefore, technical challenges associated with technological complexity and logistical limitations in protein-, nucleic acid-and cell-based assays, need to be overcome, so that they can be widely used in RLS.",12.812335170225703,7.187316478213411

This approach appeared to work well for 6 weeks, suggesting that SARS could be prevented from entering the island. However, despite these measures, unrecognized transmission of SARS began occurring in the community. SARS in a hospital laundry worker at the large urban Ho Ping Hospital in Taipei led to exposure of staff and patients and ignited an explosive outbreak that spread to other hospitals and the community. To contain the transmission, patients, staff, and visitors were quarantined in the facility, an action that had rarely been invoked in modern times. More than 1,000 persons were quarantined; some tossed soft drink bottles from windows with protest messages, others communicated the disarray within the facility through cell phone messages, and a few escaped.

It can be triggered by ambient microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In this review, we examine the outcomes of asthma patients in relation to environmental exposures to ambient microbe products, focusing on whether exposure leads to asthma development from birth to childhood and if particular microbes are associated with worsened asthma exacerbations. Recent Findings Bacterial endotoxin is more prominent in homes with pets and may cause cytokine cascades that lead to asthma exacerbation. However, some studies have demonstrated a protective effect with early exposure. Patients with positive Aspergillus skin testing are more prone to moderate-severe or severe-uncontrolled asthma. Fungal sensitization is also associated with earlier onset of asthma and demonstrates a dose-dependent relationship of symptom severity and duration. Among viruses, rhinovirus has the greatest association with decreased lung function, severe asthma, and asthma-related hospital admissions. Distribution of microbial products and associated asthma symptoms depends on the geographical climate. Genetic variations among individuals also mitigate the effects of microbial products on asthma development and symptom severity. Summary Microbial products of bacteria, fungi, and viruses are associated with the development of asthma, more severe asthma symptoms, and worse outcomes. However, some early exposure studies have also demonstrated a protective effect. Bacterial and fungal products are related to decreased lung function and earlier onset of asthma. Viral products are related to asthma-associated hospital admissions; and the climate and patient genetics can also temper or intensify the relationships between microbial products, asthma development, and asthma symptom severity. Further research should focus on the effects of early microbe exposure and its interaction with human immune systems and asthma-related outcomes.",17.985596403297862,8.258680821146545

Many nurses believe the patients are not motivated to change their condition, and they do not believe they are effective in helping the patients achieve any behavioral change. Similarly, physicians have adverse opinions especially about the morbidly obese patients. The patients often view the health care community as biased against them, often disrespectful in the care they receive. 18 Thus, faced with a disaster setting of limited resources and perhaps with some patient care bias in managing obese patients, a transparent process of triaging resources must be developed. Several models have recently been proposed in triaging hospital or ICU resources for nontrauma patients, so-called tertiary triage. Most models focus on use of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Through the use of an intensivist-led multidisciplinary triage team, patients in need of advanced clinical resources are evaluated for inclusion and then exclusion criteria and followed up using the SOFA score to determine illness severity and course. Patients with predicted high mortality or failure to improve, in this model, would be supported with palliative care and have their resources reallocated to other patients with greater chance of survival. Important to note is that none of the models specifically target patient weight as a criterion in determining need or exclusion; what counts is the severity of the illness. 38, 39 SUMMARY Management of the morbidly obese patient under normal circumstances requires increased resources such as personnel, supplies, and special equipment. In the often Critical Care of the Morbidly Obese in Disasters resource-constrained setting of disasters, normal support to these patients may be jeopardized. In addition, their underlying condition with limited mobility and comorbidities may increase their likelihood of suffering harm depending on the type and tempo of the disaster. Morbidly obese patients are a special-needs population for whom necessary planning must be done to mitigate the effects of the disaster on them. Prior planning not only addresses appropriate care needs for these patients but also avoids crisis intervention during an event that might detract care and support from others during stressful times. In the end, such planning helps optimize the care for all.",13.18985745358222,6.860715194212533

While it sounds very appealing to place an mPOC influenza virus platform nearer to the patient in the ED or in urgent care, the initial investment to place and maintain that testing may be a daunting sell to administrators. The question around this ROI is where the cost avoidance is over the continuum of care. For patients coming through the ED during influenza season the greatest impact to patient management would be avoiding a hospital admission. The average cost of a hospital admission due to pneumonia is $14,143, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Rockville, MD) [48] . Compared to the cost of a Tamiflu prescription, which is roughly $100, the avoidance of hospital admission would clearly have the greatest financial impact. When one adds the implementation costs of the mPOC instrument and reagents over the course of a flu season, the ROI can become a more comprehensive sell to the C-suite or the corporation's senior executives. Tables 1 to 3 demonstrate the estimated cost of implementing an mPOC influenza assay in a hospital system with 14 medical centers, each with an ED. The total cost of implementation for instrument and reagents over 3 months of the respiratory disease season adds up to $420,00 ( Table 1 ). The number of admissions that would need to be avoided to break even on the cost of implementation is 30, or roughly 2 per ED ( Table 2 ). This number is equal to 0.5% of the estimated 6,000 tested patients over the course of the respiratory disease season, which would equate to an ROI of <3 months (Table 3) . Another factor to consider when thinking about a rapid mPOC test is that placing testing correctly in the system may actually be cost neutral, because testing is being shifted without the need to bring on any additional testing. Outcome studies looking at technology placement are forthcoming [9] .",11.88616554756695,6.132001798221537

The specimen load increased from 1 every 2 to 3 months to 2700 nasal swabs in 2 weeks and 3200 environmental specimens in 2 months. Staff increased from 2 to 75 persons and 6 tons of laboratory supplies were flown in from the CDC.

First, they are superior in analytical sensitivity and speed compared to the syndromic approaches they replaced, that is viral and bacterial cultures. Second, due to the fact that they emerged and were adopted quickly as a superior method to culture, adoption has outpaced evidence of clinical utility for some tests and populations [7] . Ideally, we would evaluate all of these approaches via randomized controlled trials comparing patient outcomes between conventional microbiologic testing and testing including a syndromic panel; however, very limited studies addressing this have been published [8] . Finally, there are also very limited studies on appropriate utilization.

The risk of infectious disease transmission during a mass gathering is the same or even more as the risk of transmission that prevails in any one of the home or host countries of mass gathering participants. During the world health Assembly 67, a side event took place to launch the lancet series on Mass Gathering Medicine in May 21, 2014 ( Figure 1 ). Mass-gatherings are held for various purposes including religious rituals, sports activities, or festivals and therefore the demographics, risks, and the intensity of activities vary. Further, the risks are exacerbated during mass gatherings such as the Hajj for airborne, droplet, and body fluid-related transmission due to the absence of social distancing among participants; increased susceptibility due to stress, lack of sleep, and changing nutritional factors during peak events; disruption of medications among persons with chronic debilitating diseases; and participation in some of the rituals such as animal sacrifices or the practice of scalp hair shaving practices by self-help groups using unsterile blades rather than in regulated barber shops. Given that two-thirds of the emerging diseases are zoonotic, human-animal interaction during some mass gatherings such as the Hajj further increases the risk, and Saudi Arabia imports sacrifice animals from 6 countries. Thus, except for vaccine preventable diseases, perfection of disease control strategies in one or few countries alone including in the host country may not offer blanket protection from all types of disease transmission dynamics for epidemic prone disease agents present in any one of the countries. The impact of these challenges on public health during mass gatherings can be minimized by two strategies. First, each of the countries that participate in a mass gathering should have alert systems in place to identify diseases of transmission-potential during a mass gathering, control measures in place to avoid the exportation of such risks, and reduce the participation of individuals at risk increased risk for disease acquisition. For GHSA 1 , this relates to adequate syndromic-and agent-based surveillance, laboratory enhancements, and reporting systems and risk communication managed by adequately trained workforce including one epidemiologist for a population of 200,000. Furthermore, countries participating in mass gatherings should have public emergency preparedness in response mode and adequate surge capacity to be able to respond to potential emergencies from participants returning from mass gatherings. Existence of a public health emergency operations center with sufficient pool of response manpower and medical countermeasures available will be critical. This can only be functional if relevant a national public health preparedness policies and authorities are in place to coordinate a response with diverse organizational entities such as the ministries of aviation, defense, interior, and health.",14.195960208615686,7.726444814298906

Mass spectrometry methods are being utilized in more routine clinical laboratories and can now be used for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Investigators are currently exploring methods to use mass spectrometry for strain typing and susceptibility testing, but there is more work to be done in this area, which has not yet been shown to have enough discriminatory power for use in patient care. PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is another technology that has large potential for the future of microbiological diagnostics. This is a method capable of identifying nearly all human pathogens of different types without requiring the establishment of a predesigned panel of candidate microbes for testing. This is a unique feature because most assays test for the presence of specific organisms. The method combines a PCR step with a mass spectrometry time-of-flight analyzer to identify the nucleic acid base composition of the PCR products produced in a multiplex PCR reaction. Resulting nucleotide sequence must be analyzed against a reference database of genomic sequences to identify the organisms present. This technology is primarily used for research, food testing, public health surveillance, or biopharmaceutical testing at this time and has not yet been adopted into the routine clinical microbiology laboratory.

[2] [3] Diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses is usually performed in hospital settings. Testing serves several functions, including facilitating patient cohorting, 4 initiation of antiviral therapy, 5 containment of nosocomial outbreaks, 6 and decreased use of ancillary testing [7] [8] and antibiotics. [8] [9] [10] In most cases, respiratory samples are collected by invasive methods such as nasopharyngeal swab or nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and diagnostics are performed using immunofluorescence and/or culture-based methods. 11 Increased sensitivity has been demonstrated with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), [12] [13] and the use of PCR diagnostics in hospitals has increased. 11 Diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses is also important for surveillance and epidemiologic studies performed in both hospital and community settings. Throughout the year, multiple respiratory viruses co-circulate and can cause similar clinical syndromes that cannot be distinguished without diagnostic testing. [14] [15] Recent studies of nonpharmaceutical interventions to prevent the spread of influenza have highlighted the need for large-scale, community-based epidemiologic data, including specific laboratoryconfirmed diagnosis. 16 PCR-based methods have enabled investigators to perform familybased studies of viral prevalence in the community. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Invasive respiratory sample collection methods for respiratory testing have significant limitations for community studies. 22 The performance of a nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab test is stressful, leading to reluctance among children and parents to participate in studies, particularly if repeated testing is required. Based on the higher sensitivity of PCR, we hypothesized that respiratory viruses could be detected from samples collected by noninvasive methods that might be more acceptable to children such as anterior nare swabs or facial tissues. While other studies have investigated the use of anterior nare swabs to collect samples for the detection of respiratory viruses, 23-28 studies investigating the use of facial tissues have not been published.",12.734510753492184,4.8263123078931205

Pigs for both animal experiments were obtained from an experimental herd. The original pigs from this facility were derived by caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) methodology and maintained in a HEPA-filtered barrier with irradiated pig feed and filtered, chlorinated, UV-treated water. All pigs derived from this population were raised in this facility by normal production methods. Sentinel pigs were euthanized monthly, and full diagnostic workups were conducted to ensure freedom of swine pathogens. In addition, if there were any unexpected clinical signs or mortality, these pigs were also euthanized and given a full diagnostic workup. Diagnostic monitoring included gross pathology, histopathology, serology, virus isolation, fecal float, electron microscopy, bacterial culture, select immunofluorescence testing and immunohistochemistry procedures, and select molecular diagnostic testing, including PCR. Many of the agents were screened by multiple procedures. Pathogens that the herd of origin was determined to be free of by diagnostic testing were as follows: Actinobacillus spp., Giardia spp., pseudora- Original pigs were derived from Large White ϫ Landrace females and boars that were F2s from Large White ϫ Landrace females and synthetic sire lines (PIC L24 and L26). Mating programs were designed to minimize inbreeding. Sows were bred by fresh artificial insemination, gestated in individual pens, and farrowed in traditional farrowing crates. At 24-to 28-day weaning, all pigs were moved to growth pens. Appropriate feed for pig ages was given. No antibiotics (feed, water, or injection) or vaccines were ever used in the 10-year period from facility derivation until the start of this study. The animals were moved from the source herd to the National Animal Disease Center, where they were housed in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) animal isolation facilities and cared for in compliance within the guidelines of the National Animal Disease Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Nasal swabs were taken from each pig the day that both animal experiments began and were negative for H. parasuis by culture. Experiment 1 design. Twenty-five pigs from 4 litters were distributed into 5 groups of 5 pigs such that each group contained 1 pig each from 3 of the litters (one each that was 36, 53, or 68 days old) and 2 pigs each from the fourth litter (48 days old). One group each was challenged intranasally with 1 of the 4 isolates of H. parasuis (29755, 12939, MN-H, and SW114) or sham inoculated with PBS. Cultured dilutions indicated that the inocula contained 10 8.31 CFU/ml (SW114), 10 8.68 CFU/ml (12939), 10 8.32 CFU/ml (29755), or 10 7.23 CFU/ml (MN-H). One week after challenge, nasal swabs were taken from all surviving pigs and one sham-inoculated pig was cohoused with each of the healthy survivors of the 29755 and MN-H groups. Three weeks after challenge, nasal swabs were taken from all surviving pigs and they were rechallenged intranasally with 10 8.83 CFU of H. parasuis isolate 12939. During the course of the experiment, pigs were examined for clinical signs approximately every 4 h, except for an 8-h overnight period, and any pig showing signs of Glässer's disease, such as joint swelling and lameness, incoordination, tremors, severe depression, or reluctance to move was immediately euthanized. Remaining pigs were euthanized 10 days after secondary challenge. At the time of euthanasia, swabs of nasal cavity, lung, joint, abdominal cavity, thoracic cavity, and meninges were collected and agitated in 1 ml of PBS, and 100 l of this was cultured on Casman's plates.

In a large multiyear review of admissions to a single center in Canada, multiplex viral testing was not associated with a reduction in antibiotic therapy or time spent in isolation rooms. 53 Similarly, in a review of 196 patients with a respiratory tract infection who had a viral pathogen identified by using quantitative real-time PCR, only 6% had antibiotic therapy stopped following viral testing, including 79 of 125 patients (63%) with normal chest imaging. 54 Finally, PCR testing in a cohort of elderly patients admitted with a respiratory infection failed to reduce antibiotic duration or hospital length of stay. 55 The utility of respiratory viral testing has been studied in several randomized trials. In a multicenter trial in the Netherlands, 107 newly admitted patients receiving antibiotics for an LRTI were randomized to receive standard care or viral testing according to multiplex PCR. 56 Although the use of PCR doubled the number of patients with an identified pathogen, it increased hospital costs without reducing antibiotic use, diagnostic procedures, or duration of hospital stay.

Major malformations such as pulmonary agenesis are incompatible with life and are often accompanied by malformations in other organs. When investigating congenital masses of lung-like tissue, key observations include the location of the lesion and whether it is contained within the pleura or not, the continuity of the trachea and primary bronchus with the bronchi within the mass, and the nature of the pulmonary and systemic arterial supplies. Pulmonary hypoplasia is defined as reduced lung weight; hypoplastic lungs usually also have reduced numbers of alveoli . In contrast, the airways generally develop normally. Pulmonary hypoplasia may accompany malformations in other organs, and may include anasarca. Its development is closely linked to the presence of lung liquid that is secreted by the pulmonary epithelium, fills the airspaces, and is required for growth of the lung mass. Pulmonary hyperplasia is the result of overdistension of the lung, resulting from tracheal obstruction or laryngeal paralysis. In contrast, pulmonary hypoplasia ensues if the lung volume is not maintained. Pulmonary hypoplasia is caused by conditions that compress the lung, including congenital diaphragmatic hernia, intrathoracic masses, pleural effusions, or malformations of the thoracic cage; by oligohydramnios, in which the reduced uterine volume causes abnormal fetal positioning that compresses the chest and lungs; by impaired fetal breathing movements from abnormalities of the fetal nervous or musculoskeletal systems; by a tracheal fistula; and perhaps by reduced fluid secretion as a result of fetal hypoxemia or high levels of epinephrine.",12.425888575237568,7.342654896768481

However, other isobaric labeling reagents are available that do not require this level of resolution for labs not possessing instrumentation with this capability. Isobaric labeling strategies provide several benefits including multiplexing of large cohorts to improve throughput; use of a reference channel for data normalization; and improved quantitation due to elimination of run-to-run variation and reduction in sample processing variability.

Therefore, specimens from sites such as lower respiratory tract (sputum), nasal sinuses, superficial wounds, fistulae, and others require care in collection. 4 . The laboratory requires a specimen, not a swab of a specimen. Actual tissue, aspirates, and fluids are always specimens of choice, especially from surgery. A swab is not the specimen of choice for many specimens because swabs pick up extraneous microbes, hold extremely small volumes of the specimen (0.05 mL), make it difficult to get bacteria or fungi away from the swab fibers and onto media, and the inoculum from the swab is often not uniform across several different agar plates. Swabs are expected from nasopharyngeal and viral respiratory infections. Flocked swabs have become a valuable tool for specimen collection and have been shown to be more effective than Dacron, rayon, and cotton swabs in many situations. The flocked nature of the swab allows for more efficient release of contents for evaluation. 5 . The laboratory must follow its procedure manual or face legal challenges. These manuals are usually supported by the literature. 6 . A specimen should be collected prior to administration of antibiotics. Once antibiotics have been started, the flora changes, leading to potentially misleading culture results. 7 .

Like Esposito et al, we used the recently introduced midturbinate nasal flocked swabs for sample collection. Unlike traditional swabs that are constructed by wrapping absorbent rayon fibers around a sturdy applicator, flocked swabs have no internal mattress core to entrap the sample. As a result, the entire sample stays close to the surface and elutes quickly and completely into testing media. Both swabs have a similar diameter. Recent studies have indicated that midturbinate nasal flocked swabs have high sensitivity and specificity for detection of common respiratory viruses by direct immunofluorescent antibody and molecular assays compared with nasopharyngeal swabs, while only being inserted to half the depth. 14,16-18 Thus, the midturbinate nasal flocked swabs provide a less invasive yet sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and are more amenable to patient self-collection.

The evidence from the 2003 UK White Paper suggests, for example, that the reductions in airline costs and fares created by the low-cost model are ''sufficient to offset the fall in demand expected from the impact of any economic instruments'' such as a fuel tax which would help fulfil the ''commitment for aviation to pay for its environmental impacts'' (DfT, 2003, p. 150) . Although this is essentially an argument for non-intervention by government, implicit in these remarks is the recognition that aviation should be linked in some way with the notion of demand management. As is the case throughout the EU, the UK government is not going to activate such a policy except in the negative sense of not providing sufficient airport capacity to accommodate growth. In sum, therefore, the axes linking globalization and liberalization in their triangular relationships to sustainability, which were already weak, have arguably been further diminished by the effects of 9/11 and its aftermath.

We sought to determine the burden and clinical/epidemiological characteristics of RSV hospitalization in young children in Amman, Jordan. We investigated risk factors for severity including vitamin D levels. Methods: We conducted viral surveillance with clinical and demographic data in children <2 years admitted with respiratory symptoms and/or fever at the Al-Bashir Government Hospital from March16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Nasal/throat swabs were obtained and placed into lysis buffer, and frozen at −80 • C until testing by real-time RT-PCR for 11 respiratory viruses.

Results: Of the 3168 children, >80% testing positive for one virus, with RSV the most common virus detected (44%). The RSV-associated hospitalization rate was highest in children <6 months with an annual range of 21.1-25.9 per 1000, compared to 6.0-8.0 in 6-11-month-olds and 1.6-2.5 in 12-23-month-olds.

A gender equity dimension is also present, as women tend to be further disadvantaged in their opportunities for physical activity where cities are not walkable. 259 This is another area in which laws and regulations that affect population health might lie well outside the usual reach of health ministries, thus requiring intersectoral cooperation. In a 2009 review of the evidence, WHO found that modifying the built environment, policies that reduce barriers to physical activity (such as walking, biking, and recreation), transport policies, and increased space for recreational activity were all effective interventions. 260 Examples of effective laws and regulations to increase physical activity include urban planning, land use management and zoning, transport policy (including taxes on car use, availability and accessibility of public transport, and bicycle and walking paths), and road and traffic control. 261 Local governments can play an important role because land use and zoning frequently fall under their remit. Local governments can implement building, zoning, and development regulations that encourage more physically active lifestyles: streets that are welcoming and safe for pedestrians and cyclists, facilities for public recreation (parks and playgrounds), and traffic calming measures. 15 The common theme among legal and regulatory interventions to prevent non-communicable diseases is that they promote small changes, across entire populations, for a mass impact. By simply changing a default option (eg, reducing salt in processed food, forbidding smoking in certain areas, or making public transport easier than car use), law has the power to facilitate profound changes in behaviour. Good laws can make healthier and safer behaviours the easier or normal choice. In conjunction with health promotion and awareness campaigns, countries can use law to support and encourage communities to resolve the problems arising from the shared risk factors of non-communicable diseases.",12.332275540823613,8.141244857428676

One of the first mental effects is intense social and psychological distress, especially fear of biological agents, even when they are not used. There are several reasons for this reaction: the invisibility of biological agents, the possibility that the agent can be spread by personal contact, the uncertainty of the extent of dangerousness of biological weapons, etc. On the other hand, the exposure to any severe strictly mathematically, the pyramid is on an incline. However, for simplicity of understanding it is presented as a four-equal-sided pyramid.) stressor-whether natural or man-made-is a risk factor for a range of long-term social and mental problems. Social problems emerging after exposure to biological agents, including population displacement, breakdown of community support systems, and social stigma associated with contagion or contamination, may further contribute to the phenomenon of mass psychogenic illness. 8, 9 Fig. 3 clearly presents both the epidemic of infectious disease and the epidemic of fear and panic with their numerical (number of cases) and time dimensions and their zone of action for each prevention level, and emphasizes the significance of primordial and primary prevention. It helps us observe the differences between these two types of epidemics in order to prepare intervention measures. The epidemic of fear and panic can be divided into three phases (Fig. 3 ). The first is the anticipation phase that encounters fear, anxiety, and a possible lower level of panic and somatization at the individual and community level. The presence of these phenomena depends on the seriousness of the threat, any recent terrorist attack in the same or a close territory, awareness of community vulnerability, etc. Medical workers summoned in response teams and exposed to affected (or presumed affected) patients may become anxious, ambivalent and try to avoid contact with patients. Such patterns of behaviour may have a demoralizing effect, and should be treated by providing relevant information (contagiousness of agent) and by implementing appropriate means of protection (protective clothing, vaccinations). Primordial and primary levels of prevention should comprise activities designed to mitigate the anticipation phase of the epidemic of fear and panic.",12.670009828218333,7.876442710372785

Both novel and existing diseases emerging in new contexts must be treated with humility, and response efforts to contain and mitigate their effects must be swift. Surveillance systems with strong regional networks, as well as early warning and response systems for outbreaks, must be improved. Greater surge capacity in terms of both human workforce and resources at the regional, national and international levels ultimately contributes to a flexible, rapid and effective response. As such, outbreak prevention, preparedness and response must be kept at the top of national and global agendas, and must not slip as it has in recent years. The International Health Regulations, and in particular the capacity to assess, plan and implement preparedness and surveillance measures, internationally and locally, must also be strengthened. Establishing robust health systems and implementing improved surveillance and response systems were identified within these documents as necessary conditions to better protect global health, but it was widely recognized that these steps alone are not sufficient. Fear, panic, denial and mistrust/distrust led to the rejection of public health interventions in many instances during this EVD outbreak. It should not be surprising, then, that the third theme emerging among the lessons is that community engagement and building trust are essential for successful global public health emergency preparedness and response. It was demonstrated that communities were capable of changing their approach to the disease (e.g., burial practices) when involved in planning. The needs of individuals and communities must be placed at the core of outbreak response, and this can only be accomplished by engaging with affected communities at every turn: in prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.",12.81986278514334,5.247104181090681

Urbanisation is proceeding rapidly even though nearly half of China's major cities do not comply with health-based standards for drinking water. 57 Water scarcity is a big challenge for China's urbanisation trajectory. Urban domestic water use per head has risen only slightly, despite the substantial rise in urban incomes, and the total urban water supply has remained somewhat constant. 58 This consistency has largely been maintained by policies designed to reduce industrial urban water demand (eg, by moving indus trial enterprises out of cities). 58 Future growth, especially in areas where water is scarce, might push municipal suppliers to contaminated sources with worrying consequences for public health. 59 Meanwhile, urban areas encroaching on rural communities will put pressure on nearby rural water supplies, which are less developed.

Specific symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, etc.) were not associated with increased likelihood of detection by one method versus the other, although nasal symptoms and sneezing were more common in those with RV detected versus not. There were limitations to this study. There were only small numbers of episodes for several specific viruses, making it difficult to generalize results to all viruses.

Second, while prior data shows our self-collected NS are equivalent to provider-collected samples, we have not evaluated this for throat swabs. However, this study focuses on the real-world application of self-collected samples, and our findings provide insight regarding viral load and detection in two separate respiratory sites. Third, we used different swabs for nasal (polyurethane foam) and throat (nylon flocked). The nasal swabs were chosen based on increased comfort and patient acceptability and our prior studies demonstrating comparability to provider-collected nasal washes [8] , and flocked throat swabs were the standard at the time; however, different swab types may yield different results.

Interestingly, including a throat swab did not increase the overall virus positivity. Ours was not a simultaneous, head-to-head comparison of nose-only versus nose-throat swabs, but in this setting, nose-only specimens had a higher rate of positivity (78% vs. 71%), although this difference was not significant. This finding may have been confounded by illness severity and virus shedding. A child with more severe illness may have been shedding more virus at the time of specimen collection, and in these children parents may have been less likely to attempt collection of the additionally invasive throat specimen. The only viral group where throat swabs appeared to improve detection was the adenoviruses, where a throat swab may have been more likely to capture adenoviral persistence in the oropharynx rather than acute infection, particularly in the age group under study [9] . A recent study showed that detecting adenoviral persistence 1-12 weeks after initial positivity was not possible using nose swabs alone in children 6 months to 4 years of age [10] . In our study, a delay from illness onset to specimen collection of up to 5 days did not appear to lower positivity using our method of couriering specimens from a subject's home to a central laboratory for PCR testing.

Confirmation of a diagnosis of FCV, as with FHV, relies primarily on detection of the virus, because the majority of cats are seropositive for FCV. Viral identification is particularly important in multicat settings. Virus isolation is the gold standard, because it detects replicating virus. Virus can be isolated from conjunctival and nasals swabs, but the highest success rate is achieved with oropharyngeal swabs. Samples should be shipped cooled (e.g., with ice packs) overnight to the testing laboratory. Antigen detection on slides made from swabs of the same sites, as for virus isolation, can also be done but is generally of lower sensitivity. As with FHV, detection of FCV nucleic acid by PCR is being used more frequently for diagnosis and is done on the same samples as for virus isolation. 3 The drawback of PCR testing for FCV not observed with FHV is the genetic variation of FCV, potentially leading to false-negative results. At least one report has identified a highly conserved genetic region of the virus that can be targeted for detection of the majority of field strains. 3, 4 However, it is possible that PCR assays may also detect vaccine virus in addition to field strains. 157 It is recommended that samples submitted for PCR NOT be frozen; refrigeration and shipment on an ice pack is suggested. 157 None of the assays described can distinguish the virus of virulent systemic disease from those causing more classic disease; this classification is currently based on",11.975752189515305,6.918118324046726

The need for microbiological examination of the respiratory tract was underlined by the isolation of bacteria. Pasteurella spp. were detected only in nasal swabs and not in the lower respiratory tract. This reflects that, in spite of the adverse effects caused by the aerosol infection, Pasteurellas were not able to spread to the lower respiratory tract. The isolation of Mycoplasma bovirhinis in nearly all nasal swabs of calves was not surprising. In a recent study the ubiquitous M. bovirhinis was isolated from nasal swabs of 23 out of 35 (66%) healthy calves [34] . Secondary infections with M. bovirhinis were observed in calves No. 1 (lung and trachea) and 5 (trachea), but electron microscopic and histological examinations did not reveal lesions typical of mycoplasmal pneumonia in our study. The detection of BRSV by immunofluorescence test in bronchiolar epithelium and in a few alveolar cells, as well as in cellular debris within the lumina of the pulmonary airways, the isolation of the virus from the BAL fluids of all calves and the gross and histological findings indicate that the disease in the experimentally infected calves was produced by BRSV alone. Based on the obtained data, the described model of an artificial RSV infection is suitable for further investigations. Thus, this model can be used to clarify pathogenetic aspects of the RSV infection including changes in lung function and mechanisms of airway responsiveness.

Approximately 20% of patients with HIV will develop wasting. With the advent of HAART, the incidence of AIDS wasting has decreased. However, the prevalence of wasting at the time of AIDS diagnosis has increased. The weight loss is typically lean muscle mass, which has a dramatic impact on quality of life. This loss of muscle mass is associated with increased mortality, accelerated disease progression, and impaired functioning. Many strategies have been developed to treat HIV wasting. Nutritional counseling and dietary supplements are effective in increasing fat free mass. Additionally, specific supplementation of l-glutamine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and l-arginine have been shown to increase lean muscle mass. Growth hormone and testosterone increase lean body mass, but these treatments have significant side effects. Some evidence shows anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies increase weight, but these agents present safety concerns in immunocompromised individuals. Resistance exercise provides significant increases in lean body mass as well as strength. Regimens vary, but typically they consist of a three-times-a-week regimen with a clearly defined number of repetitions and percent of maximal output for each repetition.

These include both serious human pathogens but also human and animal viruses and prions capable of multiplying and producing transmissible infectious diseases. Selecting and testing of stem cell lines and biotechnological products (e.g. bovine serum, tripsine, culture media) is one part of a strategy for establishing a viral safety program (Cobo et al., 2006) . While the technology to avoid the animal products in the culture manufacturing is being developed, the safety of the human and/or animal products used in the cell cultures with respect to viral and prion contamination could be obtained for application of an exhaustive program of viral screening by means the combination of techniques above-mentioned (Tables  2 and 3 ). The presence of viruses (including non-pathogenic types) or prions in a human therapeutic product would most likely render it unacceptable for clinical use. At the moment, the cell banks must have a panel of tests to detect serious pathogens like endogenous viruses, exogenous viruses and prions. This panel of tests should necessarily include reverse transcriptase detection as a general test for retroviruses, electron microscopy that can detect different kinds of viral particles and characterize many unknown isolates present in cell cultures and molecular techniques like PCR (conventional or real-time) and RT-PCR tests to include all the viruses that we know pose a risk to the product. For prion detection, these banks must have a procedure based on the Western blot or ELISA technology for the detection of antibodies (e.g. 6H4, 1E4) that can be present in the cell cultures. Some of these tests may also need to be applied to culture reagents of animal origin, and any testing performed by the manufacturer should be carefully evaluated before accepting the reagents for use.",12.192932547790916,7.1609784161866585

Urban dwellers consuming bushmeat as a luxury item are unlikely to suffer nutritional hardship as a result of this forfeiture, since they can generally switch to other readily-available protein sources (Bennett, 2002) . The tragedy, however, is that the direct costs of biodiversity loss are expected to fall heavily and disproportionately on millions of rural people across the developing world, who have very few affordable alternatives at their disposal (Milner-Gulland & Bennett, 2003) . Despite the widespread reliance on bushmeat, surprisingly little research has been conducted to quantify the impacts of wildlife depletions on human health and livelihoods. Nevertheless, two seminal studies (Fa et al., 2003; Golden et al., 2011) have indicated that the loss of access to wildlifewhether due to strict enforcement of existing conservation policies or due to unbridled unsustainable harvestswill have direct and catastrophic effects on food security, nutrition and well-being, most markedly through waning supplies of crucial protein and micronutrients.

Recent guidelines 4 have suggested that testing for viral pathogens be performed in patients with clinical and epidemiologic findings suggestive of viral illness,0.5393931793730193,3.832662343978882,2.683993339538574,81850ff3-ff82-42a4-b1d7-b007adf73f55,custom_license/Acute Febrile Respiratory Illness in the ICU* Reducing Disease Transmission CHEST Recent Advances in Chest Medicine Recent Advances in Chest Medicine,"In most cases, the etiology of a febrile respiratory illness is largely unknown on admission to the ICU. 34 Bacterial pathogens constitute most cases, and they often can be suspected early based on clinical findings and Gram stain of the sputum. Other cases may be more difficult, requiring further epidemiologic and diagnostic testing. Recent guidelines 4 have suggested that testing for viral pathogens be performed in patients with clinical and epidemiologic findings suggestive of viral illness, as well as placing them in droplet or airborne isolation depending on the suspected pathogen. However, many of these viral pathogens are highly contagious emerging infections or in fact may be novel strain. 7, 35 Often these patients will not be isolated and tested for these pathogens on hospital admission, and they will additionally undergo higher-risk aerosolizing procedures ( Table 2 ) that will increase the likelihood for disease transmission. This puts both HCWs and other patients at risk for acquiring disease, as experienced during the SARS epidemic. Therefore, a standardized approach, with early isolation and testing of these cases, can reduce the likelihood of disease transmission of an emerging pathogen within the ICU. Figure 1 outlines an approach to early isolation, testing, and involvement of institutional infection control, infectious diseases, and public health in patients with FRI and respiratory failure admitted to the ICU. All patients with FRI and respiratory failure should immediately be isolated on arrival to the health-care system, and subsequently undergo initial diagnostic testing, including pretreatment Gram stain, respiratory culture, and urine antigen testing for Legionella. If an etiologic agent is identified on initial screening and clinical findings (ie, Gram-positive diplococci with a lobar pneumonia on radiography), targeted treatment and ICU admission are performed. Further isolation of the patient can be discontinued at this point, depending on the identified organism. However, if an agent is not easily identified as often seen with viral causes of FRIs, the patients should remain in isolation and further diagnostic testing should be performed. Isolation should most likely be droplet, but based on specific epidemiologic clues airborne isolation may be instituted (Table 1) . 20 Many cases of viral pneumonia in the ICU are suspected based on certain at-risk groups, epidemiologic clues, and specific clinical findings. If these are present, testing should target these pathogens, but viral culture and isolation should be performed to rule out other agents as well. If a certain viral pathogen, such as avian influenza or SARS, is suspected based on these clues, hospital infection control, infectious diseases, microbiology, and the public health officials should be notified immediately. Although bronchoscopy generates aerosols and can increase transmission risk, it should not be avoided in these cases because viral isolation and etiology becomes important from a public health perspective and transmission risk is low when the appropriate PPE is used. Isolation of the virus from a nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate is highest early in disease course, but by the time the patient has disease developed in the lower respiratory tract with respiratory failure, a lower respiratory sample by bronchoscopy may provide the highest yield. In addition to more specific testing, a sample should be sent for viral culture, which provides a viral isolate for further testing, subtyping, and resistance analysis if ever indicated (unless avian influenza is suspected, since this requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory Involvement of institutional infection control, infectious disease specialist, microbiology, and public health is paramount for successful containment of disease and thus should be started as early as possible, as outlined in Figure 1 . Hospital-based infection control will assist in isolation and HCW protection, and the hospital-based microbiology laboratory should be notified of suspected pathogens, allowing for worker protection and targeted testing of samples. Public health involvement will allow a broader viral testing, including additional agents, subtyping, and resistance testing. If the agent is a novel or emerging pathogen, as seen with SARS or avian influenza, early public health involvement will allow for rapid laboratory testing, epidemiologic investigation, case definition, and community prevention. Finally, public health also has a broader view of the disease burden within the region. A single physician seeing a patients with FRI and ARDS may not be aware of multiple other cases within the region, and thus involvement of public health allows this broader perspective.",12.980583831014801,8.779030535141526

Every public health jurisdiction in the country has the responsibility to develop and maintain the capability to carry out first response and federally assisted mass drug dispensing and vaccination campaigns tailored to its local population. At least four reasons underlie this rule: 1. Local mass prophylaxis activities need to be under way before the arrival of any federal assets. 2. Federal or state assistance will not include sufficient personnel to fully command or staff community-wide mass prophylaxis dispensing operations. 3. Mass prophylaxis operations are likely to remain under local control even after federal or state assets are delivered. 4. Dispensing and follow-up operations are likely to continue after the departure of federal or state assets . Once requested, assets from the SNS are likely to arrive in less time than it takes to set up a network of fully functional dispensing or vaccination centers. Each center must have a well-defined supply route linking it to the receive, store, and stage site for these SNS materials, as well as to any local stockpiles (see Fig. 12 .4). Most local stockpiles are predesignated for use by local first responders, hospitals, and emergency management personnel to ensure that they are ready to work with the public as soon as or before federal assets arrive. Onsite stockpile management requires the ability to ensure proper storage (eg, coolers), inventory management, and security of supplies. If the center is dispensing drugs or vaccines under investigational new drug protocols, local staff may have to track the patients to whom those supplies are distributed. However, recent legislative proposals call for the creation of emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to facilitate rapid dispensing of off-label or investigational medicines and vaccines in the setting of mass prophylaxis (Hupert et al., 2004) .",14.320343085295503,8.089191853859315

Medical care or measures provided to a large percentage of a population to prevent or protect them from disease. The best example of this is the smallpox eradication campaign that rid the world of one of the worst human diseases in 1980. As a program, mass prophylaxis can be a mitigation measure, a preparedness initiative, or a postevent response function. • Mitigation. Measures taken in advance of a disaster aimed at decreasing or eliminating its impact on society and the environment. • Overt. Open and observable, not secret or hidden. • Preparedness. Actions that are undertaken to reduce the negative consequences of events in which there is insufficient human control to institute mitigation measures. Plans, training, exercises, stockpiles, warning systems, and capacity building for response commonly fall into the realm of preparedness. • Recovery. The coordinated process of supporting emergency-affected communities in reconstruction of the physical infrastructure and restoration of emotional, social, economic, and physical well-being.

To further assist in microbial identification, nucleic acid amplification has been introduced in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Such testing was initially done for viruses, allowing detection of small amounts of viral nucleic acid quickly. Similar tests also have been applied to bacteria, especially those that are difficult to grow on routine culture media, or are slow-growing such as Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Mycobacterium. In addition, there are ongoing efforts to integrate these new techniques into routine clinical microbiology testing, including the diagnosis of sepsis [1] .",17.490003737370586,9.709472470875724

There remains great space for improvement before mass spectrometry realizes its ultimate potential in the clinic.",11.590545201464622,6.963401945886458

A major surge constitutes the need for mass critical care. Most hospitals can accommodate a minor surge (an increase in admissions of up to 15% above normal capacity) and could probably cope with a moderate surge that requires a regional response. However, in a mass pediatric critical care situation, both local and regional resources would be overwhelmed. Response would entail a major increase in capacity, crisis standards of care with different nurse/patient ratios, and care by personnel not necessarily trained in critical care.",12.26850318877808,6.922625416409165

Respiratory infection control in the ED is challenging due to patient crowding, inadequate staff coverage, low resources, and the high proportion of immuno-compromised patients (35) . Additional challenges to compliance include the presence of trainees rotating through the department, and an increased reliance on traveling nursing staff who may not be familiar with local policy or may be overwhelmed with other tasks. In the event of a severe pandemic during which 30% of the health care workforce is expected to become ill, compliance with transmission-based precautions will become increasingly dif- ficult due to shortages in health care providers, nursing staff, and environmental services staff to provide cleaning and disinfection. Limiting factors to compliance also include logistical problems such as the number of private rooms available in the ED, the available supplies of personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, and the volume of patients in the ED. For example, one challenge during the SARS epidemic was fulfilling increased demand for personal protective equipment and biohazard bags (36) . Policies to enforce strict isolation are costly and time intensive and these policies may prevent health care workers from entering those patient rooms with the same frequency due to the burden of mask and gown use, with a potential impact on patient care and satisfaction (37) .

For the collection of swab specimens, commercially available swabs made of rayon, Dacron, polyester, and nylon are acceptable for use. Calcium alginatetipped swabs are toxic to some viruses, and swabs with wooden handles can contain toxins and formaldehydes that may inhibit the detection of viruses. Recently, flocked swabs (Abu-Diab et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008) have been used for the collection of large numbers of epithelial cells from the lining of the nasopharynx. The flocked swab tips are made with perpendicular nylon fibers that act like a soft brush to dislodge epithelial cells. Several commercially available media are suitable for the transport of respiratory samples. Transport medium is necessary to prevent drying of the sample, to maintain viability of the virus, and to inhibit the growth of microbial contaminants. While viral transport media, such as M4 (Remel, Lenexa, KS), require transport at 4°C, transport media have become available that allow room-temperature storage prior to use as well as transport for up to 24 hours after specimen collection-for example, M4-RT (Remel, Lenexa, KS) and universal transport medium room temperature (UTM-RT) (Copan, Italia, Brescia, Italy) (Barger et al., 2005) .",13.896809191975475,8.438187237596232

A large number of respiratory epithelial cells can be obtained by proper collection of nasopharyngeal washes and aspirates, and this method is recommended for hospitalized patients, where an accurate diagnosis is critical for appropriate antiviral therapy and infection control measures. The detection of RSV, in particular, has been shown to improve with the collection of washes and aspirates rather than swabs (Sung et al., 2008) . Recent studies in children have suggested that the use of flocked swabs transported in a viral transport medium provides an increase in specimen quality over other collection swabs with comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates (Abu-Diab et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008) . Walsh et al. (2008) showed there was no significant difference in sensitivity between nasopharyngeal aspirates transported in a viral transport medium and nasopharyngeal samples on flocked swabs in viral transport media. The less invasive flocked swab specimens would be an attractive alternative to nasopharyngeal aspirates, particularly in outpatient settings.

[5] [6] [7] Nevertheless, both living and deceased organ donors have been implicated in donor-derived infections; transmissible pathogens are diverse and include bacteria (e.g., pyogenic organisms and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), fungi (especially endemic mycoses and Candida), viruses (most commonly herpesviruses), and parasitical organisms (including strongyloides). 5, 7 Standard evaluations of both should include a thorough history of past infections and exposures associated with transmissible infections. 3, 6 Because deceased donor histories are provided by surrogates, they are generally less detailed; however, the increased use of paired kidney exchange has led to increased numbers of evaluations being obtained outside the recipient's center. Whether this impacts on the quality of donor information is unknown. In both cases, laboratory testing should mirror that of the transplant candidate with specific attention to active infections at the time of deceased donation and infections that may reactivate in an immunosuppressed transplant recipient (including herpesviruses, endemic mycoses, and parasitical infections) in both living and deceased donors (see Table 40 .2). Live donors may be evaluated for latent TB using either intradermal tuberculin PPD testing or IGRA. 8 Given the limitations of TB testing in the setting of deceased donor evaluation, it is especially important to obtain historical information and radiography to assess the potential for deceased donor latent infection. 8 The presence of potentially transmissible donor infections may not exclude a donor from transplantation. Donors with bacteremia, meningitis, or other bacterial infections that do not involve the kidney have been successfully used and may be considered, assuming that the donor has been appropriately treated for 24 to 48 hours and there are acceptable antimicrobial treatment options. 6, [9] [10] [11] Latent infections in the donor including TB and endemic mycoses may be treated with appropriate antimicrobials after transplantation. Donors who are actively infected with organisms that do not have effective treatment options should be excluded. Special attention should be paid to deceased donors with undiagnosed central nervous system (CNS) processes as these donors have been implicated in severe and fatal donor-derived infections, including West Nile Virus, rabies, and Cryptococcus; consequently the risks associated with using these donors must be balanced with the need for transplantation. 12 Recent publications have focused on donors who pose an increased risk for blood-borne viral disease transmission because of behaviors associated with recent acquisition of HIV and HCV 13 (Table 40. 4) . Depending on the screening methodology used (serological vs. nucleic acid testing), there is a window of variable duration during which infection may be present but cannot yet be detected. The Public Health Service (PHS) increased risk donor (IRD) criteria attempt to identify donors at risk for window period infections and disease transmission. The absolute risk for disease transmission overall is quite small, but varies based on the risk behavior, the infection in question, and the testing methodology; for example the risk for HIV transmission from a donor who was incarcerated with negative nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing is 0.9 per 10,000 but the risk for HCV infection from a donor with active intravenous (IV) drug abuse and antibody testing alone is 300 per 10,000. [14] [15] [16] The prevalence of PHS IRDs is increasing and IV drug users represent the largest proportion of this group of donors. [17] [18] [19] Compared with deceased donors overall, PHS IRDs are more likely to be young and male and less likely to meet expanded donor criteria 20 ; despite the better organ quality afforded by these donors, these organs are more likely to be discarded (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.74). 20 However, for recipients who accept these organs, outcomes are equivalent to those observed with non-PHS IRDs. 18, 20 The updated guidelines and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policies require NAT testing for all IRDs as well as specify testing for living donors to be performed within the 28 days before the transplant surgery. 13 There was also greater emphasis placed on the informed consent process for recipients and clarification regarding the assays and intervals for posttransplant testing; recipients of PHS IRDs should have serological and NAT testing for HIV, HBV, and HCV performed between 1 and 3 months after transplant and testing for HBV at 1 year.",12.688775184688078,8.282533402272053

To fill this void, independent investigators have turned to the development of user-defined, or ""homebrew,"" molecular detection methods in the clinical laboratory. The implementation of user-defined NAA testing has revolutionized clinical molecular infectious disease testing. In addition, commercially-available non-FDA-approved NAA assays are increasingly becoming available as analyte specific reagents (ASRs). Though all reagents necessary for the amplification reaction can be purchased commercially, assay development and verification studies must be performed by individual laboratories. In many cases, there are no comparative studies between user-defined NAA procedures, including ASRs, limiting the comparative value of assays between institutions (particularly in viral load monitoring) and restricting the application of such procedures to more experienced laboratories. It is not without considerable cost that a molecular infectious disease diagnostic lab is developed. It represents an institutional commitment because the costs may only be offset when analysis of hospital-wide cost savings is employed (i.e. shorter hospital stays, decreased use of unncecessary antibiotics). The costs incurred not only stem from instrumentation purchases, but also from the dedicated, expert staff required for such testing. Since many academic medical centers have resorted to implementing user-defined assays, verification and validation studies are substantial and require extensive resources, including time, staff, and expertise. These studies are crucial to defining the performance of the assay and determining appropriate clinical utilization. The FDA, diagnostic companies, and major molecular infectious disease laboratories need to work together to resolve the poor standardization that exists between laboratories using user-defined assays or ASRs.",14.433810552938109,7.7358218176604945

In fact, in a long-term event, such as a communicable disease event, supply shortages may become an increasing and broader issue. A disas-ter may quickly exhaust available supplies, including medications, or may prevent the further replenishment of supplies from outside of the affected area. It is important to conduct a needs assessment and have an ongoing materials management process to assess current and anticipated needs and acquisition and appropriation of supplies on hand. In many U.S. disasters, supply shortages have not occurred,but rather,excessive donations have created a different challenge (see Chapter 35). Unfortunately, the preevent purchase and stockpile of equipment can be costly and difficult to justify in the current economic environment and as healthcare facilities continue to shift to ""just in time"" inventories. Graded increases in par levels of supplies, regionally leveraged purchases, and rotation into stock can ease the financial burden of preparedness. Federal response systems anticipate this need and purchase, and strategic forward deployment has been under way at that level. However, depending on the nature of the incident, it is prudent to assume that facilities and agencies should plan on being self-sufficient for the first 48 to 72 hours after an event.

Country characteristics, including income, population, region, democracy, tobacco production, smoking prevalence and network participation were analyzed to determine their effects on the frequency, type and strength of tobacco control policy adoption among WHO Member States. Bivariate analyses were conducted for each country characteristic and used to compare the frequency and strength of control policies adopted between pre-negotiation and negotiation periods. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to determine the predictive nature of these variables. Findings. The frequency of policy adoption escalated between 2002 and 2003, the years in which the FCTC negotiations were most intense. The strength of policies adopted also shifted significantly towards policies promoted by WHO.

Some researchers noted that there were few comprehensive sets of policies addressing obesity and dietrelated chronic diseases in the developing world. 54 This remains true today.

Although the main strategy has been to provide information for consumers, countries have made notable steps in reformulating food products, establishing school food standards, nutrition labeling, restricting food marketing to children, promoting fruits and vegetables, and more recently, implementation of food taxes. However, when it comes to national food and agricultural policies, the focus remains mainly on producers. The policies are also not designed with public health in mind. For example, the relationship between population nutrition and chronic disease risk is often ignored in most agriculture policies, 56 which was corroborated by other analyses. One particular supporting analysis points out that current food policies are largely incompatible with good public health, but interventions that include food producers, processors, and food providers can markedly improve a population's dietary health. Such an improvement would require cooperation between farming and commercial food producers in order to counter the current trends in food supplies and to reshape the nutrition transition. 57 In the WHO nutrition policy review, 58 the most commonly reported policy activities in food security and agriculture were research (59 %) and supply of seeds (55 %), subsidized sales and construction of irrigation systems (48 %), construction of rural infrastructure (42 %), price control (41 %), international agreements to increase domestic food production (41 %), production credit from stateowned banks (39 %) and subsidized food for vulnerable groups (38 %). 59 The main policy goals of these programmes were to increase output and farm incomes, followed by improving the quality of the products. Few of the broad policy goals explicitly mentioned nutritional goals, such as combating undernutrition, reducing overweight or obesity, or promoting a healthy diet.",13.317556655349172,6.136418557742877

Nasopharyngeal swabs or washings may be used for viral isolation. In general, higher concentrations of virus are found in nasal secretions than in oropharyngeal secretions. During influenza A epidemics, oropharyngeal secretions contain higher concentrations of influenza virions than nasal secretions. In alveolar macrophages, influenza A viruses produce cytopathogenic effects (CPEs), but are nonspecific and difficult to detect. CPEs due to influenza A are apparent in approximately 50% of cultures within 3 days of inoculation and in approximately 90% within 5 days. Identification of cells showing CPE may be verified using immunofluorescent technique or type/subtype specific antisera. The most common rapid method of influenza laboratory diagnosis is by FA techniques. For FA testing for respiratory viruses, nasopharyngeal aspirates are preferred to swabs. FA influenza assays identify viral antigens in infected respiratory epithelial cells. [22] [23] [24] [25] During the ''herald wave'' of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic in New York, it was realized that there were problems with screening tests, that is, RIDTs. It was hoped that rapid screening tests for influenza A would detect swine influenza (H1N1), an influenza A virus. Rapid influenza A test positivity was usually predictive of RT-PCR positivity for swine influenza (H1N1). It was quickly realized that negative rapid influenza A testing did not rule out swine influenza (H1N1). False negative rapid influenza A testing for swine influenza (H1N1) was 30%. Respiratory FA viral testing detects influenza A, influenza B, metapneumoviruses, RSVs, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses. Unfortunately, respiratory FA viral testing did not correlate with either rapid influenza A testing or RT-PCR testing. Although the definitive test for swine influenza (H1N1) diagnosis remains RT-PCR, during the pandemic, RT-PCR testing was restricted. Restricted RT-PCR testing resulted in tremendous difficulties in making/ruling out the diagnosis of swine influenza (H1N1) and in initiating/discontinuing influenza precautions. [53] [54] [55] 59 Because of restricted swine influenza (H1N1) RT-PCR testing, clinical criteria were developed for patients presenting with ILIs who had a negative rapid influenza A test. By combining key clinical and nonspecific laboratory features, a clinical diagnosis of probable swine influenza was developed at Winthrop-University Hospital by the Infectious Disease Division. This permitted an operational clinical approach to placing admitted adult patients on influenza precautions/treatment, and was also useful in differentiating swine influenza (H1N1) from its mimics. 54 (see Box 1, Figs. 1-4 , Tables 3-5) .",12.506647786150396,7.12050395431867

In addition to changes in disease dynamics, the fluctuations in temperatures, and the associated environmental alterations and interactions, could test the resilience of life on Earth. Climate change challenges the adaptability of human settlements by altering water and food security, affecting shelter availability, generating extreme climatic events, and promoting population migration (Costello et al. 2009 ).

In this study, schools that reported being better prepared for a future disaster or pandemic were more likely to be designated as a POD and to have experienced increased student or employee morbidity or mortality related to H1N1 during the pandemic. The POD designation may be a significant factor in readying schools for disasters or pandemics, because it requires that the school be actively engaged in local or regional disaster planning efforts. This involvement likely influences the school in preparing for future disasters and may provide additional guidance to the school on disaster planning efforts, such as plan development and testing, through interaction with regional emergency managers/experts. Schools with better disaster and pandemic preparedness scores were also more likely to have had a lead nurse or a school nurse involved in the school disaster planning committee complete the survey compared with schools that had a non-lead nurse or a nurse not on the disaster planning committee participate in the study. This finding has critical implications for schools wishing to improve their disaster and pandemic planning efforts. One simple strategy for increasing school disaster preparedness appears to be involving school nurses in planning efforts. School nurses are the health professionals responsible for implementing policies and programs to prevent infection transmission in schools, 28 and thus are those best able to inform school disaster planning committees on aspects of plan development that will affect infection transmission. In addition, the National Association of School Nurses recommends that school nurses be involved in school disaster preparedness activities. 29 School nurses may require additional training in pandemic planning to feel comfortable in this role. Future research should evaluate competencies for school nurses related to pandemic planning and assess school nurses' current comfort and ability related to performing in this crucial role.",14.797710784790311,6.897394409756946

However, even though ESCOs can better manage the performance risks by ensuring system efficiency, optimisation control and better maintenance, the actual energy saving is still uncertain. This is attributed to various extrinsic factors including weather conditions, economic circumstances, as well as occupants' behaviour, which can significantly affect the actual energy savings. For example, the occupancy rate of hotel may decrease dramatically due to economic downturn, resulting in a significant reduction in the actual energy savings. Therefore, a dilemma is often observed from the ESCOs' perspective in determining the amount of guaranteed energy savings.

The availability of specific antibodies or the susceptibility to ad hoc chemical reagents has aided the identification of a handful of other PTMs, including N1-methyladenosine (m1A) (37), cytosine-5-methylation (m5C) (38), guanosine methylation (m1G and m22G (39) (40)), 2-O’-methylation (41) and pseudouridylation (42). However, the investigation of the remaining known PTMs has been severely hampered by the chronic absence of suitable analytical tools. This obstacle could be overcome by the broader diffusion of mass spectrometric (MS) approaches, which analyze genuine RNA strands rather than the cDNA copies generated to complete RNA-seq analysis (43–45). This type of platform enables the unequivocal characterization of any PTMs present on RNA according to unique mass and fragmentation features (46–48). Indeed, MS analysis has been instrumental to the discovery of all known PTMs listed in the RNA Modification Database (4,5). Based on this platform, we have recently developed a robust approach for an agnostic analysis of PTMs at the whole transcriptome level (49,50). This comprehensive approach can reveal the effects of different environmental factors on the expression of the entire complement of modifications, including variations of distinct subsets contained in the cell, and thus enables the investigation of RNA modifications at a systems level (50).",12.90076328751764,6.862003027429804

These protease inhibitors mitigate the effects of proteases expressed by pathogens and recruited innate immune cells. Maintaining the balance between antiproteases and proteases in the airway lumen during infection is pivotal in preventing lung inflammation and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. In COPD patients, levels of SLPI and lysozyme were shown to decrease with bacterial infection, while lactoferrin levels remain unchanged.139 This could be due to inactivation of SLPI by proteases or decreased expression of SLPI, but either way the end result under these conditions is an imbalance in the ratio of antiproteases to proteases in the airway lumen. Therefore, neutralization of proteases would be beneficial in this situation. Accordingly, administration of SLPI decreased the levels of IL-8 and elastase activity in airway secretion of cystic fibrosis patients, who also have reduced SLPI in their airway lumen.140",16.946448853657962,10.294534498320235

The objective of this study was to compare the results of disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) for susceptibility testing of 48 M. haemolytica isolates collected before and after mass medication with tulathromycin. Each isolate was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing with disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and whole genome sequencing. For a given antimicrobial, the percentage of isolates classified as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant were compared between the three methods using an exact test of marginal homogeneity. Overall categorical agreement between testing methods ranged from 42‐100%, with the lowest agreement being for comparisons of broth microdilution and WGS for penicillin in cattle prior to mass medication. Perfect agreement was found for ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, and gamithromycin for all testing methods in isolates prior to mass medication and for ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline, gamithromycin, and tilmicosin for all testing methods after mass medication.

This caused significant delays in recognising the outbreak, hindering the roll-out of the vaccination programme and diminishing the effectiveness of targeted vaccination, resulting in increased spread of disease and longer time to containment. The reagent shortage continued throughout 2016 and the first 8 months of 2017, and by the time the required reagents became available at national level, the disease had spread to multiple states.7 Improved access to rapid tests to speed up diagnosis of patients presenting to triage tents was badly needed.

In our model D sums up at least three separate factors, i.e. the biological incubation period, and an additional delay from first very mild symptoms to symptoms warranting testing under the constraint of limiting testing capacities, and a possible delay before a testing slot is available. At present, the incubation is reported by the WHO as being in a broad range from 1-14 days with a mean of 5 days [29] , and the WHO states that 'symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually'. A gradual onset of symptoms may delay testing because people tend to wait before asking to be tested, or may be asked to wait as testing in more urgent cases is prioritized. Adding a mean of 5 days of incubation period to the patient waiting for three days after gradual symptom onset before asking for a test, and waiting 1 days for a test would be a plausible scenario in Germany. The resulting 9 days are compatible with the median and spread of the posterior median of D = 9.5 we found, given the wide range of durations for the incubation period.

In countries such as South Korea, where testing has been thorough, the distribution of test timing will be crucial; if many of those tested were infected some time ago but only had mild or asymptomatic infections (and therefore did not present for treatment), they will be more likely to return a false negative result. In countries that do not currently have mass testing, there are calls for testing to be expanded to the population at large with the aim of determining how many people have, or have recently had, infection. While RT-PCR testing of key workers will be of great importance (particularly those working with vulnerable groups), our results suggest that there may be some benefit to testing indiscriminately; conducting a single test on someone who had symptoms 10 days ago will have a nearly 33% false negative rate (using a nasal swab; 52.89% for a throat swab).

Improved understanding of the presence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level can help government and hospital officials implement appropriate policies to mitigate the exponential spread of COVID-19, and diminish the future strain on healthcare facilities. Despite pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, broad access to testing in the United States (US) has thus far been severely limited. While it is impractical to test every US resident for SARS-CoV-2, the virus has been found in the stool of confirmed COVID-19 patients (1), making it a promising candidate for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). WBE can help detect the presence of pathogens across municipalities and estimate population prevalence without individual testing, and inform public health officials of the efficacy of interventions. The closely related virus SARS-CoV was detected in wastewater from Chinese hospitals during the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic (2) , and WBE has been used for the early detection and direct mitigation of disease outbreaks in Israel, Egypt and Sweden (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . We have previously used this technique to measure and map the use of pharmaceuticals across residential communities (8) .

In fact, the typical lab-workflow is governed by a set of rigid protocols which might be critically affected by factors such as the availability of manpower, swabs, reagents and other laboratory materials. In emergency situations, such a workflow can be disrupted and temporal inconsistency might appear as a result. For example, a set of samples might be delivered to a laboratory with longer than usual delays with respect to the time of collection or a given lab can only complete a screening process for a certain number of samples. In both the cases, one day (or more) shift in the release of the lab results can be reasonably expected.

In such cases, conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak to more effectively mitigate the spread of the disease. Using a simple epidemiological model we show that, however, there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or ""flatten"" the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R 0 ) of the disease, such that as the R 0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire further investigations within the context of more complex and data-driven epidemiological models, and can ultimately help decision makers to improve temporal social distancing policies to mitigate the spread of epidemics.",14.504001508996332,5.507088636652534
