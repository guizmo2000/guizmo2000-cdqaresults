Due to its retrospective nature, confounding may be present. LOT was defined as discrete days in which antibiotics were received. Thus, differences in antibiotic duration at smaller intervals may have gone undetected. Only patients with positive tests results admitted to our hospitals were selected for primary analysis, not allowing clinical comparisons to those admitted with negative test results. We did not further evaluate chest imaging that was deemed abnormal, thus potentially overemphasizing the impact of minimal radiographic changes in subjects with abnormal imaging. However, this method was the most conservative for establishing normal imaging. We noted an increase in the detection of influenza A by the RPP, likely because fewer initial rapid influenza tests were performed in this population compared to the RVP. The rapid influenza PCR was available during both seasons. Asthma was more prevalent in the RPP-positive group, possibly reflecting an increasing use of the RPP for cohorting; however, the proportions of patients with asthma receiving antibiotics were not significantly different (50 and 51.8%). ED physicians were recommended to only order the RVP or RPP in patients who were likely to be admitted; thus, it is possible that the lower likelihood of admission in the RPP-positive group reflects ED physicians poorly predicting which patients were likely to be admitted. However, admission rates were similar among patients with negative test results. More patients in the RVP group were admitted to the ICU; however, accounting for a higher level of care did not change the conclusions of our primary outcomes. Finally, there was no difference observed in 30-day readmission, in-hospital mortality, or positive C. difficile test results, likely due to the low frequency of these events.",38.535588919530625,16.17430952468873

Most RIDT diagnostic kits can detect influenza nucleoprotein antigen [14] . However, RIDT has two potential limitations: i) relatively large numbers of influenza viruses must be present for accurate detection in the collected sample, and ii) inability to distinguish between influenza subtypes. Overall, sensitivity and accuracy of RIDT are lower than those of qRT-PCR-based methods that not only can amplify small amounts of target viral RNA, but also can allow for determination of influenza A virus subtype using specifically designed primers [12] . Despite qRT-PCR-based approaches have these advantages, they typically take at least a few hours up to 2 days to obtain results [15] . In addition, qRT-PCR needs trained personnel and sophisticated facilities for sample processing. These disadvantages limit its function in ensuring rapid prescription and administration of antiviral agents to patients. Recently, many Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived molecular tests have been approved for point-of-care use (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm).

It is capable of airborne transmission to other individuals [33] . Prescribing anti-influenza drugs following rapid and accurate diagnosis of an infection is thus critical to mitigate viral spread in the early stage of an outbreak. Many primary care providers use RIDT to diagnose influenza infections because it is simple to use with relatively rapid results. However, the accuracy of this approach is lower than that of qRT-PCR. A highly accurate gene-based diagnostic assay would serve as a valuable local on-site tool if it is easy to use with rapid results. Although many CLIAwaived molecular tests satisfy these criteria due to recent advancement, most of these developed tests are limited to detect seasonal influenza without appropriate subtype discrimination. In this study, we developed a multiplex RT-LAMP method to distinctively diagnose human influenza (e.g., seasonal influenza type B, H1N1, H3N2) and avian influenza viruses infecting humans (e.g., H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9). Hence, this developed method would be essential in some countries where these viruses are cocirculating in humans. Moreover, the RT-LAMP method described here can be used to intuitively detect these viruses using a one-pot colorimetric visualization approach, making it a more feasible POCT. Our multiplex RT-LAMP detection system was designed to be a more feasible RIDT with accuracy as high as RT-PCR methods for detecting most recent human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans. Although a variety of reliable and affordable RT-LAMP methods have been developed to detect human or avian influenza viruses, each can only detect an individual subtype [23-29, 34, 35] or limited subtypes of human influenza viruses and/or avian influenza viruses infecting humans [18, 30, 36, 37] . In a pandemic, it is critical to rapidly differentiate patients infected by seasonal flu from those infected by an emerging strain. Thus, reliable and affordable multiplex detection tools should be capable of identifying broadspectrum influenza viruses infecting humans. Moreover, RT-LAMP method for most recent emerging HPAI H5N6 and H5N8 viruses which have high potential to infect humans has rarely been developed or evaluated for its detection efficacy. In addition to broad-spectrum detection of human influenza viruses using our multiplex RT-LAMP assay, we optimized commercially available colorimetric RT-LAMP enzyme. Previous studies have also shown that the colorimetric visualization system using dyes (e.g., SYBR) is detectable by naked eyes [38] . However, these colorimetric methods require additional steps (e.g., adding dye to test for color changes after reaction or the use of a UV device for visualization [39] ) that can decrease their utility in resource-limited primary care settings.",26.015928250884006,10.709369632420188

At one end of the spectrum, a conventional RT-PCR test with specific primers and probes provides a highlyspecific, sensitive, rapid, convenient, quantitative, relatively inexpensive, and high-throughput format that can provide valuable surveillance information. However, these tests are not optimal for surveillance when the exact nature of the pandemic virus is not known. Moreover, without supplemental nucleic acid sequencing, conventional RT-PCR-based tests are not capable of signaling the appearance of new genetic variants, except by potentially demonstrating a loss of sensitivity. Further, a single RT-PCR test can achieve only a single presence/absence analysis limited to the specific target for which it was designed. Discrimination of all known variants of influenza at the level of resolution described here would require hundreds of independent RT-PCR reactions. At the other end of the spectrum, virus isolation using culture methods followed by complete genome sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the virus' sequence and provides cladelevel resolution and highly detailed information regarding virus evolution.

In MEMS microphones, a suspended micro-structure deflects as a function of the amplitude and frequency (pitch) of incoming acoustic pressure waves. This deflection is then converted to an electric signal using either capacitive or piezoelectric transduction. The airflow into and out of the respiratory system generates acoustic waves that can be detected by mobile phone microphones making the respiratory track a test subject for this class of point-of-care systems. An example of such a system correlates the spectrum of respiration sound to flow rate of air, which can then be used for diagnosis of respiratory conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis [61] . Quality of measurement is heavily reliant on signal processing techniques to reduce the effects of environmental noise and dependence on microphone distance. Goel et al.

For example, two meta-analyses of the rapid antigen-based test for group-A Streptococcal pharyngitis found an 86% sensitivity [45, 46] , so 14% of true positives are missed by this method. Here we demonstrate a simple RPA-based genomic procedure offering flexibility and rapid detection within a similar timeframe as the rapid tests (10-15 min) that is suitable to a point-of-care application. We show that we can detect down to the femtomolar (fM) / picogram (pg) range (Fig. 1b) . We found that spiking in up to 100x more non-specific DNA than mef(A) + DNA did not inhibit the assay, which remained extremely quantitative and specific to true target levels (Fig. 5 ). Detection of antimicrobial resistance genes has been more frequently performed with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) rather than RPA. Examples include detection of the beta-lactamase responsible for carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii [47, 48] , the class 1 integron-integrase gene intI1 from environmental samples [49] , msrA from Staphylococcus aureus [50] and mcr-1 from Enterobacteriaceae isolates [51] . In all cases, detection occurred within 20-50 min and generally sensitivity was in the picogram range. In contrast, RPA offers a simplified system with fewer primers that generally gives results in less than 10 min, which may be a critical time advantage in certain settings like clinical applications. In contrast to LAMP, genomic detection of antimicrobial resistance by RPA is still in its infancy and more progress has been made toward identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms that convey drug resistance.

These b 7 tests are attributed to an RSV infection, however the number of influenza-negative tests that actually tested positive for RSV is unknown. If all specimens had been tested for the same viruses (panel tests), 1/b 7 would correspond to the sensitivity for RSV testing, and the sensitivity for adenovirus and PIV given by 1/b 8 and 1/b 9 respectively. Some laboratories are known to test for viruses sequentially [22] , and so 1/b 7 -1/b 9 were not interpreted as estimates of the sensitivity for other viruses. Sequential testing may occur if a rapid test for influenza is negative and the laboratory then performs PCR or culture testing. Similarly in young children with a respiratory illness in the winter, rapid tests for RSV infection may be performed first, and only specimens with negative results submitted for subsequent testing for influenza or other respiratory viruses [25] . By contrast, many laboratories conduct panel tests for multiple viruses for ease of handling, decreased patient sampling, and recognition that coinfection can occur. Either form of sequential testing would not bias the estimate of sensitivity applicable to test results reported to RVDSS, though significant use of rapid antigen tests in the laboratories reporting to RVDSS would reduce the overall sensitivity. As a single specimen may undergo multiple tests, the false-negative rate applicable to a specimen that has undergone multiple tests would be expected to be much lower than the system average for individual tests.

First, the use of a point-of-care test to detect influenza virus infection, ensuring that the majority of followed-up households will include an index case with laboratory-confirmed influenza (98% in our study), could also preferentially detect those potential recruits with higher viral shedding and subjects with lower levels of viral shedding would be more likely to receive a false negative rapid test results, and not be recruited. However we note that statistical power would be generally increased if index cases were more infectious since we might therefore observe more secondary transmission; the limitation here relates more to generalizability. Secondly, our design results in an unavoidable delay between onset of symptoms in the index subject and the application of the intervention (Figure 2c ). If a significant amount of influenza transmission occurred prior to the intervention, we might have underestimated the efficacy of the non-pharmaceutical interventions or lacked the statistical power to find significant differences. In our analyses we investigated the SARs for those households where the intervention was applied within 36 hours of symptom onset but there was no indication of greater efficacy in this subgroup. Thirdly, there is the potential for recruited households to be biased towards including household contacts with pre-existing immunity, as discussed above. An alternative approach would have been to randomize a much larger cohort of initially uninfected households, who were then followed throughout an influenza season. However such a longitudinal study would require greater resources by several orders of magnitude than the one proposed here, due to the low attack rate of influenza.",32.571672658279326,12.031580608236714

The main drawbacks of virus culture are that it can only detect live viruses and requires more time and higher biosecurity. Immunological methods for testing influenza viruses have low skill requirements, but poor sensitivity and specificity. Recently, many molecular diagnostic approaches such as single or multiplex RT-PCR (including real-time RT-PCR) have been developed for subtyping influenza viruses. However, these methods require expensive thermal cycling equipments. Currently, rapid, reliable and affordable point-of-care tests for influenza virus detection are urgently needed, especially in resource limited regions. In this study, we describe a sensitive mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay for the detection of three influenza A viruses (subtypes A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1) for the first time.

Tests for IgM/IgG [49, 50] cannot detect early-stages of the disease before patients have mounted an immune response. Antibody-based diagnostics detecting Ebolavirus antigens like ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test (Corgenix, Broomfield, Colorado, USA); SD Q Line Ebola Zaire Ag test; (SD Biosensor, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea); Ebola (Senova Immunoassay Systems, Weimar, Germany); OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test (Ora-Sure Technologies, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA) are reasonably easy to operate and offer rapid on-site detection incorporating small quantities of blood or serum as material. However, these antibody based diagnostic methods are not as sensitive as their RT-PCR test counterparts. Thus, currently used reference assays solely detect viral RNA, such as the RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit 1.0 and its improved RealStar Zaire Ebolavirus RT-PCR Kit version, Altona Diagnostics. These RT-PCRs were originally designed for research only and hence mostly include labour-intensive RNA extraction steps, temperature-sensitive reagents, expensive laboratory equipment and the need for manual read-out. Therefore, highly trained staff are making multiple precision steps in sophisticated high containment laboratories to deliver an EVD result with a turnaround time from four to 6 h. In contrast, an automated system integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification and detection of the target sequence using RT-PCR, additionally lowering the risk for technical personnel.

This method could detect 10 ng/ml of pure culture. Sensitivity was high because of the use of biotin-avidin signal amplification method [50] . A new sandwich ELISA based diagnostic study was performed during 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza pandemic. In this ELISA, specific monoclonal antibodies and horseradish-peroxidase linked rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibodies against HA protein were used. This kit was developed by Xiamen University, China. They reported overall sensitivity (0.57) was higher of ELISA than rapid influenza diagnostic kit QuickVue Influenza A+B test (0.43). The sensitivity of both test varied according to the different viral load. It was 100% at high viral load and then decreased with low viral load.

Recently, B·R·A·H·M·S PCT direct, a new high-sensitive point-of-care test, has been developed for fast PCT measurement on capillary or venous blood samples with a measuring range of 0.1 to 10.0 μg/l. Methods This is a prospective, comparative international study conducted in three European EDs. Consecutive patients with suspicion of bacterial infection were included. Duplicate determination of PCT was performed on two distinct B·R·A·H·M·S PCT direct test devices on capillary (fi ngertip) and venous whole blood (EDTA), and compared with the reference method (B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive Kryptor or Elecsys B·R·A·H·M·S PCT, respectively). The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by correlation and concordance analyses. Results A total of 303 patients were included over a 6-month period (60.4% male, median age 65.2 years). The correlation between capillary or venous whole blood and the reference method was excellent: r 2 = 0.96 and 0.97, sensitivity 88.1% and 93.0%, specifi city 96.5% and 96.8%, concordance 93% and 95% respectively at a 0.25 μg/l threshold. No signifi cant bias was observed (-0.04 and -0.02 for capillary and venous whole blood) although there were 6.8% and 5.1% outliers, respectively. B·R·A·H·M·S PCT direct had a shorter time to result as compared with the reference method (25 vs. 147 minutes, diff erence 122 minutes, 95% CI = 110 to 134 minutes, P <0.0001). Conclusion This study found a high diagnostic accuracy and a faster time to result of the PCT direct in the ED setting.

During the past few decades, various methods have been proposed to achieve this, with those based on nucleic acid detection, including PCR and microarray-based techniques, seeming the most promising. These approaches are beginning to rapidly decrease laboratory turnaround times so that results can be available within 2-6 hours compared to perhaps 24 hours.

It is important to bear in mind that in all of the recue assays, the intoxication progress was very fast, since three LD 50 of fresh venom were applied. The strong symptoms of intoxication appeared between 10-20 min after the administration of the venom, contrasting with the 30-60 min required for these symptoms to appear when only one LD 50 was injected. The relevance regarding these results is that some minutes after the administration of scFv 10FG2, the envenoming symptoms decreased notably, disappearing in a period of approximately 30 min, being evident that the animals recovered to a healthy state similar to that of unenvenomed mice. These results strongly support the possibility of simplifying the composition of antivenoms in a significant way, since a single antibody fragment can neutralize different toxins, as well as the whole venoms from several species of related scorpions. So far, demanding rescue tests implemented in mice have shown that the scFv format works as efficiently as the commercial antivenom (unpublished data), with the difference that the amount of antibody administered in scFv format is much lower. Several formats of recombinant antibodies have been generated depending on the different therapeutic purposes for which they have been developed [28] . In the case of the scorpion sting, given its immediate effect, an antidote with an equally rapid effect is required. From our point of view, despite some drawbacks that some authors have attributed to the single-chain format (rapid clarification and low stability), a rapid diffusion of antivenom to neutralize toxins can be critical, especially for children with advanced effects of envenoming.

Preventive performance in finding true positives (i.e., PPV of quarantine combined with rapid diagnostic testing) appeared not to be very sensitive to the length of quarantine (for t > 2 days). This result suggests that if diagnostic test kit supplies are plentiful, then testing should be done early in quarantine. But if a test kit sparing approach is used (i.e., avoiding testing of those who become symptomatic) then there is not much benefit in delaying testing until after day 2 in quarantine. A test with both high sensitivity and high specificity would also allow for better use of resources if the travellers who tested negative are released into the community. Since PPV is mainly determined by prevalence at the source, it should be noted that an exit screening process at the source lowers the prevalence as well as PPV. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of quarantine itself is independent of the prevalence, and moreover, lower prevalence among incoming individuals yields a higher chance of extinction (or greater ripple effect of quarantine (Figures 4 and 5) ). NPV of quarantine combined with diagnostic testing would be extremely high with quarantine periods for lengths of 3 days or longer, supporting our suggestion to release quarantined individuals testing negative to the rapid diagnostic test into the community (if there was high confidence in test performance parameters for the emergent pandemic strain). In light of our findings, island countries may consider including influenza testing capacity and test kit stockpiles in their pandemic plans.

Since our effectiveness measure is conditioned on infected individuals, the risk of releasing infectious individuals in the presence of quarantine with use of rapid diagnostic testing is obtained by multiplying a factor (1-S e ) to r 1 (t) which represents a proportion of cases that are missed even following rapid diagnostic testing.

Vaccines are often still the best approach to control viral infections, often with benefits of lifelong immunity. Even after effective mAb therapies are developed, their widespread application may be impractical due to the high costs of conventional production compared to other countermeasures against disease from viral infections. One way to address the problem of the high cost of mAb therapies is to reduce the cost of production. For instance, production of mAbs in scFv or Fab form or as camelid nanobodies enables relatively inexpensive expression in prokaryotic systems. 152 Another way to address the problem of high costs is financing through partnerships with traditional donors and newer funding sources such as the Gates Foundation. For example, development impact bonds have been tested as a way to eliminate rabies infection in dogs, in turn reducing demand for expensive treatments for humans. 153 A third key challenge is the complexity of pathology, epidemiology, and immunology that can be associated with infection. The way kinetics of infection informs therapeutic strategy, for instance, explains why no dengue mAbs are in clinical trials and why vaccination is the preferred method to control influenza. For dengue and influenza A, symptoms often appear after the peak of viremia; 139, 154 an antibody applied for passive immunotherapy would have to be used before the onset of symptoms to be early enough to avoid viremia. One potential solution is matching a therapeutic antibody with a rapid, point of care diagnostic test. The diagnostic could be used to identify patients with infection and susceptibility to severe disease who would benefit from passive immunotherapy with the therapeutic antibody. Finally, viruses can have complexity that prevents development of a single lasting treatment, for instance multiple strains, rapid evolution, and obscure mechanisms of infection and neutralization escape.",28.331066790994537,11.782823376180517

influenza virus rapid test is its feature allowing the test result to be interpreted by eye on the dipstick,0.23120031565527047,0.3112337589263916,2.013087272644043,9afbbfa6-4ad9-4606-8ea9-4908745e3388,comm_use_subset/Duplex Molecular Assay Intended for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of Influenza A/B Virus Infection,"The novelty of an influenza virus rapid test is its feature allowing the test result to be interpreted by eye on the dipstick. Such visual detection, intended to improve the usability in near-patient diagnosis, might result in diminished test sensitivity if the dipstick signal for a positive sample is not easily distinguishable from that for negative cases by the operator. Stevenson and Loeffelholz reported weak dipstick signal intensity in nearly 43% of the positive pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 samples tested using the QuickVue Influenza AϩB test (38) . The large proportion of weak positive results could adversely affect the overall test performance due to operator-dependent error in identifying the weak signal as positive. The principle of the SAMBA test takes advantage of the explosive accumulation (10 9 -fold increase in 1 to 2 h) of singlestranded amplification product by isothermal amplification in conjunction with the finely adjusted amplification/detection formulation and high yield of viral RNA purification, to achieve an ""all-or-none"" signal profile, i.e., a positive test signal was almost always visibly strong (Ն3 signal) (39) . This all-or-none feature (reflected in the weak correlation between the dipstick signal and C T value, r ϭ Ϫ0.35 and P Ͻ 0.0001) of the SAMBA Flu duplex test greatly minimized the ambiguity of test interpretation. As for the IC signal of the SAMBA Flu duplex test, all negative samples gave a strong IC signal (Ͼ4), although only 29.2% (68/233) of the positive samples gave an IC signal of Ն3. The lower IC signal for the positives could be related to the assay being optimized in favor of the amplification of the influenza virus targets (in order to achieve high test sensitivity). This could be remedied by retitration of input of the IC at the extraction step and/or the IC primer in the amplification mix. Nevertheless, the IC system developed here was effective in indicating true-negative results by giving strong IC signals, and the presence of the IC signal is not required for strong influenza virus-positive cases (a separate negative run was always included to monitor the amplification of the IC). In terms of the turnaround time, the SAMBA Flu duplex test currently takes 2 h and 15 min for the entire test procedure. Compared to other commercial molecular tests that do not have an integrated extraction procedure (which can take 3 to 4 h from extraction to amplification/detection), the SAMBA maintains a competitive advantage (20) (21) (22) (23) . However, other commercial tests designed for point-of-care use have much shorter turnaround times (from 20 min to just over 1 hour) than the SAMBA (33, 34, 40) . This disadvantage could be addressed by reducing the detection and amplification times, which are currently longer than required for the expected test sensitivity, with the objective to reduce the turnaround time to approximately 1.5 h. The SAMBA has a capacity to process four samples in one test run. This throughput makes the SAMBA particularly suitable in the near-patient settings, such as in physicians' clinics, where the sample number is small and a sophisticated testing procedure is not permitted. Although the SAMBA showed good sensitivity for influenza virus typing, the samples would still need to be referred to a centralized laboratory for subtype identification in the case of epidemiological monitoring.",29.60179694095288,11.871437599854291

Rapid and accurate diagnostic testing close to the source is important for the control of outbreaks and detection of emerging influenza viruses. The correlation between the efficacy (31) (32) (33) (34) . These assays simplify the technical manual steps of molecular testing by use of an automated device. Nevertheless, due to the use of real-time PCR technology, these assays require specialized equipment and software for sample processing and data interpretation. The SAMBA Flu duplex test described in this study utilizes isothermal amplification and visual dipstick detection of viral nucleic acid (amplification product) to further reduce the complexity of molecular testing. An internal control based on bacteriophage MS2 was also integrated into the test to monitor the entire test procedure, from extraction to detection. Analytically, the assay was able to detect 95 and 85 copies/test (380 and 340 copies/ml) of influenza A and B viruses, respectively. The SAMBA also demonstrated a promising clinical performance that was comparable to the routine qRT-PCR used in two national reference laboratories (Table 3 ). In addition, the test was shown to be analytically specific against common respiratory pathogens and was found to be reactive to over 20 different subtypes/strains of influenza A/B viruses. In the rare event of influenza A and B virus coinfection, the SAMBA Flu duplex test was capable of detecting both viruses when their viral loads were within a 100-fold difference of each other. Evaluation of a new assay in a blinded manner is directly linked to the validity of the claimed test performance. Indeed, a significant quality concern over rapid tests for influenza virus is their failure to report whether the clinical evaluation was conducted in a blinded fashion (35) . For the clinical evaluation of the SAMBA Flu duplex tests, the clinical samples were tested blind, including the testing of archived samples from WIV-ISP, Belgium. During the 2011-2012 winter in England, influenza virus activity was low, and the H3N2 subtype (A/Perth/16/2009-like virus) was the dominant strain, out-competing both the A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses. For this reason, retrospective archived swab samples, collected by WIV-ISP, Belgium, from 2010 to 2012 (including between-season months), were used to supplement the small number of prospectively collected samples obtained in Cambridge. This ensured that the clinical evaluation of the SAMBA Flu duplex test was not limited to the diagnosis of the H3N2 subtype. In total, the SAMBA test showed promising performance (Ͼ97% sensitivity and specificity for influenza A and B viruses detection compared to the routine qRT-PCR used by two national reference laboratories) in this population of clinical samples. The invalid rate (no IC and test signal and required repeat of the entire test procedure) was found to be 0.3% (1/328). As a comparison, invalid testing due to failure of the internal control was reported to be 5.7% (of 192 samples) for the Prodesse ProFluϩ assay, and 3.5% (of 202 samples) was reported for the for xTAG RVP test (36, 37) .",26.928100350473116,10.786444310387795

Serologic testing was historically the gold standard for diagnosis but suffers from severe limitations that make it both unreliable and impractical for rapid detection. Advances in qPCR technologies have overcome many issues with sensitivity and reliability, but the cost of reagents and requirement for technical expertise are still high, and independent tests must be done for detection and genotyping, limiting diagnosis by qPCR to hospital or advanced laboratory facilities and making it impractical for pointof-care use. We previously established that this NA-SERS biosensing platform is capable of statistically significant detection of M. pneumoniae in true and simulated throat swabs and has a qualitative endpoint of detection for M. pneumoniae of < 1 cell/μl, a sensitivity exceeding that of qPCR [13, 31] . Here, NA-SERS showed statistically significant specificity for M. pneumoniae detection regardless of clinical isolate origin, year of isolation, macrolide susceptibility phenotype, or strain type, and was also able to distinguish all M. pneumoniae clinical isolates and control strains from 12 other human commensal and pathogenic Mollicutes species. Furthermore, NA-SERS discriminated between the two major strain types of M. pneumoniae with a high degree of statistically significant accuracy and correctly identified variant strains as different from the two major genotypes. Most importantly, NA-SERS was capable of detecting and strain-typing M. pneumoniae within a single test and thus has the potential to facilitate tracking epidemiological trends, such as type-switching and outbreak periodicity [12] . Studies with clinical samples are ongoing, and the effect of the presence of a clinically relevant sample background, for example from a patient's throat swab, on the ability of this platform to identify strain types or distinguish M. pneumoniae from other human commensal and pathogenic Mollicutes species remains to be determined. Furthermore, assessment of alternative methods of chemometric analysis to account for the increased number of classes and modeling complexity for species-level discrimination by NA-SERS is necessary. In addition, future clinical application of this technology will require collection of a larger spectral library of isolates and background controls. However, from a point-of-care clinical standpoint, the ability to detect M. pneumoniae rapidly is critical to informing appropriate treatment regimens consistent with the responsible use of antimicrobials. This feature is underscored by the availability of handheld Raman instruments having the potential for point-of-care use [52] [53] [54] . In combination with the minimal sample preparation requirements and expedient detection, NA-SERS shows great promise as a platform for future application to point-of-care M. pneumoniae diagnostics.",27.321246053447872,10.49579160100191

The most parsimonious model, derived from stability selection, used the patient's age, white cell count and platelet count at the time of enrolment to classify dengue from non-dengue cases (Table 3) . Alternative approaches to feature selection yielded models with only slightly higher performance but relied on many more (more than ten) variables (S4 Table) . The most parsimonious model, herein called the Early Dengue Classifier (EDC), had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95%CI: 73.0-76.8%), specificity of 76.3% (95%CI: 75.2-77.6%), positive predictive value of 57.1% (95%CI: 56.2-59.0%), and negative predictive value of 87.8% (95%CI: 86.8-88.5%) for correctly classifying dengue cases in the entire dataset at the pre-defined cut-off of 33.3%. Of note, this pre-defined cut-off reflecting clinical priorities was very close to the cut-off corresponding to the point on the ROC curve closest to the upper left corner (perfect model), which was 34.2% (Fig 1A) . The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.829 ( Fig 1B) and the predicted risk of dengue agreed well with the observed risk ( Fig 1C) . Table. These results suggest that, in settings where NS1 rapid tests are not routinely available, the EDC could assist primary care physicians in dengue diagnosis. In settings where NS1 rapid tests are routinely used, the EDC can be combined with the NS1 rapid test as a composite test (classified as positive when either NS1 rapid test or EDC are positive, and classified as negative when both NS1 rapid test and EDC are negative). This composite test had sensitivity of 91.6% (95%CI: 90.4-92.9%) while the specificity was 75.7% (95%CI: 74.5-77.0%). Corresponding positive and negative predictive values were 61.7% (95%CI: 60.6-63.1%) and 95.5% (95%CI: 94.9-96.1%). If a higher specificity was desired, a higher cut-off value of the EDC could be used for the combined test instead, e.g. a cut-off of 50% would lead to a sensitivity of 86.0% (95%CI: 84.5-87.6%) and specificity of 89.6% (95%CI: 88.7-90.5%). These results imply that the EDC is useful in settings with and without NS1 rapid testing. The nomogram assigns points to all risk factors and translates the total point score to a predicted risk for dengue. For example, a 9-year-old patient with platelet count 100x10 3 /mm 3 , and white blood cell count 5x10 3 /mm 3 has a total points score of 15+32+84 = 131, and the corresponding risk of dengue is about 70%. The predicted risk of dengue is larger than 33.3% so the patient would be classified as dengue positive. Alternatively, the EDC could be implemented as a smartphone app. The exact formula for the estimated risk of dengue (p) is given by the following logistic equation: logit(p) = 1.236 + 0.139 Ã age (in years)-0.254 Ã white blood cell (in 10 3 /mm 3 )-0.006 Ã platelet (in 10 3 /mm 3 ).

For the SeraCare samples (n = 7), only one of the panels became reactive during the sample collection period by the rapid Ab test. This particular sample became rapid Ab reactive 14 days after the first detectable viral load and the first qualitative RNA positive (Table 2 ). In contrast, all of the SeraCare panels were reactive by the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay between 0 and 2 days (median = 0) after the first detectable viral load and qualitative RNA positive. For most panels, both the RT and INT primers detected samples from the same time point; however, in select cases, one primer set detected a sample prior to the other. Based on the viral load data from the panel, the RT primer set detected all of the SeraCare samples in the expected sensitivity range of the assay (> 10 4 RNA copies/ mL) and the INT primer set detected 6 out of 7 of the panels in the expected sensitivity range. In comparison to the laboratory-based tests, the RT-LAMP assay detected members in all seroconversion panels prior to the Ab EIA, and 0 to 7 days (median = 3.5) prior to the Ag + Ab EIA. None of the seroconversion panel members became WB positive during the sample collection period. For the ZeptoMetrix panels (n = 5), the rapid Ab test detected panel members 7 to 29 days (median = 19) post first detectable viral load and the first qualitative RNA positive (Table 3 ). In contrast, the RT-LAMP assay detected panel members within 0 to 5 days (median = 5) post first detectable viral load and qualitative RNA positive, which was 7 to 24 days (median = 15) earlier than the rapid Ab test. Overall, similar reactivity was observed between the RT and the INT primers for RT-LAMP with this panel. In comparison to the laboratory-based tests, the RT-LAMP assay detected panel members anywhere from 2 to 14 days (median = 9) prior to the Ab EIA and 0 to 14 days (median = 2) prior to the Ag + Ab EIA. The RT-LAMP assay was able to detect samples 9 to 29 days (median = 22) before the WB assay. Overall, the RT-LAMP assay detected all of the Zeptometrix panel members within our expected viral load sensitivity range (10 4 RNA copies/ mL). A summary of the HIV-1 test results for these panels, in relation to the first rapid Ab reactive test result is shown in Fig 2.

To implement a successful POC diagnostics programme, the engagement of policy makers, stakeholders and partners to ensure buy-in and align necessary resources is a critical first step. Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes. Another key barrier to the appropriate use of POC diagnostics is the need to train clinicians to create a demand for them and then use the test results to effectively manage the patients.

With RT-PCR, pdmH1N1 influenza virus will test positive for influenza A and negative for seasonal H1 or H3. Meanwhile, commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) detect influenza viral nucleoprotein antigen and are capable of providing results within 30 minutes. The sensitivity of RIDTs for detecting pdmH1N1 influenza varied from 10% to 70% and is directly related to the amount of virus in the specimen but inversely related to the threshold cycle value of the test [27] . Rapid tests for influenza may detect the antigen from either influenza A or B in respiratory specimens with a high specificity (>95%), but the negative result from a rapid test does not rule out influenza infection, and most of rapid tests cannot distinguish pdmH1N1 from H3N2 influenza A viruses [21] .",41.828541386148615,17.280886848576316

The incentive to reinforce infectious diseases surveillance system in Taiwan was that since the severe outbreak of SARS in 2003 the surveillance is performed by sentinel primary care physicians and is based on integrated clinical and virological surveillance components [15] . In addition to the sentinel system, Taiwan CDC has initiated a nationwide laboratory-based virological diseases surveillance system to collect clinical specimens for isolation and identification of influenza viruses.

Diagnostic tests using conventional assays that appear to be negative, even when undertaken late in the disease and despite the clinical diagnosis, have a tendency, at times, to be unreliable. These tests are rarely optimal and entirely dependent on the nature and quality of the sample supplied. In the course of the past three decades, the application of molecular biology has aided in the development of tests that result in a more rapid detection of rabies virus. These tests enable viral strain identification from clinical specimens. Currently, there are a number of molecular tests that can be used to complement conventional tests in rabies diagnosis. Indeed the challenges in the 21st century for the development of rabies diagnostics are not of a technical nature; these tests are available now. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: firstly, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test that will then lead to its acceptance by organisations globally. Secondly, the areas of the world where such tests are needed are mainly in developing regions where financial and logistical barriers prevent their implementation. Although developing countries with a poor healthcare infrastructure recognise that molecularbased diagnostic assays will be unaffordable for routine use, the cost/benefit ratio should still be measured. Adoption of rapid and affordable rabies diagnostic tests for use in developing countries highlights the importance of sharing and transferring technology through laboratory twinning between the developed and the developing countries. Importantly for developing countries, the benefit of molecular methods as tools is the capability for a differential diagnosis of human diseases that present with similar clinical symptoms. Antemortem testing for human rabies is now possible using molecular techniques. These barriers are not insurmountable and it is our expectation that if such tests are accepted and implemented where they are most needed, they will provide substantial improvements for rabies diagnosis and surveillance. The advent of molecular biology and new technological initiatives that combine advances in biology with other disciplines will support the development of techniques capable of high throughput testing with a low turnaround time for rabies diagnosis.",26.57431116629074,11.171281198908392

Although this study design allows for reliable influenza VE estimates, non-specific immunity induced by influenza infection may have an effect on the estimates [6] . It has been hypothesised that influenza infection induces a short-term, non-specific immunity and reduces the risk of subsequent NIRV infections. Therefore, people who are vaccinated for influenza and are less likely to be naturally infected with influenza may be at a higher risk of NIRV infections [6, 7] .

The culture is the gold standard for diagnosis but requires 18-24 hours of incubation at 37°C, causing a delay in identification of GABHS. This delay in diagnosis often leads physicians to administer therapy without first knowing the etiological agent, causing an overuse of antibiotics that provokes a rising in the diffusion of drugresistant bacterial strains. RADTs allow the identification of GABHS on a throat swab in a matter of minutes. This strategy has a significant impact on reducing the antibiotic prescription [10] . The tests are based on nitrous acid extraction of group A carbohydrate antigen from organisms obtained by throat swab. The specificities of RADTs are generally high while sensitivities vary considerably [4] .

Furthermore, other underlying conditions may impair residents' abilities to verbalise their symptoms.

Novel and recombinant strains of influenza viruses have caused pandemics resulting in millions of deaths. The rapid detection of these viruses is essential for a medical response and infection control [1] . A low-cost and rapid identification of influenza types and subtypes in clinical patients is essential for initial clinical treatment and avoidance of antibiotic misuse, as well as prevention of influenza virus transmission, especially in resourcelimited regions [1] . Molecular assays are highly sensitive and specific for detecting influenza viruses such as rapid immune colloidal gold diagnostic tests, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and viral culture. Nucleic acid based tests for respiratory viruses are currently used as a rapid and sensitive diagnostic approach for clinical specimens. A cost-effective, accurate and rapid multiplex assay is highly desirable in clinical virology laboratories for testing and diagnosing common and emerging viruses. Even though the multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of respiratory viruses, such assays are limited to a maximum of four multiplexed targets, and the high cost of reagents and equipment involved is particularly limiting for laboratories with low financial constraints [2] . Therefore, a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) technology was developed to solve these problems. The DPO primer contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker, which assumes a bubble-like structure not involved in priming, but which delineates the boundary between two regions of the primer [3] . This structure confers distinct annealing properties on the two primer segments. The longer 5′-segment initiates stable priming, while the short 3′-segment determines targetspecific extension [3] . The advantage of DPO based PCR is the blocking extension of non-specifically primed templates under less than optimal PCR conditions [3] . DPO technology was commercialized and used in many recent studies to test different respiratory viruses [3] . Additionally, several studies have compared DPO based multiplex PCR with other rapid methods for the detection of influenza viruses. The results suggested that the DPO based multiplex PCR system had a higher sensitivity and specificity than the other methods tested [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, most of these recent studies, including those using commercial DPO based rapid detection kits, tested numerous different respiratory viruses or different types of influenza viruses. Only one commercial kit (Seeplex® Influenza A/B OneStep Typing, Seegene, Seoul, Korea) can simultaneously detect influenza A, B and subtypes of influenza A including 2009 pandemic H1 and Human Seasonal Influenza A (H1 and H3). Recently, the live poultry market has posed a high risk for human infection following the avian infection in Beijing, China [8] . The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was identified in local poultry and wild birds is enzootic in China [8] . Therefore, it is important to develop a rapid and simple method to detect avian influenza viruses.

Additionally, it offers important advantages over bulk or large-scale analysis including rapid assay results, high-throughput screening, and low consumption of reagents. Further, the energy required for microfabrication and operation is remarkably reduced. Most importantly, these benefits make microchip systems amenable to near-patient and point-of-care testing. The development of DNA amplification microinstruments began in the 1990s, when the concepts of integrated microfluidic devices were introduced to take advantage of microfabrication technology for biological and chemical analyses [2] .

Consequently, HDA has been employed with an embedded lateral-flow DNA detection strip for end-point assay to detect HIV-1 in human plasma [84] . The principle of this approach is based on a sandwich immunoassay using two probes: a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled capture probe and a biotin-labeled detection probe. The HDA products hybridize with the capture probes and detection probes to form the complex. The hybrids are bound to streptavidin-conjugated color particles and are captured on the test zone by the interaction between the target DNA-FITC capture probe and an anti-FITC antibody. The accumulation of color beads in the test zone of the fiberglass paper is visualized as a characteristic red band. This assay provides the satisfactory detection of HIV-1 RNA at 50 copies/assay. This disposable amplicon detection device based on HDA has also been applied to the herpes simplex virus [85] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis diagnosis [86] and shows a performance comparable with conventional detection assay.

It should be rapid, sensitive, specific, stable at high temperatures (>30°C), and cheap. Currently point-of-care DENV detection is carried out with RDT assays. RDTs are simple and rapid but of limited sensitivity and specificity [7, 13] . Real-time RT-PCR is highly sensitive, usually performed in highly equipped laboratories and not suitable for point-of-care testing. In contrast, RPA technology is as sensitive and specific as real-time RT-PCR, isothermal and easy to use at point-of-need [26, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .

In high burden TB countries nucleic acid based TB tests have been restricted to centralised laboratories and specialised research settings. Requirements such as a constant electrical supply, air conditioning and skilled, computer literate operators prevent implementation of such tests in many settings. Isothermal DNA amplification technologies permit the use of simpler, less energy intensive detection platforms more suited to low resource settings that allow the accurate diagnosis of a disease within a short timeframe. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is a rapid, low temperature isothermal DNA amplification reaction. We report here RPA-based detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) DNA in ,20 minutes at 39uC. Assays for two MTC specific targets were investigated, IS6110 and IS1081. When testing purified MTC genomic DNA, limits of detection of 6.25 fg (IS6110) and 20 fg (IS1081)were consistently achieved. When testing a convenience sample of pulmonary specimens from suspected TB patients, RPA demonstrated superior accuracy to indirect fluorescence microscopy. Compared to culture, sensitivities for the IS1081 RPA and microscopy were 91.4% (95%CI: 85, 97.9) and 86.1% (95%CI: 78.1, 94.1) respectively (n = 71). Specificities were 100% and 88.6% (95% CI: 80.8, 96.1) respectively. For the IS6110 RPA and microscopy sensitivities of 87.5% (95%CI: 81.7, 93.2) and 70.8% (95%CI: 62.9, 78.7) were obtained (n = 90). Specificities were 95.4 (95% CI: 92.3,98.1) and 88% (95% CI: 83.6, 92.4) respectively. The superior specificity of RPA for detecting tuberculosis was due to the reduced ability of fluorescence microscopy to distinguish Mtb complex from other acid fast bacteria. The rapid nature of the RPA assay and its low energy requirement compared to other amplification technologies suggest RPA-based TB assays could be of use for integration into a point-of-care test for use in resource constrained settings.",31.653225677524073,13.351883381664676

The present findings confirm previous reports that have shown that detection of a viral respiratory pathogen in a large part of the pediatric patients did not influence a change in antibiotic management of individual patients [15, 28] . This may be attributed to the young age of the children, severity of clinical symptoms and the general attitude of clinicians to complete antibiotic treatment in children due to concern about bacterial co-infections and development of antibiotic resistance. Identification of viral pathogens can be of importance for both individual patient management and hospital infection control policy. Rapid diagnosis could contribute to a significant reduction in unnecessary laboratory tests and costly imaging, especially in young children, thereby decreasing diagnostic costs. Bonner et al.

In general, RADT sensitivity is strongly dependent on high viral load of respiratory specimens and therefore performs best in young infants with classical symptoms of RSV bronchiolitis. A pooled RADT sensitivity of 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76% to 83%) was reported for pediatric patients (4) . In our screening population of children Ͻ18 years of age who were hospitalized with any symptom of respiratory tract infection, we observed RADT sensitivity of 63% (95% CI, 55% to 72%) compared to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (5), while in adults, sensitivities of different RADT were Ͻ25% (6). As an alternative to RADT, rapid nucleic acid amplification assays have been developed to facilitate early recognition of RSV infection. These assays provide high sensitivities but require a testing time of at least 1 h (7, 8) . The Alere i system is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test which utilizes a nicking enzyme amplification reaction. The platform technology was previously developed for the detection of influenza virus (Alere i influenza) and provides test results in less than 15 min. The test is optimized for point-of-care settings and does not require specific training or experience in laboratory techniques. A number of studies have evaluated this rapid influenza test in comparison to both viral culture and RT-PCR, reporting sensitivities between 45 and 100% (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Recently, the platform has been extended with test cartridges for the detection of streptococcus A (Alere i Strep A) and RSV (Alere i RSV). Both assays are being introduced into routine clinical care. No data have been published regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the novel Alere i RSV test. The objective of our study was to evaluate the performance of the Alere i RSV test for rapid detection of RSV in children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection.",57.07955349601873,20.13498678931245

Front,"On the other hand, less than satisfactory results were also reported in studies that evaluated the impact of rapid tests or immunofluorescence assays, although marketed preparations have been shown to exhibit sensitivity and specific higher than 90% (Vos et al., 2019) . A Cochrane Review (Doan et al., 2014) that analyzed four studies regarding the impact of rapid viral diagnosis in children admitted to the Emergency Department reported that the only advantage of the rapid diagnosis was a lower rate of chest radiography (relative risk [RR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.91). No effect on the length of the visit or blood or urine testing was demonstrated. Moreover, a trend toward decreased antibiotic use was demonstrated, but the difference between the tested and untested children was not significant. The knowledge that a bronchiolitis case was associated with the detection of RSV in the nasopharyngeal secretions did not lead to any advantage. Children with positive results from the rapid test received similar blood tests and radiological examinations. Moreover, although the children who tested positive had a more severe disease, virologic testing for RSV did not identify children at risk. Globally, the rapid test for RSV is considered useless, and this attitude explains why the test is not recommended by several experts (Ralston et al., 2014) . The only rapid test for a single virus that seems to positively impact physician attitudes and have a satisfactory effect on antibiotic consumption the clinical course of disease is the rapid test for influenza. Several years ago, Esposito et al. (2003) showed that children with a positive rapid influenza test were significantly less likely than those with a negative test or no test to undergo routine blood examinations (2.3% vs. 14.5% and 15.0%; p = 0.045 and p = 0.038) or receive antibiotics (32.6% vs. 64.8% and 61.8%; p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003). Children with positive tests also tended to have a lower incidence (although not significant) of chest radiographs (4.6% vs. 11.5% and 11.7%) and a lower likelihood of admission (0% vs. 4.6% and 5.8%). Similar results were reported more recently by Cantais et al.

Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes.

Unfortunately, this approach clashes with the second event, which is the advent of molecular-based microbiology that can identify the causative pathogen rapidly at the point of care. The urinary antigen is a most effective rapid test that has allowed targeted therapy for Legionnaire disease at the point of care. The high specificity (> 90%) allows the clinician to administer appropriate anti-Legionella therapy based on a single rapid test; however, its low sensitivity (76%) means that a notable number of cases of Legionnaire disease will go undiagnosed if other tests, especially culture, are not performed. Further, culture for Legionella is not readily available. If a culture is not performed, epidemiologic identification of the source of the bacterium cannot be ascertained by molecular fingerprinting of the patient and the putative source strain.

Although T. vaginalis infection is not a reportable disease in the United States, it is the most prevalent nonviral STI in the United States. 147 T. vaginalis infection may present as vaginitis in women and urethritis in men; however, it is frequently asymptomatic. Infection with T. vaginalis may also cause additional adverse health outcomes, including PID in women, as well as infertility and increased incidence of HIV transmission in women and men. Current recommendations for T. vaginalis diagnosis and treatment can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/default.htm and available diagnostic tests range from simple microscopy to NAATs. Microscopic examination of vaginal fluid or urethral discharge for T. vaginalis (wet mount) in the clinic is the most commonly used test. It has low sensitivity (51% e65%) but with experienced observers can be highly specific. 148 Culture has long been considered the gold standard test, but it requires special medium and 5 days to complete. However, recent studies indicate that the sensitivity of culture may be as low as 75% to 96%. 148 Pap tests are not suitable for routine screening or diagnosis because of low sensitivity. 149 There is a single rapid antigen test for T. vaginalis (OSOM, Sekisui Diagnostics) that is FDA cleared for use as a point-of-care test for female patients. Test specifications include sensitivity of 82% to 95% and specificity of 97% to 100%. 150 The Affirm VPIII Microbial Identification test is an FDAcleared test that uses nonamplified NA probes to detect three organisms associated with vaginitis: T. vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Candida albicans.

If the patient leaves their physician or healthcare facility with a prescription for antibiotics, the treatment would then begin before the microbial entity is known. In the age of emerging drug resistance, unnecessary antimicrobial agent use must be avoided. Because untreated GABHS infection may have serious consequences for the patient, rapid detection methods for S. pyogenes were developed to give nearly immediate results in order to make the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis possible while the patient is still in the office or clinic. There are several manufacturers of rapid identification test kits for GABHS in the marketplace today.=, 47, 52 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed 25 published studies that examined the sensitivity of these rapid identification test kits. 18 They found the sensitivity of these tests ranged from 62% to 100%. Within any one institution, the sensitivity of a single kit varied by as much as 20%. Assuming that a good diagnostic screening test should have a sensitivity of at least 95% (so almost all infected patients will be detected), this study showed that a negative rapid identification test for GABHS cannot accurately rule out infection, and that a corresponding culture also is needed. 18 In a national survey, the College of American Pathologists (CAP) sent 2692 laboratories a swab seeded with S. pyogenes to perform a rapid detection test with the kit used at their institution. Fourteen different types of GABHS kits were assessed. The number of correct results ranged from 80% to loo%, with only three kits providing 100% accuracy for all participants. Those using these three kits comprised only 11% of the users. Based on this survey, and similar performance on previous CAP surveys, both the CAP and CDC recommend that a negative test result generated by a rapid identification test for GABHS must always be followed with a culture. This also is the current recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics. A useful approach is to collect two throat swabs, one for rapid testing and the other for culture. If the antigen test is positive, the second swab for culture is not needed. If the antigen test is negative, the second swab should be used to perform the culture.

IgM assays have generally not been useful. Serologic testing provides retrospective diagnosis when a у4-fold increase in a specific antibody is detected by complement fixation or EIA. Because rhinovirus has 1100 serotypes, serologic testing is impractical for diagnosis, whereas serologic tests for detection of hMPV and coronavirus are only available in research settings. Because of overlapping clinical syndromes, diagnosis of viral pneumonia requires laboratory confirmation. This is particularly important for influenza, because treatment is available and infection-control issues arise in hospitals and nursing homes (figure 1). Therefore, during the winter months, we recommend screening by rapid antigen tests for patients who are admitted to the hospital and residents of long-term care facilities who have suspicious clinical syndromes. Once influenza is active in the community, we recommend screening all patients with pneumonia with rapid tests, followed by influenza culture if the results of the rapid test are negative. Full respiratory viral cultures and RT-PCR are desirable to identify other viral pathogens, but if resources are limited, these tests may be restricted to immunocompromised or severely ill patients, for whom use of unproven therapies is sometimes attempted. Because of its retrospective nature, serologic testing is more useful for investigation of nursing home outbreaks of respiratory disease rather than for individual patient care.",31.44942267872159,12.779772154967413

Numerous kits are available that use techniques such as agglutination and enzyme immunoassay to detect GABHS carbohydrate in a matter of minutes.

Thus, it is recommended that a negative rapid test be confirmed with a throat culture. However, findings show that with a positive rapid test, it is reasonable to start antibiotic treatment without performing a bacterial culture. These recommendations are particularly important when treating children.

Primers were validated using influenza-positive samples from unvaccinated patients, packaged FMV, and one PCR-positive asymptomatic vaccine.

Analytical and clinical validations show that the assay is both sensitive and specific. Experimental results demonstrate that 51 out of 51 influenza-positive samples collected during influenza season from ill, previouslyvaccinated military personnel represent real infections with circulating strains. Finally, the assay shows that four preseason influenzapositive samples were false positives resulting from vaccine shedding. The vaccine-discriminatory RT-PCR methods described here provide the first test designed to distinguish FMV strains from circulating strains.

Therefore, for the 1:800 scale detailed test, the approaching wind profiles were adjusted accordingly to maintain the shapes of the profiles and fit the similarity theory (as shown in Fig. 10 ). Since two different scale models were used in this study, wind speed scaling factors were introduced to ensure the consistency of wind speed between these two wind speed profiles. The wind speed scaling factor was derived as respectively. The reference wind speed was determined as the averaged mean wind speed measured at 9 heights in the two scale model tests.

The shortcomings of these rapid EIA tests have been well described, so they will only be covered in generalities here, as follows. Firstly, while the specificity of the tests is generally acceptable, so a positive result in association with the appropriate clinical picture is useful, the sensitivity of rapid tests that do not amplify the target depends on the amount of the viral antigen present in the clinical sample, and a negative result cannot be used with confidence. Given their low sensitivity, additional testing is required to detect low-level positives missed by rapid EIA tests. Rapid tests have only been developed for influenza and RSV while often the need is to rule in or rule out a wider variety of respiratory viral pathogens not detected by rapid tests. In some virology labs a rapid test is often used as a first step and EIA-negative specimens are tested by DFA and if negative by shell vial culture (SVC) or traditional culture to broaden the spectrum of viruses that can be detected.

Performing the test in the clinic can avoid the delay of sample transportation and the bottleneck of batching in centralized laboratories. 9e11",28.13251185937204,11.865834381016267

Ideally, the screening test should have 100% specificity, 100% sensitivity, and 100% positive predictive value (PPV). Manufacturers provide information on the accuracy of screening tests produced. The computation of the values to assess a screening test was presented in chapter ""Descriptive Epidemiological Methods."" Criteria that should be considered when choosing a screening test follow principles presented in chapter ""Epidemiological Study Another approach to evaluating the accuracy of a screening test is to prepare a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This graphical technique is used when test measures are ordinal and the outcome (disease) measure is nominal, a likelihood ratio (LR) for each level of the test is computed and the area under a ROC curve is used to assess criterion validity. An ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) vs. the false positive rate (1-specificity) for each level of the test. The test level where an LR of 1.0 is exceeded is defined as the threshold for positivity or the cut point at which the value for the test will significantly predict the outcome. Statistical software is available to easily construct LRs and ROC curves using statistical software such as SPSS Inc.'s Predictive Analytic Software portfolio (http:// ww.spss.com). The greater the area under the curve (AUC), the greater is the accuracy of the test measure in predicting the outcome represented by AUC = 1, perfect prediction and where AUC = 0.5 is random prediction.

However, in adult ILI patients with false-negative rapid-screening influenza A tests (RIDTs), there was great diagnostic difficulty in categorizing patients from a clinical and epidemiologic perspective, i.e., adults admitted with suspected H1N1 pneumonia were placed on influenza precautions and given oseltamivir. 2, 3 Early in the pandemic, single/negative-pressure rooms were quickly filled, and it became increasingly critical to devise a clinical diagnostic approach that would differentiate ILIs from the probable H1N1. When it was appreciated that RIDTs were frequently false negative, we used respiratory fluorescent antibody (FA) viral test panels to try to increase diagnostic accuracy. Respiratory FA viral tests had the additional value of detecting not only influenza A and B but other respiratory viruses presenting as ILIs, e.g., metapneumoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and adenoviruses. Unfortunately, respiratory FA viral test results did not correlate well with results from RIDTs. In most cases, if a rapid influenza A test was positive, the respiratory FA viral panel was also positive for influenza A. However, when a rapid influenza A test was negative (which presented the most difficult diagnostic problem), the respiratory FA viral panel test was not frequently negative as well. When both the rapid influenza A screening test and the respiratory FA viral test were positive for influenza A, the results were highly predictive of a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for H1N1.",57.46020187378813,20.013214932921638

Cunha, MD, Uzma Syed, DO, Stephanie Stroll, MD, Nardeen Mickail, MD, and Marianne Laguerre, MD BACKGROUND: In spring 2009, a novel strain of influenza A originating in Veracruz, Mexico, quickly spread to the United States and throughout the world. This influenza A virus was the product of gene reassortment of 4 different genetic elements: human influenza, swine influenza, avian influenza, and Eurasian swine influenza. In the United States, New York was the epicenter of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic. Hospital emergency departments (EDs) were inundated with patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) requesting screening for H1N1. Our ED screening, as well as many others, used a rapid screening test for influenza A (QuickVue A/B) because H1N1 was a variant of influenza A. The definitive laboratory test i.e., RT-PCR for H1N1 was developed by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) and subsequently distributed to health departments. Because of the extraordinary volume of test requests, health authorities restricted reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Hence most EDs, including our own, were dependent on rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) for swine influenza. A positive rapid influenza A test was usually predictive of RT-PCR H1N1 positivity, but the rapid influenza A screening test (QuickVue A/B) was associated with 30% false negatives. The inability to rely on RIDTs for H1N1 diagnosis resulted in underdiagnosing H1N1. Confronted with adults admitted with ILIs, negative RIDTs, and restricted RT-PCR testing, there was a critical need to develop clinical criteria to diagnose probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia.",53.96173205536178,19.758548763080682

CRP levels become markedly elevated in the presence of a clinically significant acute bacterial infection and, as such, CRP measurement can play a role in the diagnosis of such infections; however, CRP is not considered to be sufficiently specific as a marker on its own to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . MxA is an intracellular GTPase protein that is induced by type I and type III interferons [27] and which serves as a sensitive and specific marker for viral infection [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . MxA has antiviral activity against a broad range of pathogenic viruses, and interferon production in response to viral infection leads to an increase in MxA levels [27] . The rationale behind the FebriDx test is that through measurement of CRP and MxA together, it can combine the sensitivity of CRP with the specificity of MxA such that, when used together in a rapid point-of-care test, these markers can serve to aid in the differentiation between viral and bacterial ARIs [16] .",30.102222793033743,12.5362941478251

The main diagnostic difficulties in diagnosing H1N1 pneumonia were based on a high number (e.g., 30%) of false-negative tests with rapid influenza A screening tests. With one third of hospitalized adults having negative rapid influenza tests, it quickly became clear that a method was needed to provide a clinical presumptive diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia. 4,6 A presumptive clinical diagnostic method was also critical in ruling out mimics of swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia, e.g., exacerbations of asthma, chronic bronchitis, and CHF, as well as bacterial CAPs, e.g., legionnaire's disease. 7, 9, 10 A clinical presumptive diagnosis was also essential in determining which patients should be placed on influenza precautions and treated with oseltamivir. Criteria were also important for discontinuing influenza precautions and oseltamivir therapy in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs who did not meet the clinical diagnostic criteria. Because of restrictions on RT-PCR testing, a clinical diagnosis for negative RIDT patients was both operationally and clinically critical in the early phases of the H1N1 pandemic. 4, 6, 7 To apply our criteria, all hospitalized adults in the ED had CBCs, serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT), and serum CPKs.

There are clear advantages of adopting an immunoswab assay in a clinical and primary healthcare setting. First, the ease of use and detection of highly infective strains of virus could help in rapid detection and potentially isolating patients, mitigating the spread of infection. An immunoswab assay could be utilized as a simple, rapid point of care diagnostic test at all ports of mass human entry (airports, seaports, bus, train and border stations). Since the testing time is rapid the use of immunoswab-based SARS-CoV detection during an outbreak will not unnecessarily cause inconvenience to the passengers or delay their travel plans. If successful, this type of assay can reduce the unprecedented paranoia associated with such outbreaks involving people traveling across the globe. This type of test can also be used in populated centers as well as in areas where adequate health care is not available. The other main advantage of this test is its low cost/low tech approach. The use of immunoswab also does not require complicated technology or highly qualified staff to perform the test. Any social worker with some minimal training can use this test in a primary healthcare or rural setting. It will not be a heavy burden to people in underdeveloped countries or developing countries who have to invest in costly procedures such as RT-PCR in case of large outbreaks. This assay is particularly useful in parts of the world where lack of technology can be an impediment in detecting SARS-CoV infection before further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be procured. The immunoswab detection of NP can also set a precedent for detection of other viral and bacterial diseases such as avian influenza and tuberculosis.

Firstly, it decreases the overall turnaround time in the busy winter months. While a 1-2 hour time saving may not seem like much, having a result available within this timeframe means that the test is much more likely to be used for real-time clinical decisionmaking in the context of a busy emergency department or outpatient setting. It facilitates the rapid diagnosis of influenza and RSV, which would hopefully translate into earlier administration of antiviral therapy, which has significant therapeutic benefit (Aoki et al., 2003) , and could decrease use of unnecessary antibiotics. In addition, it could mean earlier initiation of appropriate infection control precautions and reduced secondary transmission. This effect will be amplified when applied across many patients. Secondly, it not only maximizes diagnostic accuracy for influenza, but also detects many other respiratory viral pathogens that can be clinically indistinguishable from each other. This provides both patients and clinicians with the clarity of a definitive microbiologic diagnosis and reassurance that a favorable prognosis is likely without the need for antibiotics. Furthermore, due to differences between transmission characteristics between respiratory pathogens, CDC guidelines for isolation precautions differ for each diagnosis (Siegel et al., 2007) . Identifying the specific pathogen may increase the likelihood that the appropriate precautions are implemented, reducing nosocomial transmission. Finally, it facilitates increased testing volumes within existing laboratory technician time constraints, and does not require input from the ordering clinician, who may not be familiar with the nuances of the different respiratory viral tests available. Using the Sofia® as a laboratory-based test rather than a true point-of-care test does increase turn-around time somewhat (minimal in locations with on-site laboratories and rapid specimen transport systems), but obviates the need to train non-laboratory based staff and maintain instruments outside the diagnostic laboratory.",34.989950346720235,14.242184002916222

Respiratory viral infections can span the clinical spectrum from no symptoms to death in rare cases. Children under the age of 5, and especially those under 2 years of age, are at high risk for complications from influenza, resulting in thousands of hospitalizations and approximately 100 to 150 deaths per year. 8 RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children under 1 year of age, causing 60,000 hospitalizations in children each year. 9 Traditionally, viral culture was the gold standard for respiratory virus detection, but because of the long turnaround time, rapid antigen testing became the mainstay for influenza and RSV testing in the ED and outpatient settings. Just like rapid antigen testing for GAS, testing for influenza and RSV is rapid and inexpensive, but lacks sensitivity at 50% to 70%. For this reason, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has discouraged the use of rapid antigen testing for influenza and RSV and promoted the use of molecular detection of these viruses. If rapid antigen testing must be used, the CDC recommends using these assays only when the prevalence of influenza or RSV in the community is greater than 10%, which raises the positive predictive value of the assay. Even when the prevalence is high, clinicians must interpret rapid antigen test results with caution, because a negative result does not exclude infection in a symptomatic patient. 10 Like GAS testing, second-generation rapid antigen assays using a reading device have been developed to increase the sensitivity of influenza and RSV detection. A study of 240 pediatric specimens tested on 3 second-generation influenza platforms, the Veritor System Flu A 1 B (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD, USA), Sofia Influenza A 1 B FIA (Quidel Corp, San Diego, CA, USA), and BinaxNOW Influenza A&B (Alere Scarborough, Inc, Scarborough, ME, USA), found testing to be in agreement 93.8%, 94.2%, and 95.8% of the time for influenza A and 98.1%, 79.2%, and 80.8% of the time for influenza B, respectively, compared with real-time PCR. 11 Assays using molecular methods of influenza and RSV detection have drastically increased the sensitivity of viral detection over previous methods, including rapid antigen testing and viral culture. The increased speed of detection is partially due to removal of an external extraction step before molecular testing, allowing testing platforms such as the Simplexa An exciting new development in the field of influenza and RSV detection has been the development of rapid, point-of-care molecular testing. These assays combine the quick New Developments in Rapid Diagnostic Testing turnaround time of rapid antigen testing with the high sensitivity and specificity associated with molecular testing. Several of these assays are CLIA waived and can be performed at point of care by non-laboratory-trained individuals. Although molecular assays cost more than traditional rapid antigen assays, they provide accurate test results while patients are being seen in clinic or in the ED, allowing treatment decisions to be made while the patient is in house. A study of 545 specimens (85% collected from children) found the Alere i Influenza A&B assay to be 99.3% sensitive and 98.1% specific for influenza A, and 97.6% sensitive and 100% specific for influenza B, compared with viral culture and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR used for discrepant analysis. 12 A study of 2 CLIA-waived, point-of-care, molecular assays, Cobas Liat Influenza A/B (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and Alere i Influenza A&B (Alere Scarborough, Inc, Scarborough, ME, USA), tested 129 respiratory specimens (41% pediatric specimens).

Several diagnostic platforms and tests have great potential to improve management of respiratory tract infections. 26, 27 Furthermore, these are becoming increasingly important in response to outbreaks of respiratory tract infections caused by zoonotic pathogens, which jump the species barrier and have epidemic potential. [28] [29] [30] Several commercial diagnostic tests and platforms that incorporate the above technologies and promise to substantially reduce turnaround times for diagnosis of a host of microbial infections, including those of the respiratory tract, are on the market or in development (table 2) . Typically, these are on automated or semiautomated systems or kits that integrate sample preparation, pathogen detection, and identifi cation of antimicrobial resistance genes, providing an automated read-out of results. These tests and platforms are the most advanced systems requiring the least possible user input throughout the process and are capable of detecting several pathogens simultaneously. Depending on the test, single or multiple pathogens, or antimicrobial resistances may be detected. Such systems can off er not only an improved speed of diagnosis but also increased sensitivity of detection. However, the development of such tests and their successful implementation into clinical practice requires further development. [31] [32] [33] Where the accuracy of results is high with multiplex tests, the desirable characteristics for providing both diagnostic and epidemiological information become convergent, and routine diagnostic laboratories can consider fulfi lling a public health role. 34 Molecular multiplex tests need to be transported outside the laboratory as point-of-care tests in busy tertiary care, outpatient clinical settings, or rural areas in developing countries. From this point, the basic requirements of a method may diverge: for fi eld studies, the adopted amplifi cation technology may need to be something more suited to situations where power supply cannot be guaranteed, such as isothermal amplifi cation.

These assays use a reading device to interpret the assay rather than the naked eye, which increases the sensitivity of antigen detection and reduces the subjective nature of reading low positive test results. In a study of 48 pediatric patients with pharyngitis, the Sofia Strep A 1 FID (Quidel Corp, San Diego, CA, USA) was 88.9% sensitive and 93.3% specific for detection of GAS compared with culture. 2 Illumigene group A Streptococcus assay (Meridian Bioscience Inc, Cincinnati, OH, USA) uses isothermal amplification for detection of GAS and was found to be 100% sensitive and 95.9% specific compared with culture in a study of 437 throat swabs collected from primarily pediatric patients (98% of patients <18 years of age). 3 A second study of 361 pediatric patients reported the Illumigene assay to be 98.6% sensitive and 96.5% specific. 4 For comparison, traditional GAS rapid antigen tests were also run on all specimens in both studies and had a sensitivity of 73.3% and 55.2%, respectively, and specificity of 89.1% and 99.1%, respectively. The Simplexa Group A Strep Direct Assay (DiaSorin Molecular LLC, Cypress, CA, USA) was found to be 97.4% sensitive and 95.2% specific compared with culture in a study of 1352 specimens across 4 pediatric testing sites. 5 Molecular tests have also been developed that allow rapid, point-of-care detection of GAS. These assays are highly sensitive and specific and may not require reflex to culture if testing is negative. Many of these tests are also Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waived, which allows molecular testing to be performed by nonlaboratory personnel, such as physicians and nurses in an outpatient or ED setting.

In a study conducted across 10 US medical centers, 481 primarily pediatric specimens were tested by nonlaboratory personnel and found the Alere i strep A assay to be 98.7% sensitive and 98.5% specific compared with bacterial culture. 7 In the past few years, there has been an explosion in the field of GAS assays. These new assays are rapid, have increased sensitivity over traditional rapid antigen tests, and in many cases, can be performed at point of care. Because molecular testing is more sensitive than culture, clinicians must be cognizant to only test patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis to prevent detecting GAS colonization. Molecular testing does not distinguish between live or dead organisms, so molecular tests cannot be used to determine clearance of GAS following treatment. Testing for GAS by molecular methods can result in the missed opportunity to detect less common causes of bacterial pharyngitis such as Lancefield groups C and G b-hemolytic streptococci, which are identified by throat culture. In an effort to identify additional bacterial causes of pharyngitis, some assays such as the Simplexa Group A Strep Assay detect Lancefield groups C and G b-hemolytic streptococci in addition to GAS.

Late disease occurs >10 weeks later and is also termed latent syphilis. This form can ultimately lead to tertiary syphilis presenting as further neurologic dysfunction, including tabes dorsalis, dementia, and general paresis (Read and Donovan, 2012; Clement et al., 2014) . Serologic testing with Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin is the gold standard for screening. Regarding the VDRL, although estimated specificity is high, sensitivity is lower, which is a major limitation of the test. The method for both the serum and CSF VDRL tests requires specialized glass plates and a light microscope. For CSF testing, the cardiolipin-lecithincholesterol antigen is diluted and a smaller volume of the antigen suspension is used compared to serum, adjusting for the much lower concentration of immunoglobulin in CSF compared with blood. In contrast to the VDRL test, the rapid plasma reagin test for plasma or serum incorporates carbon particles, which enables the test to be performed on a disposable paper card and read with the naked eye, rather than a microscope (Marra et al., 2012) . The main limitations of nontreponemal tests are their reduced sensitivity in primary syphilis and late latent syphilis, and false-positive results due to cross-reactivity. After a positive initial screening, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test or T. pallidum particle agglutination can be used to confirm infection (Janier et al., 2014) .",31.852799218986295,12.88316245350525

[130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] There is a need to improve our understanding of the role of individual microorganisms in respiratory disease and the true relationship between pathogen quantity and disease. A major challenge of implementation of molecular testing technology will be the ability of the test to distinguish between microbial colonisation, Series infection, and disease causation. Standard laboratory culture generally incudes a quantitative element, with a usual cut-off being 10⁵ CFU/mL. Respiratory tract specimens are invariably contaminated with colonising organisms from the nasopharynx and the increased sensitivity of molecular techniques will detect such colonisers. Additionally, multiple pathogenic species can be present in one specimen. The extent to which these represent genuine co-infections as opposed to a mixture of infection and colonisation needs to be determined. The diffi culty in distinguishing between infection and colonisation creates a dilemma as to whether such results should be used to guide treatment. Incorporation of a quantitative element to diagnostics, such as use of quantitative PCR will go some way towards improved interpretation. At present, the biggest technology gap exists within the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and these are now the focus of consortia partnerships funded by the EU and the Innovative Medicines Initiative such as PATHSEEK, 76 rapid identifi cation of respiratory tract infections (RiD-RTI), 140 and development of rapid pointof-care test platforms for infectious diseases (RAPP-ID). 141 The aim of the RiD-RTI consortium is to develop a rapid sample-in, answer-out nucleic-acid-based platform for the diagnosis of all types of pneumonia (community acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and ventilator associated pneumonia) caused by viral and bacterial pathogens 140 while RAPP-ID proposes to use various technologies to develop point-of-care tests for infl uenza, ventilator associated pneumonia, and community acquired pneumonia. 141 ",34.38037855647323,12.09505073555123

The burden of nosocomial influenza can be high, incurring additional costs for diagnostic tests, increased morbidity, and extended hospitalization [17, 18] . Therefore, rapid diagnostic tests are needed to identify patients with influenza at admission, in order to prevent nosocomial transmission by facilitating isolation and cohorting decisions [18] . Studies have documented substantial nosocomial transmission of hMPV in pediatric units [20] , as well as in chronic care facilities [21] , similar to what is seen with RSV. During the height of RSV season, many institutions must cohort RSV-positive children because of a lack of private rooms. However, dual infections with RSV and hMPV do occur. Limiting diagnostics to RSV alone in a cohorting scenario could put other seriously ill children at risk for acquisition of a second viral infection with hMPV. The meaning of mixed viral infections can be defined only if testing is comprehensive. Broad test panels also allow for monitoring the epidemiologic patterns of respiratory disease and for identifying new or reemerging pathogens.

In these assays (Fig. 1) , a membrane strip serves as the solid support that carries a surface-immobilized antigen line or spot for target capture. The strip is also impregnated on one end with a loosely bound detection molecule conjugated with dyes or nanoparticles (such as colloidal gold). As a fluid sample is placed on the sample pad, the detection molecule binds to the target antibody in the sample, and the complex is carried forward to the antigen line/spot by capillary force. Binding of the target antibody to the antigen on the capture line then leads to a visible color change.

Direct pathogen detection is traditionally performed by light microscopy, although antigen detection and nucleic acid amplification tests (such as polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are increasingly used. Pathogen detection may also be carried out by isolation of the microorganism by culture of relevant clinical samples, and this allows susceptibility testing to be performed. Methods based on detecting the immune response mainly rely on detecting pathogen-specific IgM or IgG antibodies. Technological advances in the design of testing methods have simplified antigen and antibody detection to the point that simple point-of-care test kits are now widely available.

Currently, there are a number of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived molecular tests for Influenza virus, some paired with respiratory syncytial virus, group A Streptococcal pharyngitis and for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/NG) with excellent analytical sensitivity and specificity [51, 52] . CLIAwaived means that these tests can be performed outside of a laboratory and by non-laboratory staff such as nurses. Studies of these platforms have shown clinical impact for influenza detection in both the inpatient and ambulatory settings [53, 54] . In a prospective, single-season study of urgent care centers connected to their health system, Benirschke et al. found a significant reduction in the use of antibiotics for those who tested positive for influenza by a POC molecular test compared to those who tested positive by a POC antigen test [54] . Martinot et al. had similar significant reductions in length of stay, antibiotic administration, and faster oseltamivir administration after a positive influenza test in an emergency department population comparing POC molecular to a slower laboratory developed molecular influenza test [55] . Group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis POC molecular tests are now CLIA-waved without the need for confirmatory culture of negative results. In a prospective primary care study comparing a CLIA-waved POC molecular test to conventional methods for GAS, Rao et al. found a small but significant reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use for children presenting with symptoms of GAS pharyngitis [56] . For CT/NG, the majority of these tests are currently sent to central laboratories, leaving up to a 7-day waiting period from first visit to treatment. During that time, patients may spread infection, and many patients receiving positive results do not return for treatment. These POC tests allow people to be tested, diagnosed, and treated for STIs in a single visit [57, 58] . They can also help to reduce the burden on health workers and systems and can therefore also reduce expensive laboratory costs.",27.007324638832095,11.074117315812876

For Lyme borreliosis, molecular diagnostics may not possess the solution when too few or no Borrelia are present. For HME, the issues lie in the realms of clinical practice, public health, and business. Physicians who are unaware of HME and note that febrile illnesses during the tick season often respond to doxycycline therapy are not inclined to order send out tests that would cost the patient. Serology that is based on comparing IgG antibody levels in paired sera often fails to provide a diagnosis of acute infection as it relies on the seldom-obtained convalescent serum. Public health agencies are powerless to address effectively a disease that is not diagnosed, and if diagnosed, is not reported. The epidemiologic reports depend on the data obtained by passive surveillance. In fact, active, prospective, population-based surveillance in endemic regions such as Missouri suggested that HME is a highly prevalent disease [96] . The combination of nonspecific clinical manifestations of HME, test underutilization, lack of a gold standard test that is effective when therapeutic decisions are made, and problems in interpretation of diagnostic tests such as serology, and misleading epidemiologic data have accounted for reported low incidence of HME.

Culture on Sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) agar and biochemical identification, while easy to use and inexpensive, is slow and lacks sensitivity in the detection of non O157:H7 serotypes. This study sought to determine the accuracy of rapid serological or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays which have been evaluated for the detection of all EHEC serotypes compared to culture. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 146 articles, identified via searches of electronic databases, hand searching of selected journals, and through contact with experts and commercial test manufacturers. The majority of these needed to be excluded due to low quality or lack of accuracy data. Sensitivity and specificity of each method was calculated using full biochemical identification as the reference standard. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 7 used PCR methods and 10 used serological assays and 4 were based on culture. A summary receiver operator curve (SROC) was constructed from these data and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated (using the trapezium rule). Results: Serological tests had individual sensitivities ranging from 0.82 to 1.00 and specificities ranging from 0.67 to 1.00. PCR tests had individual sensitivities ranging from 0.94 to 1.00 and specificities ranging from 0.92 to 1.00. Additional analysis comparing SMAC agar culture with toxin detection methods showed poor sensitivity compared to PCR and serological tests (ranging from 0.24 to 0.38) yet the specificity was very good (1.00 for all 4 studies considered).",24.79302039289178,9.839027327202713

Survival studies result in clear data sets, but death as an end point is often not allowed by Animal Care and Use Committees, with ethical questions arising concerning the humane care and use of animals for survival studies. Many institutional committees now require euthanasia of the animals prior to death from disease. The criteria for euthanasia must be evaluated carefully on an individual basis, since subjective judgments can skew the data (i.e., euthanizing animals too soon makes the infection appear more severe that it truly is). Thus, criteria for euthanasia have to be as quantitative as possible, applied objectively and reproducibly to ensure accuracy, and the judgements on individual animals made without knowledge of their study group, wherever possible.

Early antigen detection assays were enzyme immunoassay-based utilizing membrane-bound capture antibodies and several incubation/washing steps. 3, 7 Compared to viral culture, early studies suggested sensitivities of the antigenbased methods of between 64% and 78%. 20 Today, antigenbased testing has evolved into rapid, low-complexity, selfcontained devices utilizing predominantly immunochromatographic methodologies. Advantages of these rapid influenza detection tests (RIDTs) include quick turnaround time (often less than 30 minutes) and ease of use. These features allow many of these assays to be offered as point of care testing devices. At the time of preparation of this manuscript, more than 15 RIDTs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 21 Although these assays are convenient, a significant drawback of RIDTs is a lack of sensitivity. Various studies have demonstrated that the sensitivity of rapid antigen detection assays ranges from 50% to 80%. 3 There are several reasons for this suboptimal analytical performance characteristic. One factor is that the sensitivity of rapid antigen detection is inherently dependent on the amount of viral antigen present in clinical samples, often requiring 10 4 to 10 6 infectious particles. 22 Adults shed less virus compared to infected children, and thus it is not surprising that the sensitivity of rapidantigen detection tests for respiratory viruses in general are greatly reduced in adults compared to children. 23 Another factor contributing to the variable analytical performance characteristics of rapid antigen tests is the variation in the influenza strains themselves, which was best illustrated with the 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus. A Centers of Disease Control study evaluating three different antigen assays demonstrated a 40% to 69% sensitivity for the 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus compared to sensitivities ranging from 60% to 83% for strains circulating previously. 24 These findings were supported by other studies, including a New York study citing an astonishing sensitivity of only 9.6% for the detection of 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus by a commonly used rapid antigen detection test. 25 While a lack of sensitivity can lead to difficulty in interpreting negative results, problems with specificity make positive results equally challenging to interpret. A small 2010 study of 45 specimens positive by RIDT demonstrated that 17 (37.8%) were actually false positives. 26 A second study during the same year compared 336 RIDT results to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results obtained from specimens tested at several different facilities. This study demonstrated an alarming RIDT specificity of 48.1% when compared to PCR. 27 Despite these limitations, the appeal of a rapid, pointof-care diagnostic leads to the continued use of these assays in many settings. Following the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus pandemic, a survey of hospital laboratories revealed that 84% continued to use RIDTs. 28 Novel RIDTs are continuously in development, and efforts have been made to address concerns regarding sensitivity. One such recently developed assay, the BD Veritor System Flu A þ B (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD), is a digital immunoassay that is purported to have improved sensitivity compared to other RIDTs. Comparative studies have demonstrated superior performance of this assay compared to other commonly used RIDTs using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as a gold standard. [29] [30] [31] However, the BD Veritor's estimated sensitivity of 89.6% is still below that of RT-PCR. 29 ",31.523966352418817,12.330484627779837

There are clear advantages of adopting an immunoswab assay in a clinical and primary healthcare setting. First, the ease of use and detection of highly infective strains of virus could help in rapid detection and potentially isolating patients, mitigating the spread of infection. An immunoswab assay could be utilized as a simple, rapid point of care diagnostic test at all ports of mass human entry (airports, seaports, bus, train and border stations). Since the testing time is rapid the use of immunoswab-based SARS-CoV detection during an outbreak will not unnecessarily cause inconvenience to the passengers or delay their travel plans. If successful, this type of assay can reduce the unprecedented paranoia associated with such outbreaks involving people traveling across the globe. This type of test can also be used in populated centers as well as in areas where adequate health care is not available. The other main advantage of this test is its low cost/low tech approach. The use of immunoswab also does not require complicated technology or highly qualified staff to perform the test. Any social worker with some minimal training can use this test in a primary healthcare or rural setting. It will not be a heavy burden to people in underdeveloped countries or developing countries who have to invest in costly procedures such as RT-PCR in case of large outbreaks. This assay is particularly useful in parts of the world where lack of technology can be an impediment in detecting SARS-CoV infection before further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be procured. The immunoswab detection of NP can also set a precedent for detection of other viral and bacterial diseases such as avian influenza and tuberculosis. These diseases have a similar route of air borne infection as SARS-CoV and also shed antigens into body fluids. Anti-NP/anti-HRPO BsMAb immunoswab assay for detection of SARS-CoV.

For example, the test could be conducted as the first line of rapid public diagnoses, to select those who must take the more expensive and elaborate, but more accurate, PCR test. Only those tested positive by RDT must be required to do PCR test. Meanwhile, those tested negative, must take the test multiple times, up to at least three times, after an interval of 5 to 7 days, considering the incubation period of the virus. Also, because the result of this test will be very useful not only for global COVID-19 countermeasures, and for the private sectors producing the test kits, Indonesia must negotiate her position so that she will also benefit from using the RDT kits. searching the antibody of COVID-19), with recommendation that negative results must be repeatedly retested by the same method over time, and positive results retested by PCR. These emphasize that rapid tests should be viewed mainly to implement broader surveillance and epidemiological studies, in order to understand how broad, the virus infection has spread in Indonesia (PDS PatKLIm, circular 19 March 2020). However, such data must be handled very carefully, since a recent report has suggested that such rapid tests using RDT are only 30% accurate (Baker et al, 2020).",29.51153174167623,11.008002700721347

Figure 13 shows snapshots of the vector field (ũ p 0 ,ṽ p 0 ) in Tests A-1 (left frame) and A-4 (middle frame) att = 1.0 and A-5 (right frame) att = 0.72, whereũ p 0 := (ũ p 0 ,ṽ p 0 ,w p 0 ). The propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-4 is slightly lower than that in Test A-1, whereas the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-5 is markedly higher than that in Test A-1. As a result, the increase in ξ yields the slight increase in the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains owing to the increase in the collision frequency, because the majorant collision frequency [30] is determined using 1 <Ẽ max in the DSMC calculation. Additionally, the increase inθ yields the increase in δu p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains, which leads to more rapid propagation of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-5 than that in Test A-1. ig. 14 Snapshots ofp att = 1.0 in Tests A-6 (upper-left frame) and A-1 (upper-right frame), and at t = 1.536 in Tests A-6 (lower-left frame) and A-1 (lower-right frame) uals with the large velocity, who determine the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains, increases, asθ increases. Actually, we can confirm that the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains depends on not δũ but δũ p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains from Figs. 7 and 13. The increase in δu p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains owing to the increase inθ can be explained by the fact that D increases in accordance with the increase inθ due toD ∝θ ξ/2 in Eq. (14) . Meanwhile, K 01 also increases in accordance with the increase inθ , when ξ > 0. Thus, it is still open problem whether the increase in the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains via the increase inθ is caused by the increase in D or K 01 in Eq. (23) . Meanwhile, the description of the relation between δũ and δũ p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains is set as our future study. In Fig. 13 , we find that δu p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains tend to be lager than δu p 0 inside the infected domain. Such a tendency indicates that the virus tier is correlated to the velocity of the individual such as f ( p, v) C ( p, v) ) is the correlation function).",25.012386578762882,9.719985934054378
a smallτ m yields the rapid local epidemic spread via the binary collision between the infected and uninfected individuals,0.21132986700633546,0.0101728904992342,1.2966541051864624,6d7cdff1-939a-414b-840d-37165d8758fe,custom_license/Kinetic Modeling of Local Epidemic Spread and Its Simulation,"whereθ is the temperature, which is averaged during some time interval. Figure 8 shows snapshots ofp in Tests A-1, A-2 and A-3 att = 1.0 (upper frames) and t = 1.536 (lower frames). Figure 8 shows that there are not marked differences between contours ofp in Test A-1 and those in Test A-2 att = 1.0 and 1.536, whereas there are marked differences between contours ofp in Test A-1 and those in Test A-3 att = 1.0 and 1.536, because the infected domain never spreads concentrically in Test A-3. From Eq. (24), we can conjecture that δũ 2 in Test A-1 is a half of that in Test A-2 and 1/10 times of that in Test A-3, becauseθ is fluctuating around 5 at 0 ≤t in Tests A-1, 2 and 3. The dependency of the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains on δũ is ignorable, because there are no marked differences among the area of the infected domain in Test A-1 and those in Tests A-2 and A-3 att = 1 and 1.536, as shown in Fig. 8 . Consequently, the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains strongly depends on the collisional term G p 0 in Eq. (7), in other words, K 01 in Eq. (23) . Next, we investigatef (τ ) := V 3f t,x, p (τ ) ,ṽ dv 3 . We set τ = 0.02 in the range of 0 ≤τ ≤ 2.f (τ ) is the set of simple functionsf ( τ × i) (i ∈ Z + ) on Lebesgue measurẽ τ ∈ i × τ , (i + 1) × τ ). Then, 0 ≤τ ≤ τ includes both uninfected individuals and infected individuals, whose elapsed time is in the range of 0 ≤τ ≤ τ . Figure 10 shows in Test C occur more frequently than that does in Test B, because the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test C is lower than that in Test B. Consequently, the range ofτ , which yieldsf (τ ) = 0, namely, sum of Lebesgue measure, which yieldsf (τ ) = 0, becomes the longer, asτ m becomes the longer. In summary, the ratio of the number of individuals, who are infected at other lattices (domains), to the total number of infected individuals at the specific lattice (domain) decreases, as τ m decreases, because the local epidemic spread occurs inside the lattice rapidly via one or a few of invasions of the infected individuals from neighboring lattices, before some infected individuals reach to neighboring lattice, because the virus titer increases rapidly inside the lattice owing to small τ m from Eq. (2). Figure 12 shows the sample particles (individuals), which are calculated using the DSMC method, in Test C (att = 0.6) and Test A-1 (att = 0.88). A sphere corresponds to one individual, where the diameter of a sphere is expressed with enlarged Fig. 12 . Consequently, we confirm that a smallτ m yields the rapid local epidemic spread via the binary collision between the infected and uninfected individuals, once a infected individual invades to the outside of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains. Thus, the infected individual with the large velocity becomes a seed of the local epidemic spread, which will be confirmed in the discussion of δu p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Fig. 13 . Consequently, such a higher velocity of the infected individuals at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains attributes to the finite diffusion flux from Eq. (14) at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains.",24.78400698754921,9.523839992837924

(1) inside the domain U att = 0, whereas individuals inside the domain X − U, who have p = 0 att = 0, are uninfected. The schematic of the calculation domain (X) is shown in Fig. 5 (Table 1 ). Figure 6 shows the time evolution ofp in Test A-1. The infected domain spreads at 0 ≤t ≤ 1.0, concentrically, where the center of the concentric spread is, certainly, X ,Ỹ = (0.5, 0.5). Atτ m = 1.0 in Eq. (1), p of the individual, who is infected att = 0, reaches to unity atτ = 1. Consequently,p increases toward X ,Ỹ = (0.5, 0.5) and reaches to 0.895 at X ,Ỹ = (0.5, 0.5) att = 1, where we remind thatp is not equal to unity at t = 1, because individuals, who are infected att > 0 and have p (τ ) < 1 owing toτ < 1, (1) must be damped to zero, rapidly, before the interaction with the uninfected individuals. Such a situation can be obtained by using p (τ c ) 1 (τ c : inverse of the averaged collision frequency), whenτ m <τ c . Next, we investigate the effect ofτ m on the local epidemic spread by considering Test B. Figure 7 shows the time evolution ofp in Test B. The infected domain spreads, concentrically in a similar way to Test A. The propagation speed ofp in Test B is higher than that in Test A-1. From Eq. (7), the propagation of the infected domain depends on the spatial propagation via ∇ x ρ 0p0 δu p 0 and generation of ρ 0p0 via G p 0 . We remind thatp is related (1) rather than the increase in δu p 0 , because our numerical results indicate that δũ p 0 t at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-1 is similar to that in Test B. Such a similarity between δũ p 0 t at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-1 and that in Test B indicates that D in Test A-1 is similar to that in Test B. In short, the difference between the propagation speed of the boundary domain between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-1 and that in Test B is caused by the relation K 01 | Test A-1 K 01 | Test B as a result of Eq.

Early diagnosis of influenza can reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics, provide the option of using antiviral therapy and is an important infection prevention measure. The causative agent of ILI is difficult to determine on the basis of signs and symptoms alone. Sensitivity and predictive value of clinical definitions vary, depending on the prevalence of other respiratory pathogens and the level of influenza activity. Among generally healthy adults living in areas during the peak of influenza activity, the positive predictive value (PPV) of a simple clinical definition of influenza (acute onset of cough and fever) can be over 80%. However, the presentation in children, the elderly, and individuals with comorbidities is less likely to be typical, in which case the PPV of clinical impression can be as low as 17À30% in these populations [73] . Dagnostic testing is not needed for all patients with ILI to make antiviral treatment decisions once high levels of influenza activity have been identified in the region. For most outpatient and emergency room settings, results for molecular assays are generally not available to assist in clinical decision making. Fortunately, that paradigm is changing with advent of rapid tests which provide a wide panel of results in approximately 1 h, or 20-min point-of-care devices for influenza.

If a nontreponemal test is being used as the screening test, it should be confirmed, as a high percentage of false positive results occur in many medical conditions unrelated to syphilis. When both test results are reactive, they indicate present or past infection. However, for economic reasons, some high-volume clinical laboratories have begun using automated treponemal tests, such as automated EIAs or immunochemoluminescence tests, and have reversed the testing sequence: first screening with a treponemal test and then retesting reactive results with a nontreponemal test. This approach has introduced complexities in test interpretation that did not exist with the traditional sequence [174] . Specifically, screening with a treponemal test sometimes identifies persons who are reactive to the treponemal test but nonreactive to the nontreponemal test. No formal recommendations exist regarding how such results derived from this new testing sequence should be interpreted, or how patients with such results should be managed. To begin an assessment of how clinical laboratories are addressing this concern, CDC reviewed the testing algorithms used and the test interpretations provided in four laboratories in New York City [174] . Substantial variation was found in the testing strategies used, which might lead to confusion about appropriate patient management. A total of 3664 (3%) of 116 822 specimens had test results (ie, reactive treponemal test result and nonreactive nontreponemal test result) that would not have been identified by the traditional testing algorithms, which obviate additional testing if the nontreponemal test result is nonreactive. If they have not been previously treated, patients with reactive results from treponemal tests and nonreactive results from nontreponemal tests should be treated for late latent syphilis.",32.29822754180902,11.971598128181107

Immunochromatographic-based urinary antigen tests are rapid, simple-to-perform assays that can be easily developed as point-of-care patient tests. Further development is dependent on defining new antigens that can be readily detected. Molecular diagnostic techniques are becoming increasingly popular in clinical microbiology laboratories. Many of these combine sensitivity, specify, and rapid turnaround time to allow timely patient care. With the development of these methods, the clinical microbiology laboratory is no longer reliant solely on the conventional culture methods for detection of pathogens. Molecular methods have created new opportunities for the clinical microbiology laboratory to affect patient care in the areas of initial diagnosis and therapy. Over time, the methods have become more automated and the potential for clinical utility increased. In addition to providing excellent new tools for diagnosis, molecular tests will also serve useful roles in infection control and public health. 55 A critical issue regarding the clinical utility of the molecular tests will be the turnaround time. If we are to be able to use these tests for point-of-care diagnosis, it will be optimal to have results within 1 or 2 hours. However, even if the turnaround time is longer, they can still be useful for more appropriate antimicrobial therapy by allowing earlier pathogen-directed or discontinuation of therapy. Moreover, there will be the question of 24/7 availability. Will smaller community hospitals be able to rationalize the added cost of equipment and personnel to run these tests in a timely manner? In addition, the issue of laboratory reimbursement needs to be addressed, as the current reimbursement by CPT code does not adequately cover the cost of many molecular tests (of course if the test results can result in downstream lower total cost of care by shortening illness and length of stay, these costs can be justified).",34.65727566155206,13.778710078352132

Confirmation of influenza virus infection is not required for clinical decisions to prescribe antiviral medication. The decision to administer influenza treatment or chemoprophylaxis should be based on clinical illness and epidemiologic factors, and the start of therapy should not be delayed pending results, especially during an influenza outbreak. 51 Influenza diagnostic testing is not clinically indicated when test results will not alter a patient's clinical care or influence clinical practice for other patients (Fig. 1) . A positive influenza test may be used to confirm influenza virus in the community, which may affect clinical practice related to home care guidance, hospital infection control practices, future testing practices, and so forth. Neither the rapid influenza test nor clinical prediction rules were superior to clinical judgment alone in the diagnosis of influenza. In one study of 258 patients with 21% confirmed influenza, the overall clinical judgment had a sensitivity of 29% (95% CI, 18%-43%) and specificity 92% (95% CI, 87%-95%), which improved to a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI, 39%-86%) and specificity of 96% (95% CI, 81%-99%) when patients presented within 48 hours.

To follow this adage, it is even more important nowadays that a continually increasing number of diagnostic tools is becoming available at the point of care. That should, however, not be interpreted as it has been for years with malaria microscopy, as an invitation to disregard test results and treat diseases presumptively based on clinical elements with low sensitivity and/or specificity [195] . This adage rather suggests that, because no diagnostic test is 100% perfect, their results do not provide a black-orwhite answer, but rather an indication on the disease probability. This probability depends on two factors: (i) the prevalence of the disease in the corresponding patient population (pre-test probability), and (ii) the performance (positive and negative likelihood ratios) of the test used. When a disease is rare in the population (low pre-test probability) even if the test has a reasonable accuracy, the post-test probability after a positive result remains low. For example, if a typhoid rapid test with 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity (and thus, a likelihood ratio (LR) of 0.8/(1-0.8) = 4) is used in an area of Asia where prevalence of typhoid fever among patients with febrile illness is 20%, the post-test probability will be 50% (it can be calculated using Fagan's nomogram [196] ), which suggests that it is reasonable to implement an antibiotic treatment to that patient. If the same test is used in an area of Africa where the prevalence is 2%, the post-test probability will only be 7.5%, which hardly justifies treating the patient for typhoid but rather to consider alternative diagnoses.",31.93343621872044,12.758253852861738

A second component of the microbial forensics is careful examination with the goal of attribution since encoded in the concept is a law enforcement application. In addition to the chapters in this book, there are several outstanding reviews which address the requirements and gaps in current bioforensics for human and plant biothreats [1] [2] [3] . One major difference in the application of forensic assays for public safety and for law enforcement is the requirement for speed and specifi city. Assays which impact public safety must be rapid and be suitable for presumptive diagnostic purposes. Presumptive diagnostics are those which are used as an adjunct to clinical tests and to assist the physician in patient evaluation.

A routine analysis of recombination detection in influenza is to test for phylogenetic incongruence (e.g., using the AUtest) between regions identified by some recombination detection programs. It is often seen that a large set of diverse sequences or even all available homologs were tested for phylogenetic incongruence. Since homologous recombination would likely occur between closely related strains, it is important to know whether the presence of distantly related sequences affects the performance of the incongruence test. Specifically, I sought to address whether the choice of taxa that are not involved in recombination affects the successful detection of homologous recombination. Three lineages (P1, P2, and R) were simulated in 100 iterations as per Fig. 5C and, additionally, two outgroups were introduced with three different scales (1×, 2×, and 5×) for the branch length between the two outgroups and the P1, R, P2 lineages. The AU-test was then performed in each condition using the middle of the sequence as the break point, and the number of iterations that failed in recombination detection was counted (Fig. 6) . When the branch length between the outgroups and the P1, R, P2 lineages was 1×, 2 out of 100 iterations failed to show significant phylogenetic incongruence. When the branch length between the outgroups and the P1, R, P2 lineages was increased to 5×, 19 iterations failed to show significant phylogenetic incongruence. In other words, the results reveal that, with the exactly same set of sequences involved in recombination, using distantly related outgroup sequences could lead to a poorer performance of recombination detection using phylogenetic methods. Unfortunately, many published homologous recombination studies in influenza searched for incongruent phylogenetic signals from data sets of very diverse sequences. It is possible that some genuine recombinant sequences might have been overlooked by analyzing diverse sequences. Hence, the best way to detect homologous recombination using phylogenetic methods is to analyze the putative recombinant, parental sequences, and their close relatives and to avoid distantly related sequences that are not involved in recombination. It is important to note that, in the simulation, the AU-test was performed on the actual simulated breakpoint, which is usually unknown. The accuracy of recombination detection of the AU-test and other similar phylogenetic methods is therefore dependent on the successful detection of recombinant sequences and the successful identification of recombination breakpoints.",22.269136906658638,8.96861046438243

The mucosal immune system in the gut must eliminate potential pathogens while maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship with the commensal microbiota. Antibodies derived from the secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) class, act as the first line of antigen-specific immunity in the gut by recognizing both pathogens and commensals. Therefore, the measurement of SIgA levels is an important index in evaluating PEDV infections and immune status. A simple and rapid method for the detection of PEDV-specific SIgA using an immunochromatographic test strip has been developed; incorporating a colloidal gold-labeled anti-SIgA secretory component (SC) mAb probe for the detection of anti-PEDV-specific SIgA in swine.

Materials and methods: Epidemiological records of all community outbreaks of legionellosis reported to the Department of Health of the Generalitat of Catalonia (6.3 million inhabitants), Spain, excluding those of nosocomial origin, during the period 1990-2003 were studied. An epidemic outbreak was considered as the appearance of two or more epidemiologically-related cases of legionellosis. Descriptive variables were recorded for each outbreak and a comparative analysis made of outbreaks occurring between 1990 occurring between and 1996 occurring between (period I) and 1997 occurring between and 2003 . v 2 test was used to compare qualitative variables. Results: Ninety outbreaks were studied. The origin was determined solely by epidemiological data in 47 (52.2%), and by epidemiological data and molecular biology in 6 (6.7%). The origin could not be determined in the remaining outbreaks. Cooling towers were involved in 34.4% of the outbreaks. The annual evolution of the number of outbreaks has been progressively greater from 1990 with a clear increase from 1999 onwards. 71.1% of the outbreaks occurred in the period June-October. The total number of people affected in all 90 outbreaks was 558 and the median number affected per outbreak was 3 (range 2-113). The average age of those affected was 57.3 years (SD 10.8) . Hospitalization was required in 463 (82.9%) cases and 27 people died (global case-fatality rate 4.8%). The outbreaks during period I were smaller, the average age of patients was higher and the outbreak was detected later. The case-fatality rate was significantly higher in period I than in period II (12.2% versus 4.1%). In period I, the diagnostic methods used were BCYE and serology, whereas 97.1% of the outbreaks in period II were diagnosed by the urinary antigen test. Conclusion: In Catalonia, the number and size of LD outbreaks has risen clearly from the 1990s to the present. However, the beginning of the outbreaks was detected sooner and the case fatality rate has fallen significantly.

Since the development of antiviral drugs and treatment options available for viral infections, clinicians are encouraged to seek viral laboratory diagnosis that can provide clinically useful information in diagnosis and management of patients. This required the focus of laboratories to shift to providing better, faster diagnosis, which has driven the development of new approaches to monitor viral infections and to support antiviral treatment through: quantitative viral loads, antiviral susceptibility testing, viral genotyping and, point-of-care testing.

As we move increasingly toward rapid testing using nonculture techniques like PCR, phenotypic tests become less practical because they require more time because the microbe must be grown. Alternatives, such as identifying the presence of a gene that causes resistance, can be used if the gene is known. Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to penicillin is known to be caused by variations in penicillin binding proteins. A PCR-based test that assessed these variations would have content validity, because penicillin is known to bind to bacterial cell walls at the site of penicillin binding proteins. If presence of mutations in binding proteins correlates with resistance phenotype, then the test would have construct validity. Finally, if variants in penicillin binding proteins predict resistance based on a phenotypic test, the measure would have criterion validity. Although nonculture techniques show great promise for rapid detection of antibiotic resistance for many organisms -meeting all three types of validity -they have some disconcerting limitations. Phenotypic tests for antibiotic resistance detect resistance regardless of mechanism. A PCR-based test is limited to a specific genetic mechanism of resistance. Thus, if not all mechanisms of resistance are included in a test or a new mechanism emerges, the test will be incapable of detecting that the bacterium is resistant. Further, a mechanism may be present and not active because the gene is degenerate, there is a missing regulator, or there is some other reason.

On the basis of our study, overall, the mPCRs exhibited reasonable sensitivity (0.940; 95% CI, 0.902e0.964) and high specificity (0.987; 95% CI, 0.979,0.992) for FluA. In current clinical practice, the immunoassay-based rapid influenza diagnostic test is most widely used for screening influenza infections [8] . Although the rapid influenza diagnostic test can detect FluA and FluB in respiratory specimens in approximately 15 to 30 minutes, its sensitivity is limited, as reported by a previous meta-analysis [32] . This may give false-negative results, which prevents its use as a reliable excluding diagnostic tool in clinical practice. Furthermore, commonly used reference standards such as RT-PCR or virus culture may take several days to yield results and have little value for treatment decision. Our meta-analysis showed that mPCRs provide highly accurate results in a clinically relevant time frame and may potentially change the current diagnostic and treatment practice for FluA infection. As a result of the low sensitivity of the rapid influenza diagnostic tests, the decision of antiviral treatment for FluA infection is largely based on clinical grounds alone [5] , which may lead to overprescription of anti-influenza drugs and increasing drug resistance [33, 34] . A study by Van Wesenbeeck et al. [25] of 171 clinical samples concluded that FilmArray RP and Prodesse ProFluþ have better sensitivity for FluA than Verigene RVþ. This is contrary to our results, which found the three mPCRs to be comparable for FluA detection. Our meta-analysis synthesized data across different studies encompassing 5510 patient samples and may present a more accurate estimate of the real situation. Although these three systems have comparable accuracy for FluA, FilmArray RP has the shortest hands-on time (2 minutes) and run time (1 hour) among the three mPCRs and includes sample preparation in its panel. Furthermore, its reagents can be stored at room temperature, and its assay detects the largest number of targets. Therefore, FilmArray RP may be the best choice in emergency rooms or during the influenza season.",32.687711300161055,12.390339401957691

Methods: A comprehensive search up to 1 July 2017 was conducted on Medline and Embase for studies that utilized FilmArray, Verigene RVþ and Prodesse for diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. A summary of diagnostic accuracies for the following five viruses were calculated: influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were used for estimating the viral detection performance per assay. Results: Twenty studies of 5510 patient samples were eligible for analysis. Multiplex PCRs demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) equal to or more than 0.98 for all the above viruses except for adenovirus (AUROC 0.89). FilmArray, Verigene RVþ and ProFluþ (the only Prodesse assay with enough data) demonstrated a summary sensitivity for FluA of 0.911 (95% confidence interval, 0.848e0.949), 0.949 (95% confidence interval, 0.882e0.979) and 0.954 (95% confidence interval, 0.871e0.985), respectively.

This can be done using agglutination or lytic tests, with lytic tests regarded as more reliable. 743 The hemolytic crossmatch of mare serum with foal red blood cells using exogenous complement is considered the test of choice. Identification of the specific red blood cell factors involved can also be accomplished by testing panels of red cells that represent all the known blood groups. 741 Despite their limitations, agglutination tests are commonly used because they are more readily performed and provide more rapid results. A crossmatch of mare serum with foal red blood cells without the addition of exogenous complement has agglutination rather than hemolysis as the endpoint and is less sensitive than the hemolytic crossmatch. The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test can be used to demonstrate the presence of antibodies on the surface of the foal's red blood cells, but this test can lack sensitivity. The most readily performed test is the jaundiced foal agglutination (JFA) test, which is simple and provides rapid results. The JFA test is performed using red blood cells from the foal and colostrum from the mare, with agglutination as the endpoint. Unfortunately the JFA test can lack both sensitivity and specificity and is most useful in prevention of NI rather than diagnosis of an affected foal.",25.792606285171885,10.807050156429423

A recent report supported the traditional cutoff value of >800 mg/dL as indicative of adequate transfer of passive immunity (ATPI) and found that in a large population of hospitalized foals values <800 mg/dL were proportionally associated with mortality. 165 This study also reported a regression equation that could be used to estimate serum IgG concentration from serum TP, albumin, and globulin concentrations with good diagnostic performance (IgG = −241. 165 This estimation may be helpful in situations where specific testing for serum IgG concentration is not readily available.",26.939699531097908,10.074366852069788

As learned from past incidents, the detrimental impact grows exponentially without effective quarantine. Therefore, rapid on-site detection and analysis are highly desired. In addition, for high-risk areas of viral contamination, close monitoring should be provided during the potential disease incubation period. As the epidemic progresses, a response protocol needs tobe rapidly implemented and the virus evolution fully tracked. For these scenarios, point-of-care microdevices can provide sensitive, accurate, rapid and low-cost analysis for a large population, especially in handling complex patient samples, such as blood, urine and saliva. Blood plasma can be considered as a mine of information containing sources and clues of biomarkers, including nucleic acids, immunoglobulin and other proteins, as well as pathogens for clinical diagnosis. However, blood plasma is also the most complicated body fluid. For targeted plasma biomarker detection or untargeted plasma biomarker discovery, the challenges can be as difficult as identifying a needle in a haystack. A useful platform must not only pursue single performance characteristics, but also excel at multiple performance parameters, such as speed, accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, cost, portability, reliability, and user friendliness.

The ability of experienced physicians to predict positive throat cultures of S. pyogenes is moderate with estimated sensitivity and specificity ranging from 55 to 74% and 58 to 76%, respectively. In an attempt to improve clinical sensitivity and specificity, investigators have developed clinical decision rules based on constellation of physical signs and symptoms [13, 30, 33] . The Centor score has been the most reliable predictors for estimating the likelihood of infections of S. pyogenes in a patients presenting with a sore throat [9] . The score is calculated by determining how many of the following four clinical features are present: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, anterior cervical adenopathy, and absence of cough. At the usual clinical setting, the majority of primary care physicians prescribe antimicrobial agents and pain-killers based on the severity of illness [18] . Although the Center score is useful to infer S. pyogenes, the score is not valuable for diagnosis of the severity of the illness.

In clinical practice, narrowing of antibiotic therapy is, unfortunately, unusual, but the committee strongly recommends this as best medical practice. The possibility of polymicrobial CAP and the potential benefit of combination therapy for bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia have complicated the decision to narrow antibiotic therapy. Delays in starting antibiotic therapy that result from the need to obtain specimens, complications of invasive diagnostic procedures, and unneeded antibiotic changes and additional testing for false-positive tests are also important considerations. The general recommendation of the committee is to strongly encourage diagnostic testing whenever the result is likely to change individual antibiotic management. For other patients with CAP, the recommendations for diagnostic testing focus on patients in whom the diagnostic yield is thought to be greatest. These 2 priorities often overlap. Recommendations for patients in whom routine diagnostic testing is indicated for the above reasons are listed in Retrospective studies of outpatient CAP management usually show that diagnostic tests to define an etiologic pathogen are infrequently performed, yet most patients do well with empir-ical antibiotic treatment [42, 106] . Exceptions to this general rule may apply to some pathogens important for epidemiologic reasons or management decisions. The availability of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, specific treatment and chemoprevention, and epidemiologic importance make influenza testing the most logical.

Essentially, this has been done through adaptation of conventional analytical methods and instrumentation to portable and automated devices, able to be handled by laboratory unskilled personnel (viz., veterinarian practitioners and farmers). Several nomenclatures have been given to these tests. They include the names ""fi eld tests"", ""rapid tests"", ""biosensors"", and ""point-of-care (POC) tests""; this last term will be predominantly used throughout this chapter. Improved diagnostic tests are necessary for asymptomatic diseases, for diseases with misleading symptoms, for diseases requiring different treatments, or for diseases that, by their complex or costly treatment, require previous case confi rmation. By contrast, these tests will likely have little or no impact for diseases which are easily recognized by their clinical symptoms and for which a syndromic treatment/approach is recommended.

These vary in terms of sensitivity and ease of use; the specific test employed will dictate the swab transport system used. In pediatric patients, if the direct antigen test is negative, and if the direct antigen test is known to have a sensitivity of <80%, a second throat swab should be examined by a more sensitive direct NAAT or by culture as a means of arbitrating possible false-negative direct antigen test results [102] . This secondary testing is not necessarily required in adults [103] . A convenient means of facilitating this 2-step algorithm of testing for Streptococcus pyogenes in pediatric patients is to collect a dual swab initially, recognizing that the second swab will be discarded if the direct antigen test is positive. b Direct and amplified NAATs for Streptococcus pyogenes are more sensitive than direct antigen tests and, as a result, negative direct NAAT results do not have to be arbitrated by a secondary test.

However, the mode of transmission and/or acquisition is not necessarily that of an STI for VVC, but may be for BV and is for TV. A number of pointof-care tests can be performed from a vaginal discharge specimen while the patient is in the healthcare setting. Although point-of-care tests are popular, the sensitivity and specificity for making a specific diagnosis vary widely and these assays, while rapid, are often diagnostically poor. Some of the tests include a pH strip test, scored Gram stain for BV, wet mount for TV, and 10% KOH microscopic examinations for VVC. For BV, use of clinical criteria (Amsel diagnostic criteria) is equal to a scored Gram stain of vaginal discharge. However, a scored Gram stain is more specific than probe hybridization, point-of-care tests, and culture that only detect the presence of G. vaginalis as the hallmark organism for altered vaginal flora) Table 38 . For VVC and TV, the presence of pseudohyphae and motile trichomonads, respectively, allows a diagnosis. However, proficiency in microscopic examination is essential given that infections may be mixed and/or present with atypical manifestations. Unfortunately, consistent microscopic examination of vaginal specimens and interpretation are difficult for many laboratories to perform and wide variation of sensitivities (40%-70%) for both TV and VVC using smear examination exists relative to NAAT and culture, respectively [206] . It should be noted that recent publications utilizing NAATs highlight the prevalence of Trichomonas as equal to or greater than CT and GC in certain patient populations and point to a growing trend toward screening for TV, CT, and GC simultaneously [207, 208] . More recently, microbiome-based multiplex NAATs have become available for the diagnosis of BV and have been validated in several reference laboratories. One commercial product is now FDA-cleared. Preliminary data show greater specificity of this approach compared to methods that identify only G. vaginalis, as well as consistency in both reproducible as well as standardized results.

Ebola virus disease (EVD), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) is transmitted by direct contact with the body fluids of infected person and objects contaminated with virus or infected animals. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared EVD epidemic as public health emergency of international concern with severe global economic burden. At fatal EBOV infection stage, patients usually die before the antibody response. Currently, rapid blood tests to diagnose EBOV infection include the antigen or antibodies capture using ELISA and RNA detection using RT/Q-PCR within 3-10 days after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, few nanotechnology-based colorimetric and paper-based immunoassay methods have been recently reported to detect Ebola virus. Unfortunately, these methods are limited to laboratory only. As state-of-the art (SoA) diagnostics time to confirm Ebola infection, varies from 6 h to about 3 days, it causes delay in therapeutic approaches. Thus developing a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, and selective sensor to detect EVD at point-of-care (POC) is certainly worth exploring to establish rapid diagnostics to decide therapeutics. This review highlights SoA of Ebola diagnostics and also a call to develop rapid, selective and sensitive POC detection of EBOV for global health care.

Herein we have reviewed the performance characteristics of one such test, the FLU OIA test. The FLU OIA test is a unique POC test based on silicon chip biosensor-mediated detection of in£uenza A and B nucleoprotein. The test is broadly reactive with in£uenza A and B viruses and is used in a wide range of health-care organizations worldwide. It has been found to be compatible with a large number of specimen types, including mucoid specimens such as sputum, which can present problems for`dipstick'-type POC tests relying on chromatographic technology or £ow-through membrane-based tests.",27.62923710159468,10.966102631034477

These advantages, and especially the high specificity are important for their use as surveillance tools for influenza outbreaks as recommended by the World Health Organization [8] . Indeed for surveillance purpose a high specificity is of importance, which we found to be the case in our study. However, for clinical management this is not sufficient. In theory, the decision to start antiviral therapy and to refrain from unnecessary further diagnostic testing and antibiotic use may be based on RADT [16] [17] [18] . In addition, rapid test results may result in more effective isolation and containment measures [6] . For this purpose assay sensitivity is of utmost importance. Therefore, we conclude that the relatively low sensitivity of the BNI in our tertiary care centre is worrisome.

There were, however, no cases of meningitis associated with influenza, although admittedly the numbers in our study are not large, and in our view, a systematic review of influenza and serious concomitant infection is indicated to further address this question. Our study is important in finding that the risk of SBI in children with influenza or ORVIs was low during a busy winter season, and yet, children with influenza undergo significantly higher number of invasive diagnostic procedures on presentation that might be reduced by improved ascertainment of influenza directly on admission. There are high rates of immunisation against pneumococcal, Hib and meningococcal C disease in Western Sydney, which explains why bacterial meningitis is now rare. 14 Our study shows that about 17% of the children in the influenza group were younger than 3 months of age, while only 6% in the ORVI group were <3 months (P < 0AE01). However, overall, about half of the children in either group were aged <1 year (Figure 1 ). This is consistent with findings from other studies. [15] [16] [17] Many of the influenza cases in our study were too young to be immunised against influenza. Considering the high burden of influenza in young children and the frequent use of invasive diagnostic procedures, it is important to consider how to rapidly screen febrile children with respiratory symptoms during the influenza season, for example, with a rapid diagnostic test. Indeed, a rapid diagnostic test (QuickVue Influenza A + B; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates evaluated at our hospital during the 2009 pandemic season was found to be both sensitive and specific (84% and 98AE4%, respectively) compared with nucleic acid testing. 18 Studies conducted elsewhere also have shown good sensitivity and specificity, 19 but some rapid diagnostic tests perform better than others and their sensitivities, particularly, may vary according to the swab type, influenza virus strain and patients' age. 20 As children with confirmed influenza were very unlikely to suffer from meningitis, rapid screening for influenza during the influenza season may greatly reduce the need for LP; this may have economic benefits too. A study from Spain has shown that patients positive for influenza, using a rapid diagnostic test in the emergency department, had a significantly reduced rate of hospitalisation compared with those who were negative. 21 A US study found that using influenza status alone, as a screening test for infants with SBI (with a positive influenza test being indicative of low risk for SBI), resulted in a negative predictive value of 97AE5% (95% CI 93AE0-99AE2%). 6 From a clinical perspective, if the admitting consultant paediatrician were to review in person all cases being considered for LP, as occurs, for example, in Finland (T. Heikkinen, personal communication), the proportion undergoing the procedure may well be reduced. Notwithstanding, if meningitis is clinically suspected, the clinician should act accordingly, irrespective of the outcome of influenza diagnostic tests.",36.05010405472475,12.497871572792977

We hypothesized that having a shorter TAT may influence the clinician's decision making to delay empiric antibiotic therapy knowing that assay results would be available within a few hours. A study among patients who tested positive using a rapid influenza test found that when the clinician was aware of the results they were significantly less likely to prescribe antibiotics (7.3% vs. 24.5%) and more likely to give an antiviral [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] prescription (18.8% vs. 6.7%) relative to when the clinician was unaware the patient was positive for influenza. [13] In our study, patients with RP test results available approximately 26 h faster than RVP were less likely to have empiric antibiotic therapy (32.0% vs. 51.1%) as well as a significantly shorter duration of empiric broad-spectrum (6.4 vs. 32.9 h) and narrow-spectrum therapy (9.1 vs. 31.4 h). According to CDC guidelines, anti-influenza therapy is recommended for patients < 2 years with signs and symptoms of flu-like illness. [19] In addition, multiple observational studies have demonstrated that receipt of oseltamivir significantly improves patient outcomes for patients with influenza [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , although clinical improvement is more likely if oseltamivir is initiated shortly after symptom onset [22, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . A prospective study of ICU influenza patients compared early treatment vs. late treatment oseltamivir administration and found that early treatment had shorter ICU LOS (18.4 vs. 22.7 days), shorter hospital LOS (27.2 vs. 34.0 days), and decreased likelihood of mortality (21.5% vs. 34.3%) [24] . In our study, nearly 80% of RP influenza patients received oseltamivir within 48 h of result availability, compared with 19.3% for RVP influenza patients.

Recognition of the need for a relatively affordable test for use in diagnosis in camels which would also be sensitive and specific led to the development of an immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for the rapid and direct qualitative detection of MERS-CoV antigen . The test was based on use of monoclonal antibodies for detection of N protein at room temperature and was 93.9% and 100% sensitive and specific respectively in relation to UpE and ORF1a real-time RT-PCR-based detection in a study on 571 camel nasal swabs . Another N protein antigen-detection test, this time capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on 2 N protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) has also been developed and shown to be 100% specific in testing of a series of 129 nasopharyngeal aspirates known to be positive for various respiratory viruses . Such a sensitive and specific ELISA test would be feasible for MERS-CoV detection both in clinical samples, in particular for point-of-care testing, and in dromedaries and other animals, and may have particular utility in field studies in KSA and elsewhere in the Middle East and in mass gathering contexts such as Hajj (Chan et al., 2017; . The relative affordability and lower resource-intensiveness would give it an advantage over RT-PCR based methods in these types of contexts.

The only recommended rapid test for detection of TB with and without rifampicin resistance is the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). The WHO recommends the Xpert test for those suspected of having drug-resistant TB or in HIV; however, culture is still the mainstay and is not replaced by the Xpert test. TB skin testing (Mantoux testing) uses a purified protein derivative injected under the skin. Its advantages are that it can be used for large-scale screening and it is cost effective. Skin testing does have several disadvantages when used as a diagnostic test. Reading the induration requires training and immunodeficiencies can alter the magnitude of the induration. Immunosuppressed patients (HIV, organ transplant) are considered positive if the induration is ≥5 mm. Some immunodeficiencies may completely ablate the response. Other causes of false-negative tests are malnutrition, concurrent infection, recent live viral vaccine administration, renal failure, malignancy, medical stress, very elderly, young infants, or with a very recent infection with MTB. Conversely, the results may be falsely positive if BCG has been administered.

Additionally, and seldom considered for their value, point-of-care tests for viral infections are especially capable of identifying patients that have not been exposed, allowing the clinician reliably to rule out infection by the organism for which the animal is tested. In addition, many commercial and point-of-care serologic assays are available that detect antibody to many of the viruses affecting dogs and cats. However, the positive predictive value of antibody tests is considerably lower than that for antigen tests. For example, a single ROUTINE PROCEDURES 473 positive antibody titer in a dog for canine distemper is evidence of prior exposure or vaccination. A POSITIVE antibody titer to a particular viral pathogen does not constitute a diagnosis of infection, especially in the absence of clinical signs. However, a NEGATIVE antibody titer generally does denote no prior exposure or failure to respond to vaccination.

Results: A total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P ¼ .007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P < .001), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days, P < .001). Conclusions and Implications: Combining rapid viral surveillance and PCT test is a useful strategy for early detection of potential viral epidemics and antibiotic stewardship.

The diagnosis of HPAIV H5 generally includes conventional virus culture followed by serological differentiation but also may include rapid and more cost-effective technologies that allow for the detection of subtype-specific viral antigens or nucleic acids. For the diagnosis of HPAIV H5 infections in humans, the WHO recommended RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR or other molecular methods, such as rapid antigen detection systems or so-called point-of-care testing and virus culture (WHO, 2007) . Commercially available rapid antigen detection systems can, in principle, be used at the point of care, even by untrained personnel without laboratory equipment, and provide results within 15-30 min. However, point-of-care tests (generally lateral flow tests) vary greatly in their sensitivity and specificity, and laboratory confirmation of reactive samples is required (Beigel et al., 2005; Petric et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2007; Cui and Tong, 2008) . Direct comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of the available point-of-care tests is difficult due to variable conditions for test evaluations. Preliminary results showed a poor clinical sensitivity by commercial rapid antigen detection systems for the diagnosis of avian influenza (AI) in patients. Furthermore, some of the tests detect several subtypes of influenza A viruses and are therefore not H5-specific (Chotpitayasunondh et al., 2005; Chan et al., 2007; Ghebremedhin et al., 2009) .

Such systems are useful in clinical settings where fast assays guide physicians to make the best possible clinical decisions, for example, when a quarantine of infected patients is needed, followed by clinical and therapeutic monitoring. Next to the clinical application, the use of rapid antigen detection tests is desirable for community surveillance, in facility outbreaks and other epidemiological situations, in order to detect epidemiological trends (Rouleau et al., 2009) .The discussion of rapid antigen detection systems mainly involves sensitivity and specificity. A recent evaluation of several test methods for the detection of the novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) confirm that both criteria remain questionable (Ginocchio et al., 2009; Vasoo et al., 2009; Sambol et al., 2010) . The problems of sensitivity and specificity in rapid antigen detection systems remain, whether H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 viruses are present, and therefore, the need for better assays is essential.

Furthermore, when using Poly-HRP40 conjugate instead of HRP-conjugated streptavidin, the detection limit was significantly improved, to 0.004-0.005 HA (0.1 ng/ml).

To develop a rapid diagnostic test, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against influenza virus A subtype H5 was generated. Eleven mAbs were produced and characterised according to their reactivity by indirect and sandwich ELISA and western blotting against different H5 subtypes representing past and viruses currently circulating. Ten out of 11 mAbs reacted strongly with the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of H5 viruses, whereas one mAb reacted with the M1 protein. Targeted HA protein epitopes seemed to be conformational. One hybridoma clone binds to a linear epitope of the M1 protein. One specific mAb reacts with HPAIV H5 in the immunofluorescence test, and two antibodies neutralised H5 viruses.

This project was initiated because there was a growing demand for the improvement of commercially available test kits for diagnostics of H5N1 in human samples. Available rapid antigen detection systems either did not discriminate between influenza A virus subtypes or showed a low sensitivity, leading to such tests having questionable suitability for routine application in the clinical setting (Chan et al., 2007; Rouleau et al., 2009; Ghebremedhin et al., 2009) . Ideally, rapid antigen detection tests would have a high sensitivity for detection of H5N1 virus and would also be able to differentiate between subtypes (Chan et al., 2007) . Compared to polyclonal antibodies, mAbs offer the unique advantages of increased specificity, unlimited availability, and consistent properties that may be exploited for diagnostic applications (Yang et al., 2008; Oh et al., 2009) . The immunisation strategy is one of the most important steps for the generation of antibodies to detect native antigens. Different approaches for the immunisation of mice with influenza viruses were reported: immunisation with Bromelain-purified BHA (Russ et al., 1987) , recombinant antigens (He et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2008) , formaldehyde-treated whole virus (Huang et al., 2007) , or ␥-irradiated immunogen (Oh et al., 2009) . It is known that epitopes of virus fixed in formaldehyde can be altered and therefore can induce mAbs, which do not react with native antigenic determinants (Duque et al., 1989) . Beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated virus was chosen for the immunisation used here on the basis of the following rationale: BPL preserves viruses close to their native structure and interacts preferentially with the viral genome (Wainberg et al., 1971 ) Surface proteins remain intact, which induces the production of mAbs against both linear and conformational epitopes. Mice that were immunised twice with this antigen preparation produced a long-lasting, stable titre.

Subgroup analysis from the trial suggests that these antibiotic changes occurred predominantly in patients with exacerbation of airways disease testing positive for viruses, with little difference seen in antibiotic use in other clinical groups such as patients with community acquired pneumonia or in patients testing negative for viruses. Several observational studies support the findings of ResPOC, demonstrating a reduction in unnecessary antibiotics with rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in a variety of clinical setting. 15, 16 In addition a post hoc analysis from the trial itself suggests that the very rapid turnaround times for results seen with POCT compared to laboratory testing are critical in modifying antibiotic use in hospitalised patients. 17 Several rapid molecular test platforms for respiratory viruses are now available with the potential for deployment as POCTs in clinical areas and their use in hospitals is becoming more widespread. 18 However, there is a lack of evidence to inform clinicians and hospitals in the choice between multiplex syndromic panels such as the FilmArray RP, which test for a comprehensive range of respiratory viruses, and platforms that test for influenza only, or for influenza and RSV. Rapid, accurate influenza detection is clearly a priority for hospitals during periods of intense influenza transmission, to correctly and rapidly administer influenza antivirals and to efficiently utilise infection control facilities.

Different statistical tests are used for each of these four types, depending on the type of data. Area data emphasize analysis on the relationship between the tested area and its neighboring area. Pointed data stress the distance between the two points. However, the central point of an area can be regarded as a point and then be tested in point data. Besides, both LISA and Moran's I spatial autocorrelation tests in Table 10 -1 can be applied to point or polygon data, depending on the definition of the spatial relationship. If public health authorities have pointed data, more hypotheses can be tested and better diffusion dynamics of cases can be described. To protect patients' privacy, more area-type data are available than pointed-type data, particularly for those infectious diseases with higher social stigma. Table 10 -1 summarizes the clustering methods. The first two methods (Whittemore's test and K nearest neighbors) are global tests for pointed data and the next three methods are local tests for pointed data. Whittemore's test is to measure the mean distance of all cases divided by the mean distance of all individuals in that area. IF this ratio is less than 1, it reflects there is a cluster.

Moreover, bacterial defence mechanisms developed in response to host immunoglobulins (e.g. production of antibody degrading proteinases) can impede the success of antibody-based therapy.

The WWTF is a state-of-art-closed circuit type wind tunnel with two test sections named 'high-speed' and 'low-speed' based on operating wind speeds ranges. The 'high-speed' section, which is 29.2 m long with a cross section of 3×2 m 2 , can operate under the maximum wind speed of 25 ms −1 . The 'low-speed' section has larger test section dimensions of 41×5×4 m 3 for length, width and height respectively. Maximum operating wind speed in the low-speed section is about 10 ms −1 . The 'low-speed' section was selected to conduct all wind tunnel tests described in this paper due to its larger test sections dimensions. The larger test section may reduce flow reflections from the side walls of wind tunnel after installing the vane system. Fig. 6 displays the installed vane system 4 m upstream of the centre of the turntable in the ''low-speed' section (TB1). The vane system consists of five individual vanes fixed in a row across the width of the test section with 0.75 m spacing between two adjacent vanes. The 1 m×1 m grid as shown in Fig. 6 (marked with dashed lines) was used to evaluate flow consistency of simulated twisted wind flows because (1) the vanes may affect the wind flow by reducing wind speeds and/or increasing turbulence levels, and (2) flow properties can vary in both the longitudinal and lateral directions in the test section. Another purpose of flow property assessment was to select an area with consistent flow properties to conduct pedestrian-level wind tunnel tests later. In order to assess simulated wind flows, wind profiles were measured at each grid point of the 1 m×1 m grid by using a TFI® Series 100 Cobra probe. The Cobra probe is a dynamic multi-hole pressure probe, which is capable of measuring three components of mean and fluctuating wind speeds including turbulent intensities and static pressure. The frequency response of this instrument is 0-2000 Hz and can measure wind speeds from 2 ms −1 to 100 ms −1 with an accuracy of ± 0.5 ms −1 , which is sufficient for measuring turbulent flows inside a BLWT. Additionally, a Cobra probe can measure yaw and pitch angles of wind flows approaching within angles of ± 45°and have a measurement accuracy of ± 1°. At each grid point, mean wind speed, turbulence intensity, and yaw angle were measured at 12 discrete points in the vertical direction. The discrete points at heights of 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 mm were pre-set by using a 1-dimensional traverse system, which has an accuracy of ± 1 mm at any given height. For the evaluation process, measurements were taken for 130 s at a frequency of 2000 Hz at each height. The measurements in the wind tunnel replicated the wind speeds recorded over an hour in the field condition.",28.877364304454375,10.10707750655903

Diagnosis is even more complicated as the disease progresses, since the clinical symptoms can mimic those of other diseases that are common in the endemic areas (Atouguia and Kennedy, 2000) . Patients normally consult a health professional when the disease is advanced and irreversible brain damage has probably occurred (Robays et al., 2004) . Development of a sensitive and reliable test for HAT is therefore a priority for early treatment and implementation of appropriate control measures. Furthermore, a test that is rapid and can give results at the point of care, would be ideal in the expansive and remote endemic areas of Africa. In the present study, we have demonstrated the use of LAMP technology in diagnosis of HAT using laboratory propagated isolates, as well as clinical samples. The RIME LAMP test that we have developed is rapid, and results are obtained within 35 min using a normal water bath to maintain the temperature at 62°C.

Therefore, rapid diagnostic methods were developed for the detection of viral proteins or RNA in respiratory secretions. RSV antigen tests mostly rely on direct immunofl uorescent assays (DFA) on exfoliated cells in secretions or enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Nucleic acid detection assays based on RT-PCR are now widely available for RSV, often in a multiplexed panel for detection of multiple respiratory virus pathogens. These tests are typically more sensitive than any of the virus isolation or protein-based detection assays discussed above. Enhanced sensitivity is especially helpful when testing adults, who often shed virus in very low titers. Positive RT-PCR tests need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario, since the tests can remain positive for prolonged periods of time after infection, well beyond the period during which infectious virus can be isolated. Since children may experience symptomatic respiratory infections every few weeks during the winter, caution must be used in interpretation of positive PCR tests, especially when multiple viruses are detected simultaneously in a sample. Some instances of multiple PCR test positivity likely represent residual RNA from a previous virus infection and a second RNA type representing live virus from the active current infection.",26.49461057710347,12.69840904896154

However, it was soon discovered that the sensitivity of these rapid tests was very low for novel H1N1, leading to numerous false negatives. 7 Confirmatory testing consists of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or viral culture; this testing is usually obtained via state health department reference laboratories. The focus group participants stated that many patients with negative rapid tests were later found to be positive for novel H1N1 on RT-PCR or viral culture. The focus group participants identified various infection prevention issues resulting from the lack of a reliable rapid test for novel H1N1. One issue identified by the focus group members was the lack of consistency regarding the use of the rapid test for surveillance or treatment purposes. As one participant noted, ''We don't clearly define what we want the testing to provide for us. It's either a surveillance and/or a treatment modality.'' Many focus group participants emphasized that testing only lasted for a short period of time and had very specific rules regarding who could be tested. This caused a lot of confusion among the general public and made surveillance and control measures much more difficult for the focus group members. As one participant explained it, ''That's one of the reasons the decision was made to stop [testing] because we knew [novel H1N1] was out there. So what's the point? We're not going to treat [the infected individuals]. We're not going to do anything unless they're admitted, critically ill, etc.'' Another focus group member relayed her experience with the public's perception about rapid testing:",31.727829229372,12.373429692543334

Nasopharyngeal aspirates and washes followed by nasopharyngeal swabs and mid-turbinate swabs from each nostril provide higher yields than throat swabs. Flocked swabs release samples into transport media better than mattress swabs. Samples obtained within 2-4 days of symptom onset provide higher yields than those in the first 12 h. RT-PCR is more sensitive than culture because it does not require infectious virus, and remains positive longer in transport. Results in experienced laboratories which monitor test performance are better [38] . Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are increasingly used for ILI screening. Sixteen studies 2002-2009 of the QuickVue Rapid Flu test found marked heterogeneity (I 2 = 92.5%). Compared to viral culture or RT-PCR random-effects sensitivity was 72% (62%, 81%) and specificity 96% (93%, 97%) [37] . A study of the patients in six US states found the Quidel QuickVue A + B test had 59% sensitivity and 97% specificity compared to RT-PCR [29] . A meta-analysis of 159 studies (35% during the H1N1 pandemic) of 26 RIDTs found many methodological defects: only 33% defined recruitment criteria, 41% were blinded, and 13% provided information on symptom duration. The RIDT was compared to RT-PCR in 54% of studies, to viral culture in 43% and to both in 3%. RT-PCR is more sensitive than culture, and RIDT pooled sensitivities compared to RT-PCR were lower (53.9%; 48.2%, 59.6%) than compared to viral culture (72.3%; 66.8%, 7.9%). RIDT specificity was high (98.8%; 98.3%, 99.3%) compared to RT-PCR and (96.7%; 95.2%, 98.3%) compared to viral culture. Sensitivity was higher in children (66.6%; 61.6%, 71.7%) than adults (53.9%; 47.9%, 59.8%) because they have higher viral loads and shed longer. Sensitivity was also higher in Influenza A (64.6%; 59.0%, 70.1%) compared to Influenza B (52.2%; 45.0%, 59.3%) [39] . There are few head-tohead comparisons of RIDTs. Directigen Flu A had the highest pooled sensitivity (76.7%; 63.8%, 86%) but it was not statistically better than the next best test (QuickVue Influenza Test), and Directigen Flu A + B (p = 0.011), QuickVue Influenza A + B (p < 0.001) and BinaxNOW (p = 0.028) were statistically inferior to the other RIDTs combined [39] . Seven FDA-approved RIDTs were tested for their ability to detect variant Influenza A viruses, and all detected the seasonal A/Georgia/01/2011 and six of the seven detected H1N1pdm09 A/California/04/2009, but only four detected all A(H3N2)v viruses and at different concentrations [40] .

Principal results: The WHO and CDC definitions of ""influenza-like illness"" are similar. However many studies use other definitions, some not specifying a temperature and requiring specific respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, making many samples non-comparable. Most ILI studies find less than 25% of cases are RT-PCR-positive, those which test for other viruses and bacteria usually find multiple other pathogens, and most identify no pathogen in about 50% of cases. ILI symptom and symptom combinations do not have high sensitivity or specificity in identifying PCR-positive influenza cases. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are increasingly used to screen ILI cases and they have low sensitivity and high specificity when compared to RT-PCR in identifying influenza. Main conclusions: The working diagnosis of ILI presumes influenza may be involved until proven otherwise. Health care workers would benefit by renaming the WHO and CDC ILI symptoms and signs as ""acute respiratory illness"" and also using the WHO acute severe respiratory illness definition if the illness is severe and meets this criterion. This renaming would shift attention to identify the viral and bacterial pathogens in cases and epidemics, identify new pathogens, implement vaccination plans appropriate to the identified pathogens, and estimate workload during the viral season. Randomised controlled trials testing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine require all participants to be assessed by a gold standard (RT-PCR). ILI has no role in measuring influenza vaccine effectiveness. ILI is well established in the literature and in the operational definition of many surveillance databases and its imprecise definition may be inhibiting progress in research and treatment. The current ILI definition could with benefit be renamed ""acute respiratory illness,"" with additional definitions for ""severe acute respiratory illness"" (SARI) with RT-PCR testing for pathogens to facilitate prevention and treatment. also varied over time.

Project Silent Guardian was a 10-week trial launched by the Naval Research Laboratory during the 2005 US Presidential Inauguration [41] . The challenge was to take laboratory-based microarray technology to a production-scale system capable of operationally screening up to 300 samples per day. A custom DNA microarray was designed with the capability of detecting 20 natural (including avian flu) and biothreat agents with strain-level resolution. In total, 10 000 samples were collected and screened by civilian and military laboratory personnel within the stipulated period. The trial included blinded samples that were spiked with pathogens, which were all successfully detected. This exercise showcased the feasibility of implementing microarrays as a screening tool for EOS and demonstrated their use as a rapid and robust means of sample processing and pathogen identification. Recommendations from the study included the development of a more user-friendly system with greater automation of the steps involved. These features are being incorporated by several recently launched commercial platforms. Microarray-based platforms for biothreat screening from Akonni Biosystems (http://www.akonni. com) and Veredus Laboratories (http://www.vereduslabs. com) are now on the market for multiplexed threat detection. New advances include (i) greater integration of the sample preparation (which is considered to be one of the major bottlenecks), (ii) the use of mPCR and (iii) the development of small handheld microfluidic chips and portable readers to take microarray technology to the point-ofcare. Veredus has also recently launched an influenza test chip that enables the amplification and discrimination of influenza A and B subtypes, including avian flu (H5N1), within just two hours. This great improvement in detection time has been attributed to the mPCR step, which, through rapid thermocycling, significantly reduces the duration of PCR to under 30 min. Similar devices might be developed in the future for protein and other types of non-DNA microarrays for applications in serodiagnostics.",26.29657686471071,11.181393169876873

One adult study found that 9.5% of febrile patients had malaria parasitemia, but there was no significant difference compared with the afebrile control group (8%) [2] . A prospective study conducted in rural Cambodia enrolled patients with acute febrile illness and a parallel group of nonfebrile accompanying people as controls. Although malaria, most Leptospira spp., influenza, and dengue were identified more frequently among the febrile patients, the detection of these same pathogens in the afebrile control group at a nontrivial rate was striking [87] . It is surprising that Leptospira interrogans was detected by PCR at a significantly higher frequency in the afebrile controls than in the febrile patients (8.5% vs 5.1%, respectively; P = .04) [87] , which highlights the caution required when interpreting positive results. Point-of-Care Tests. Rapid point-of-care tests are becoming more widely available. For patients who presented with febrile illness to an Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were useful in confirming a wide range of diagnoses other than Ebola virus disease and reducing patient lengths of stay [88] . Although they may represent some improvement over older serologic assays, they may still lack sensitivity and specificity as a result of the cross-reactivity of the selected antigens, and they can also be limited by the lack of a reference standard. These limitations were seen in the case of 2 RDTs for S enterica serovar Typhi, for which the sensitivity ranged from 56% to 84% and the specificity ranged from 72% to 95% [89] . However, although malaria RDTs have sensitivities of up to 95% [90] and are consequently useful for targeting treatment in resource-limited settings [91, 92] , clinic-based diagnoses of malaria RDT-negative cases are poorly predictive for the pathogen, have not yet improved health outcomes for patients compared to clinical diagnosis, and do not provide guidance for appropriate management [87, 93] .",29.024902055439423,10.59536907118755

The clinical impression of the treating physician has been shown to be fairly inaccurate at making this differentiation [69] [70] [71] . A clinical prediction rule for presence of strep throat that has some utility uses the presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate. No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat [72] . Another dilemma in identifying group A strep in patients with pharyngitis is the sensitivity of rapid group A antibody kits compared to a throat culture. Many studies have shown that a rapid test is less sensitive than the culture for identifying the presence of group A strep. The rapid tests have a high degree of specificity, but their sensitivity in clinical practice can be unacceptably low. Sensitivities for the rapid test compared to a standard blood agar culture vary considerably but are generally in the range of 60-70%. Studies also have demonstrated that in circumstances when the colony counts are low, rapid tests are more likely to miss the presence of group A streptococcus. However, when the seroconversion of ASO titers is used as the gold standard for infection, rapid tests perform very well [69] . It is likely that rapid tests miss patients who have a small number of organisms and who are likely to be colonized instead of infected. Thus, rapid testing may be more specific in identifying patients with actual strep-related disease than cultures, which also identify those who are likely to be carriers. This comparison suggests that follow-up throat cultures are not necessary and may actually confuse treatment decisions. Rapid strep testing without culture also has been shown to be the most cost-effective approach to managing acute pharyngitis [73] .",28.03694557886813,10.134662126596004

Ebola virus disease (EVD), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) is transmitted by direct contact with the body fluids of infected person and objects contaminated with virus or infected animals. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared EVD epidemic as public health emergency of international concern with severe global economic burden. At fatal EBOV infection stage, patients usually die before the antibody response. Currently, rapid blood tests to diagnose EBOV infection include the antigen or antibodies capture using ELISA and RNA detection using RT/Q-PCR within 3-10 days after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, few nanotechnology-based colorimetric and paper-based immunoassay methods have been recently reported to detect Ebola virus. Unfortunately, these methods are limited to laboratory only. As state-of-the art (SoA) diagnostics time to confirm Ebola infection, varies from 6 hours to about 3 days, it causes delay in therapeutic approaches. Thus developing a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, and selective sensor to detect EVD at point-of-care (POC) is certainly worth exploring to establish rapid diagnostics to decide therapeutics. This review highlights SoA of Ebola diagnostics and also a call to develop rapid, selective and sensitive POC detection of EBOV for global health care. We propose that adopting miniaturized electrochemical EBOV immunosensing can detect virus level at pM concentration within ~40 minute compared to 3 days of ELISA test at nM levels.",27.33689113581742,9.292714731331644

Rapid virus detection culture such as shell vial or cluster trays facilitate detection of adenovirus, influenza A and B virus, PIV 1-4, hMPV, and RSV within 48 h [25] . Assays for virus antigen detection involve the use of viral antigen-specific antibodies using direct fluorescence antibody test and rapid antigen test. The direct fluorescence antibody test can detect AdeV, influenza A and B virus, hMPV, PIV, and RSV within 30 to 60 min [26] , while the rapid direct antigen test utilizes immuno-chromatographic antibody detection kits that are simple to perform (detection in 15-20 min), but so far limited only for detecting influenza A and B virus and RSV [27, 28] . Lastly, molecular detection includes amplification of viral nucleic acid sequences through polymerase chain reaction of patient samples.

This finding suggested that the ELISA OD and the IF titers were only moderately associated; the difference between the two approaches could be due to the fact that the new test utilized recombinant proteins rather than the virus-infected cells used in the IF test. However, it is noteworthy that the overall performances of both the ELISA and the rapid test were well in concordance with the IF titers. Both new tests detected progressively more patient samples as IF titers increased (Fig. 2) . This finding, thus, suggested that the shortcomings of the new tests were mostly limited to samples with IF titers lower than 1:40 (Fig. 2) . Nevertheless, the two new tests had similar overall sensitivities of 70.5 to 71.8% and specificities of 97.7 to 99.5% relative to the IF test, which was used as the gold standard (Tables 1 and 2) .

Nasopharyngeal swabs or washings may be used for viral isolation. In general, higher concentrations of virus are found in nasal secretions than in oropharyngeal secretions. During influenza A epidemics, oropharyngeal secretions contain higher concentrations of influenza virions than nasal secretions. In alveolar macrophages, influenza A viruses produce cytopathogenic effects (CPEs), but are nonspecific and difficult to detect. CPEs due to influenza A are apparent in approximately 50% of cultures within 3 days of inoculation and in approximately 90% within 5 days. Identification of cells showing CPE may be verified using immunofluorescent technique or type/subtype specific antisera. The most common rapid method of influenza laboratory diagnosis is by FA techniques. For FA testing for respiratory viruses, nasopharyngeal aspirates are preferred to swabs. FA influenza assays identify viral antigens in infected respiratory epithelial cells. [22] [23] [24] [25] During the ''herald wave'' of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic in New York, it was realized that there were problems with screening tests, that is, RIDTs. It was hoped that rapid screening tests for influenza A would detect swine influenza (H1N1), an influenza A virus. Rapid influenza A test positivity was usually predictive of RT-PCR positivity for swine influenza (H1N1). It was quickly realized that negative rapid influenza A testing did not rule out swine influenza (H1N1). False negative rapid influenza A testing for swine influenza (H1N1) was 30%. Respiratory FA viral testing detects influenza A, influenza B, metapneumoviruses, RSVs, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses. Unfortunately, respiratory FA viral testing did not correlate with either rapid influenza A testing or RT-PCR testing. Although the definitive test for swine influenza (H1N1) diagnosis remains RT-PCR, during the pandemic, RT-PCR testing was restricted. Restricted RT-PCR testing resulted in tremendous difficulties in making/ruling out the diagnosis of swine influenza (H1N1) and in initiating/discontinuing influenza precautions. [53] [54] [55] 59 Because of restricted swine influenza (H1N1) RT-PCR testing, clinical criteria were developed for patients presenting with ILIs who had a negative rapid influenza A test. By combining key clinical and nonspecific laboratory features, a clinical diagnosis of probable swine influenza was developed at Winthrop-University Hospital by the Infectious Disease Division. This permitted an operational clinical approach to placing admitted adult patients on influenza precautions/treatment, and was also useful in differentiating swine influenza (H1N1) from its mimics. 54 (see Box 1, Figs. 1-4 , Tables 3-5) .",46.8173084417032,15.741561410145597

In addition, proper validation and standardization of such tests are still required, without which regulatory approvals for testing and commercialization are hardly obtainable. Nevertheless, the suitability of rapid diagnostic tests demonstrated by the validation processes must be complemented with additional figures of merit for implementation in routine diagnosis. Dengue virus is difficult to cultivate and propagate in laboratory, probably due to its wide geographic serotypic and genotypic variability, which has been a major obstacle towards the development and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests for dengue infections. There is still a long way to run from in-the-bench schemes and prototypes to fully developed, commercially attractive biosensing devices, whose wider utilization is still shadowed by well-established and well-performing laboratory assays. Unfortunately, the experimental prerogative for using well-defined, pure synthetic samples has often hindered detailed studies and conclusions about the effect of potentially interfering substances. Cold-chain has supported massive and adequate delivery of rapid diagnostic tests to clinical settings and end-users in remote tropical regions, but is handicapped by frequent irregular power supply in such regions and by the huge costs associated to transportation. Despite all these challenges, rapid diagnostic tests must be considered valuable alternatives rather than competitors to laboratory-based analytical devices and methodologies, even if some loss of sensitivity or selectivity must be accepted in the point-of-care testing. In fact, rapid screening of large amounts of samples may speed up proper decision making by the clinician, while conventional lab-based bioanalytical techniques can be used afterwards for confirmation and better characterization of the infecting pathogen. Reusable diagnostic tests must be avoided when dealing with infectious pathogens, thus explaining the growing interest in the development of chip-based disposable tests. It has been consensual that an efficient rapid diagnostic test for dengue disease should be a multiplexed device for detection and identification of all four dengue serotypes. Future developments and advances in fundamental and engineering sciences will certainly enrich the whole pool of knowledge about rapid diagnostic tests and will also improve micro-and nanofabrication processes for their mass production at an increasing cost-effective basis as well.",42.03907504286519,17.6570937664524

This novel immunochromatographic technique essentially relies on two intersecting strips instead of a single migration strip: one for the sample and the other for a conjugated marker. Since this scheme provides more effective binding of the analyte to the binding site in the test zone prior to attachment of the conjugated marker, overall sensitivity can be enhanced 10-50 times compared to that of common lateral flow tests, while maintaining the specificity [71] . Moreover, the known lengthiness for biological fluid migration in single-path lateral flow tests may thus be obviated, especially in the case of aggregation/agglutination of larger, supramolecular analytes (e.g., whole cells). Results can be obtained in faster time periods with minimal volumes of different body fluids. Such rapidity comes from the possibility of new adding of buffer solution immediately after color vanishing at the test site, rather than waiting for a pre-determined (and often low accurate) time interval. In addition, this cassette platform contains five test lines, thus allowing multiplexed testing of up to five targets in the same reaction (conventional lateral-flow tests, by possessing only one strip, are not usually able to measure beyond a single analyte). For this, different colored latex particles can conjugate with different antigens or antibodies provided in the conjugated pad or in the buffer solution, thus facilitating reading of results [70, 71] . Therefore, the DPP ® may be considered an improved user-friendly test for point-of-care diagnosis, also holding great promise for rapid and multiplexed detection and identification of dengue virus serotypes. Another interesting and promising innovation in the field of immunochromatographic tests is the issue of patterned paper-based substrates as alternative platforms to conventional test strips and to lab-on-a-chip platforms [72] . Paper is a familiar, abundant, cheap, easy-to-use, stable and disposable (easily and safely recyclable by incineration) material; moreover, many standardized printing techniques (e.g., photolithography and inkjet printing) are already available for its functionalization with polymers, biological species and other elements. Mass production of such devices showed to be feasible by coating paper, through inkjet printing, with inks of biomoleculeattached microgel, a suitable material to link biomolecules to paper substrates, thus preserving biomolecule activity after printing [73] . Being usually white, paper is a suitable material for implementing colorimetric tests (namely with enzymes or small-molecule dyes), by providing high contrast with colored substrates. Since color intensity in the detection region is usually a function of the analyte concentration, quantitative measurements are enabled. Other detection methods, however, are also feasible, like electrochemiluminescence and radiolabeling [74] . An enormous advantage of paper-like substrates over solid-support lab-on-a-chip devices and classical porous immunochromatographic substrates is, owing to the fibrous nature of paper, its intrinsic ability for pumping liquid biological samples along imprinted channels by simple capillarity, thus avoiding the need for external pumps and pressure sources [75] . In addition, expensive infrastructures, like clean rooms, are not required for fabrication of sophisticated microdevices through advanced printing techniques [76] . Most of the works with paperbased devices have pointed towards multi-analyte (multiplexed) detection, as a convenient extension of the conventional lateralflow test abilities, by linking a single patterned inlet with various detection regions [77] . However, some recent works have proposed the opposite approach, i.e., multi-analyte detection by converging multiple inlets into a single outlet and detection region, through controlled transport of liquid samples, by suitable tailoring of the network geometry and fluid flow rate, which is required for autonomous driving of multi-step sequences [78, 79] , as seen in Fig. 4 . In this way, more complex processes such as chemical amplification, which requires multiple and sequential reagent delivery and washing steps, can now be extended from the high-performing laboratory bioassays to simple point-of-care devices, as a way to enhance the sensitivity of detection, while maintaining easinessto-use and pricing comparable to those of conventional lateral-flow tests. Hence, these improved paper networks may circumvent the usual lack of sensitivity faced by many current lateral-flow tests unless more complicated and expensive reagents (e.g., particle nanolabels) or instrumentation (e.g., light sources or detectors) are used [79] . In addition, such complex multi-tasking processes require no more than a single-user activation step, a significant advantage when compared to current lateral-flow tests and even with the Chembio DPP ® , which requires an additional user washing step after label binding in the detection region [72] . Ongoing advances in theoretical studies for optimization of engineering design and fluid flow in two-dimensional paper devices [80] will certainly increase the powerfulness and usefulness of these tests for point-of-care diagnosis in resource-limited regions and settings. Alternatively, the performance and flexibility of paper-based analytical devices can also be enhanced by passing from two-to three-dimensional structures. In fact, it is likely that the complexity of three-dimensional paper-based structures may be higher than that of devices based on conventional plastic frames. As an example, the common steps of cell separation and removal and further sample processing may be significantly improved along with liquid wicking throughout the inner layers of the device, until final detection [75] . Despite all these advantages, some concerns must be raised regarding the future of paper-based kits, namely: (a) the ferocious competition of conventional laboratory and lab-on-a-chip analytical devices in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, quantitative outputs and multiplexed ability; (b) the device stability (shelf-life), especially under long-distance transportation and long-time storage at room temperatures; (c) the complexity and current lack of knowledge about fluid flow and biomolecule immobilization and biorecognition onto paper matrices [81] ; (d) research dispersion efforts towards the exploitation and application of novel nanostructures and nanoscaled effects in point-of-care tests [82, 83] . Nevertheless, it is expected that these devices may constitute an example of the desirable combination between the simplicity and the inexpensiveness of common diagnostic test strips and the analytical abilities of microfluidic analytical devices.",29.824595504911574,13.761518449454645
Rapid tests are usually seen as simple and inexpensive devices for qualitative or even quantitative biodetection,0.36232600133142767,1.16201913356781,2.106661319732666,f661e10d-bbfe-42ee-8276-c01041a6fdc7,custom_license/Biosensors and rapid diagnostic tests on the frontier between analytical and clinical chemistry for biomolecular diagnosis of dengue disease: A review,"Fundamental scientists and engineers involved in research and development of biodiagnostic devices and techniques usually employ the term biosensor to describe them, while the medical community and people in general know them preferentially as rapid [diagnostic] tests. Rapid tests are usually seen as simple and inexpensive devices for qualitative or even quantitative biodetection, and able to be used not only by non-specifically skilled healthcare professionals within clinical settings, but also by the end-users (patients) themselves, in domestic and in-thefield contexts. The term biosensor is usually applied to prototypes of new bioanalytical devices, frequently at and in-the-bench development stage (proof-of-concept demonstration) only. The concept has also been used to describe new biosensing techniques and methodologies, even though no commitment exists towards further development of a fully automated and (desirably) portable diagnostic device. As such, as any bulky analytical technique for laboratory analysis, biosensors have been commonly tailored to be highly sensitive, specific, fast and response-proportional [29] (this last requirement, however, is losing importance as ongoing advances in signal processing technology proceed). Although very common in the literature, specific characterization of biosensors based on high sensitivity and selectivity is a questionable issue since, in general, all analytical techniques and devices ultimately envisage this goal. Only few biosensor schemes (research level) proceed towards prototype and device production (development level) and, not surprisingly, the concept of biosensor has been restricted mainly to the laboratory, hence belonging to a scientifically limited domain. Many obstacles arise when attempting to go further, i.e., to mass-production and commercialization. In fact, the still limited availability of commercialized biosensors may be due mainly to a lack in the appropriate technology for cost-effective manufacture than a lack of fundamental (scientific) knowledge [3] . Moreover, the 'real world' of biosensor markets fort Health, especially for in-the-field diagnosis in developing countries, poses hard challenges, especially the demand for high-throughput testing and related mass-production. Thus, the common high-performing standard paradigm of conventional laboratory-based analytical devices, usually relying in high sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility, tends to shift, in the point-of-care, towards the pursuit for simpler, cheaper and faster diagnostic tests. These favorable and desirable characteristics of rapid diagnostic tests for field applicability are frequently achieved at the expense of decreased analytical accuracy (although maintaining reliability, at least at a certain level). Ideally, these tests must be produced in the form of portable (miniaturized), automated (self-powered) readout devices coupled to disposable peripherals (e.g., test strips) where the biorecognition event occurs. Disposability is necessary to avoid contamination when dealing with infectious agents, which guarantees the commercial viability of cheap microfabricated devices for clinical diagnosis [30] . However, the importance of prior purification and chemical modification steps has been relatively underestimated in the development of such simple and inexpensive tests, which is especially relevant in the case of complex biological samples. In the case of DNA detection in clinical samples, there is still the problem of the usual very low levels of DNA. Human genomic DNA levels in blood, for instance, may be 10 14 fold that of a pathogen DNA from a typical blood infection, which may significantly hamper achieving good selectivity levels [31] . Suitable inclusion of these sample preparation steps has thus been undertaken in disposable chip-based and microfluidic (lab-on-a-chip) device formats (see following section for more details). Obviously, these devices do not entirely comply with the exquisite requirements of ideal rapid diagnostic tests, constituting rather a somewhat mid-term between these and heavy laboratory analytical devices. It is expected, however, that simultaneous compliance with point-of-care requirements and analytical reliability may define a desired balance towards the production of improved devices for successful in-the-field applicability. In short, the distinction between biosensors and rapid diagnostic tests is not always straightforward. In this paper, some care was taken to assign the concepts of biosensors and rapid tests to, respectively, in-thebench and fully developed analytical devices. However, usually it is not easy to assess the exact developmental stage of these devices, the reason why establishing such a distinction was not a major concern ahead.",32.73112026264247,13.580534386570175
three lateral flow tests reached higher classifications than the Hapalyse M or the EIA tests concerning ease-to-use,0.162322586788474,0.342437744140625,0.08530988544225693,ec512c1c-c6e7-4fa7-b28d-ab9135ec5604,custom_license/Biosensors and rapid diagnostic tests on the frontier between analytical and clinical chemistry for biomolecular diagnosis of dengue disease: A review,"The performance of diagnostic tests strongly depends on local conditions in which they will be used, namely differences in the characteristics of the population or the infectious agent (e.g., infection prevalence, genetic variation of the pathogen or host) and peculiarities of the test (e.g., methodology and local diagnostic practices) [67] . Therefore, the evaluation of diagnostic tests should ideally be carried out in such particular conditions, including multi-centre trials. Obviously, such test conditions will eventually determine the particular in-the-field situations in which the tests will be used. As an example, strong cross-reactivity may be acceptable if there is low prevalence of the disease in such place or setting [27] . The usual lack of proper validation and standardization of many rapid diagnostic tests for both in-the-field and laboratory usage is partially due to the fact that most laboratories use in-house rather than well-standardized assays and techniques, which strongly discourages compared analysis in aggregate. It is thus important that national or reference healthcare entities establish quality assurance programs that guarantee the production of reference materials and protocols for effective quality control of rapid diagnostic tests [34] . In this regard, the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) (sponsored by UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank and WHO) and the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI) have underpinned an extensive collaborative program aimed to evaluate the performance of commercially available diagnostic tests for dengue, especially IgM-based EIA assays and rapid diag- Table 1 Reported LODs and assay times for dengue biosensors referenced in the literature (discriminated according to the transduction mechanism and probed analyte). nostic tests [27] , mainly on the basis of comparison among them. A specific goal was the assessment of the different patterns of immunoglobulin antibody responses, especially when envisaging accurate diagnosis of acute dengue infections. To accomplish this task, the tests were assayed against a panel of well-characterized serum specimens from persons with confirmed dengue infections and from others with confounding infections and conditions. The inclusion criteria were positive identification of all four dengue serotypes, correct identification of primary/secondary infections and discrimination from other flavivirus and dengue-like diseases, high specificity towards systemic disorders and good performance for various geographical conditions. The evaluation comprised four EIA tests and the rapid tests DuoCassette (Panbio Diagnostics), SD Bioline (Standard Diagnostics) and Dengucheck (Zephyr Biomedicals, India), which are all immunochromatographic tests, and the HapalyseM (Pentax Corporation, Japan), a particle agglutinationbased test. Three of the EIA kits showed good agreement with reference standards, although, in general, have rendered falsepositive results for dengue IgG-positive, rheumatoid factor-positive and dengue IgM-negative/malaria-positive serum samples. In this last case, test usage in settings or regions where both dengue and malaria are endemic must be discarded. The HapalyseM test exhibited sensitivity comparable to the high-performing EIA tests, although the specificity was somewhat inferior to those of the remaining rapid tests. The Dengucheck test exhibited, by far, the lowest sensitivity. The specificity of the lateral flow-based rapid tests was similar to that of EIA tests. Among the tested rapid tests, the three lateral flow tests reached higher classifications than the Hapalyse M or the EIA tests concerning ease-to-use. Even so, to all the four rapid tests, difficult result interpretation (basically due to weak bands in the strip) was claimed ( Table 2) . As a whole, it can be stated that the performances (in terms of sensitivity and specificity) of the rapid tests did not agree with those of reference standard assays as much as those of EIA tests. One major limitation of these evaluation studies is the presumable underestimation of test specificity; in real situations, it is unlikely that all potential causes of false-positive results would be present simultaneously. Moreover, since the four dengue serotypes were not represented in equal proportions in the sample panel (in particular, the small number of DENV4 samples reflected its rarity in most regions), the evaluation of some kits towards primary infections caused by all four serotypes could not be completely assessed. Since most rapid diagnostic tests are targeted to be used by the patients themselves (who, obviously, lack the expertise to properly evaluate and assess the performance of such tests), the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) initiative developed a sequenced checklist to guide adequate report of the results from evaluation studies on diagnostics [68] . Similarly, and recognizing the enormous potential threat of dengue disease introduction in Europe, the European Union started, in 2006, the DENFRAME project, aiming to improve the management of dengue disease among human populations, especially in Asia and Latin-America [69] . One of its working programs involves the development, standardization and automation of novel rapid diagnostic test kits for dengue diagnosis. A complete validation program must include a multi-centre evaluation, which ensures accuracy and robustness of the test, as well as reproducibility of the results within and among different assays and lots. Taking into account the seriousness of clinical applications and implications of rapid diagnostic tests, a full evaluation program of these tests must include, apart performance evaluation (validation), the additional steps of quality control and quality assurance [11] . Quality control guarantees correct functioning of the devices with prolonged use, but traditional procedures normally employed for traditional laboratory devices are not feasible for disposable rapid tests. In such cases, randomly selected units from any production batch of a lot must be assayed and compared to infer reproducibility. A final quality assurance program, on the other hand, demonstrates the readiness of the tests to be introduced in routine clinical diagnosis. Institutional evaluation programs, like those mentioned and described above, are thus meritorious attempts for finally establishing some order and comparison criteria among the vast portfolio of rapid diagnostic tests already available -although still lacking standardization -for dengue and other infectious diseases.",36.29712707858846,12.982030436734833

EIA, often referred to as rapid antigen tests in the clinical setting, have had great success in the diagnosis of influenza and RSV infection in children [30, 38] . Unfortunately, similar results have not been noted in older adults, likely because most rapid antigen tests require ∼10 3 plaque-forming units of virus to generate a positive test result.

Most POC assays have obtained a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waiver, which substantially decreases the regulatory requirements associated with performing the test in a non-lab setting, for instance, in an emergency department or a physician's office. The Alere i was FDA approved in June 2014 and was granted CLIA waiver in January 2015. Although this assay is CLIA waived, it is substantially more complex than any other waived test currently on the market (e.g. rapid antigen tests, beta-HCG tests). The system comprises an instrument that performs one test at a time and a kit, which contains a sample receiver, a test base, and a transfer cartridge. The instrument has a screen that directs the user to follow steps of the procedure. The sample receiver and test base are inserted into the Alere i instrument and the user waits 3 minutes. Then the sample (nasopharyngeal swab) is inserted into the sample receiver, which contains an elution buffer.

When the same set of clinical specimens was tested by the rapid immunochromatographic test, a performance similar to that of the ELISA was obtained. The overall rate of detection of SARS-associated specimens by the rapid test was 70.5% (160 of 227), and its specificity was 97.7% (376 of 385) ( Table  2) . Detection rates were 55, 68, 81, and 79%, respectively, for the four groups of samples collected from SARS patients at 1 to 10 days, 11 to 20 days, 21 to 30 days, and more than 30 days after the onset of clinical symptoms ( Table 2 ). Because this test utilized two recombinant proteins separately, represented by two resultant bands, the performances of the two proteins were also analyzed. The Gst-N protein alone detected antibodies to SARS-CoV in 157 of the 160 samples found to be positive by the two proteins combined (Table 2) . Furthermore, the Gst-N protein presented less cross-reactivity, reacting to only 1 of the 385 specimens from the healthy-control group. In contrast, Gst-U274 detected only 8% (18 of 227) overall of the SARSassociated samples but contributed to most of the nonspecific reactivity with samples from healthy controls (8 of 385). Interestingly, the three samples that were detected by Gst-U274 only, but not by the Gst-N protein, were those collected from patients at an earlier stage, 1 to 20 days after the onset of clinical symptoms ( Table 2 ). The test was therefore shown to have a PPV and an NPV of 94.7 and 84.9%, respectively, with the populations tested (Table 2) .

This finding suggested that the ELISA OD and the IF titers were only moderately associated; the difference between the two approaches could be due to the fact that the new test utilized recombinant proteins rather than the virus-infected cells used in the IF test. However, it is noteworthy that the overall performances of both the ELISA and the rapid test were well in concordance with the IF titers. Both new tests detected progressively more patient samples as IF titers increased (Fig. 2) . This finding, thus, suggested that the shortcomings of the new tests were mostly limited to samples with IF titers lower than 1:40 (Fig. 2) . Nevertheless, the two new tests had similar overall sensitivities of 70.5 to 71.8% and specificities of 97.7 to 99.5% relative to the IF test, which was used as the gold standard (Tables 1 and 2) .

RDTs are generally not as specific and sensitive for the detection of non-falciparum infections, although newer generation RDTs perform well in diagnosing vivax infection. 13, 14 RDTs may be used in addition to, but not as a replacement for blood films and all patients with suspected malaria should have blood films prepared and examined as recommended in the British Committee for Standards in Haematology guidelines. 15 If falciparum or knowlesi malaria is diagnosed, the percentage of red blood cells that are parasitized should be estimated.",25.8190307256824,10.625662735902882

For beef cattle, screening of herds can be achieved by collecting blood at abattoirs and submitting it to the RBT or tube agglutination test. Reactors are traced back to the herd of origin, and the herd is tested. In heavily infected herds, it is best to remove all cows positive to the RBT even though it is highly sensitive and there will be a small percentage of false-positive cows. In herds where the prevalence of infection is low and where vaccination has been used, this procedure will eliminate too many false-positive cows.

Current border screening measures are insufficiently sensitive. The study objectives were to describe the epidemiologic pattern of influenza infection among incoming travellers at Xiamen International Airport during nonpandemic periods and to assess the performance of a rapid influenza diagnostic test in border screening. Methods: Between May 2015 and May 2016, travellers with influenza-like illnesses entering China at Xiamen International Airport were screened with a rapid test, Flu Dot-ELISA, and the collected specimens were further subjected to virus isolation and phylogenetic analysis. Results: Of the 1 540 076 incoming travellers, 1224 cases of influenza-like illness were identified; 261 tested positive in the rapid test, and 176 were confirmed to be influenza through virus culture. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test were demonstrated to be 96.6% (170/176) and 91.3% (957/ 1048), respectively, and the positive predictive and negative predictive values were 65.1% (170/261) and 99.4% (957/963), respectively. The epidemiologic study indicated that H3N2 and (H1N1)pdm09 were dominant in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In 2016, an increased number of influenza B isolates and cocirculation of both Victoria and Yamagata lineage influenza B viruses were observed, and mismatches between circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B Victoria lineage strains and vaccine strains also occurred.

It should be kept in mind that falsenegative rapid antigen results can be expected, and should not be interpreted as excluding the possibility of infection caused by the tested viral pathogen. With low sensitivities, rapid antigen tests were usually relegated to point-of-care testing for influenza in defined settings.

Guidance often is offered in the selection of preferred tests when multiple tests could possibly be used. Issues related to the frequency of testing often are discussed also in terms of what is feasible for the clinical laboratory to perform, and also based on the likely rate of change of any given laboratory test. The development of a new test, such as a technique to detect a specific analyte or infectious agent, is determined by the feasibility of having an outside laboratory perform the test versus the technical expertise and resources available within DLM. An advantage of new test development initially focused on a research question is the potential for the future integration of this test into the menu offered for routine patient care. The chief of DLM and/or relevant senior staff members also review all newly approved protocols.

Cryptococcal antigenemia, particularly at high titers, has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for future CM and a prognostic factor increasing the risk of death in certain populations [29] . Meya et al [16] demonstrated that asymptomatic antigenemic patients who are given fluconazole have improved survival over asymptomatic antigenemic patients who are not given fluconazole. For CrAg1 patients without overt signs and symptoms of cryptococcal infection, a window of opportunity for treatment might have existed to administer amphotericin B or high-dose fluconazole to reduce their risk of developing CM [7, 16, 22, 29231] .

During the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009–2010, existing networks of subject matter experts and expert laboratories, established for the purposes of seasonal influenza surveillance, were able to quickly respond to the outbreak, enabling early detection of the emergent strain,32 rapid implementation of containment measures and adaptation of existing surveillance programme to monitor spread. Diagnostic expertise was particularly important in this case, as the pandemic strain had to be detected against a background of other circulating influenza A strains and other respiratory viruses causing influenza-like illness.32 The influenza example demonstrates the positive impact that collaboration between global and national stakeholders and industry can have on the speed and effectiveness of response. Similar networks of diagnostic experts and laboratories for other relevant pathogens that can be activated in the event of an outbreak would greatly improve research and development times. Both academic and private sector stakeholders would be included with a focus on maximising knowledge sharing and accelerating innovation, in an environment that encourages collaboration rather than competition between developers. Partnering with vaccine developers to find novel diagnostic targets is also strongly recommended, as vaccine developers must conduct extensive research into the immune response to pathogens. An example of how effective this could be is provided by the rk39 ELISA test for detection of visceral leishmaniasis, which was developed by the Infectious Disease Research Institute in Seattle as a by-product of their vaccine research.33

However, these problems were mainly attributed to staff availability to run the test after consenting subjects. The FilmArray itself was reported by them to run in 65 minutes in the POC setting. If the FilmArray could be implemented into the ED as a POC test in a way that would fit seamlessly into ED workflow, the TAT may have been minimized for this assay, and we may have seen more promising results.

This field of molecular microbiology presents many challenges to the practice of laboratory medicine, above all the implementation like automated methodology. The introduction of fully automated devices with faster turnaround times has allowed clinical laboratories the necessary tools to report sensitive and accurate results to physicians. The goals in performing microbiology nucleic acid tests (NAT) are mainly to provide timely results useful for high-quality patient care at a reasonable cost. Rapid results obtained by NAT are associated with improvements in patient care. Empiric data and modeling studies find that faster detection of enteroviral meningitis using NAT is associated with reduced length of stay and duration of antibiotic administration, as well as substantial cost savings [2]. The use of amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [3] for virus detection, genotyping and quantification have some advantages like high sensitivity and reproducibility, as well as a broad dynamic range [4, 5]. A great number of qualitative and quantitative molecular virus assays, mostly based on PCR technology have been described [6, 7]. NASBA assays could identify active infection by detecting viral messenger RNA (mRNA) but the most widely used tests in clinical virus diagnosis are quantitative real-time PCR techniques [8]. Many molecular diagnostic methods have been replaced by automated devices that use less time, manipulate smaller volumes of liquids and provide quantified results with better precision. Molecular techniques have revolutionated the diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly the diagnosis of viral diseases. Automation of these methods provides decrease in turnaround times, low contamination risk, ease of performance and speed, as well as the ability to have lower detection limits and to diminish cost per test.

Thus, the test was primarily used to diagnose influenza in adult patients, especially those with pneumonia. For clinicians who experienced the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, the use of multiplex RT-PCR as a diagnostic test for influenza infection is understandable. At other hospitals, the perception of multiplex RT-PCR testing by physicians may be similar, given the predominance of influenza among RVs and the presence of effective anti-influenza therapies [9]. Therefore, the multiplex RT-PCR test should be performed to diagnose influenza during the flu season, especially considering the low sensitivity of rapid influenza antigen detection tests [9]. However, in our hospital, the multiplex RT-PCR test was performed infrequently compared to rapid influenza antigen detection tests. Additionally, the test was rarely performed in outpatient departments at the study hospital. These findings are understandable given that the test results are not available on-site, unlike the rapid influenza antigen detection test. Moreover, the test is not covered by National Health Insurance of South Korea and is relatively expensive (more than 100,000 KRW) compared to the cost of a respiratory bacterial culture (21,619 KRW) or the rapid influenza antigen detection test (18,000 to 28,000 KRW). Consequently, infrequent ordering resulted in less routine PCR testing in the clinical laboratory (not every day, but three times a week at our hospital). This may explain why a turnaround time of < 48 hours was observed in only 25.9% of the positive tests. Forty-eight hours is the most appropriate time period for the introduction of anti-influenza drugs after the onset of symptoms [9]. Considering these problems and the continuous threat of influenza infection, our current utilization of multiplex RT-PCR testing requires improvement, which may increase the diagnostic sensitivity for influenza and decrease the number of patients who receive delayed therapy.",40.806037167814324,14.83250631445391

However, more rapid testing for respiratory viruses might improve the impact on clinical outcomes as results are available before any initial treatment or management is established by the treating physician. To our knowledge, this is the first review to specifically assess the clinical impact of rapid molecular tests, and not rapid antigen tests, without a restriction in the detection of influenza virus and RSV [45, 46]. The included studies, even the high-quality randomized studies [1, 20, 21, 24, 25], show heterogeneous results. The location of the rapid test, which was at the point of care in only 3 studies, may affect turnaround times and thereby clinical outcomes. Apart from other differences in design, and in analysis and power, differences in the implementation strategy might partially explain these discrepancies. First, education and training of personnel and physicians on the implemented rapid test, its diagnostic accuracy, and its potential effects on clinical outcomes may contribute to its effect on clinical outcomes [33]. Second, a combination of a rapid test and a result-based guideline on subsequent clinical management options might have more impact than a stand-alone diagnostic test, even though the 2 studies describing the implementation of a diagnostic bundle did not show any significant effects of their implementation, which might be partially explained by limited adherence to these guidelines [20, 21]. A complicating factor therein is that identification of a viral pathogen from a respiratory tract sample may not necessarily attribute causation [2]. Third, a combination of a rapid test and another diagnostic as procalcitonin [21, 30] or other biomarker-based assays [47] may increase the persuasiveness of the rapid viral test on whether there is a bacterial or viral causative pathogen. However, current evidence for the effect of the combination of respiratory viral testing and procalcitonin on clinical outcomes is disappointing [21].",38.74952729480694,14.600326769829099

Since the putative mechanism of action of the drug is to lead to mutations in cytosine bases (C > N mutagen by inhibition of CMP incorporation (49)), this dataset provides an ideal test-bed for studying quasi species dynamics of the dengue virus using samples from two time points (Table 3). In particular, an important conclusion of the original study was that despite encouraging results in in vitro studies, the drug did not work as expected in vivo (31). To investigate this aspect further, we compared the frequency of C > N mutations in the placebo group versus the drug group (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section) in dengue virus serotype 1, 2 and 3 (DENV1, DENV2 and DENV3) samples using LoFreq SNV calls (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). Our results indicate that no significant changes can be seen in this frequency for any serotype (Mann–Whitney test, P-value > 0.3), providing a molecular basis for the in vivo conclusion of this study. Despite this, we do detect other changes in viral intra-host variation, including an increase in the number of SNVs at later time points, as expected (one-sided Mann–Whitney test P-value < 0.007 for DENV1 placebo group), as well as the disappearance of a mutational hotspot in NS3 (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section) at a later time point, possibly due to adaptation to the host’s immune response (Figure 3).

Remarkably, the number of epidemiological investigations rapidly increased with age, beginning from when the first index case was aged > 13 years; this was probably due to the fact that this is a rapid period of growth in youths, and they spend longer times in high school.6 As reported by Fox et al.26 in 2013, contact investigation is known to be important for children, because unlike older age clusters, in congregated settings with many children, the risk of developing active TB is higher, and the response to the latent TB test is often unreliable; more controls are therefore required.",17.905292956757144,6.345413381908991

One bed per OR was assumed. For hospitals that did not report PACU beds, a 1.5:1 PACU beds-to-OR ratio was assumed and ORs were multiplied by 1.5. One ventilator was assumed per critical care bed.

Prior reports of the hospital course of care for COVID-19 patients showed that the vast majority of those admitted to the ICU were critical and only one-in-five of those who were critical survived, mostly because of ICU care. Thus, the percentage of critically ill patients that should have gone to the ICU but did not and survived should be much lower, likely only 5%; we therefore assumed a 95% mortality for patients that would have been placed in a critical care bed but did not because their local critical care bed capacity had been exceeded. 33",20.271541023704327,8.241339505770327

This assay platform should be of greatest utility for the development of disposable point-of-care devices. Despite performing multi-component analytical operations, the molecular computations are hidden from the user in a one-pot reaction that can both directly receive the sample and emanate visual results. We have previously demonstrated that the ready-to-use LAMP-OSD assay mixes can be lyophilized and stored for extended durations without loss of activity. 13 These various features should minimize device intricacies, and in turn reduce cost, especially since only two protein enzymes and a single fluorophore-quencher pair are required.

Address for Correspondence,"Regarding the degree of concordance between the two tests, the results reported in Table 1 clearly show that the precision of the rapidserological test Viva-Diag TM is unsatisfactory. Notably, only 43% of the patients that were COVID-19-positive with the molecular test were also positive with serological test. This figure is impressively similar to the performances reported for serological tests in Spain (11) and Germany (12). However, the first important information from our study concerns the 12% of cases that tested negative with molecular test but had positive serological results. The two tests do not produce similar results as would be obvious for assays that look at different aspects of Covid-19; in fact, the molecular test demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in samples from specific anatomical parts of the respiratory system while the kinetics of immunoglobulinsis devoted to describe as the body reacts to the viral infection. Negative serological test results in patients with a positive molecular test could mean that the latter are infected subjects that have not yet reached the stage of developing an immunoglobulin reaction; conversely, subjects whose serological tests show the presence of specific IgG and/or IgM antibodies and have negative molecular tests, may be considered as recovering from COVID-19. The data shown in Figure 1 seem to confirm these assumptions as the molecular test yielded more positive results in early symptomatic phases of the disease while the serological test performed better in the late phases of the disease (i.e. 10 days after symptom appearance).",19.2237089686484,6.8252235258134

More importantly, it showed that for viruses that rapidly create and exocytose new virions, release of additional assembled virions at the time of cell death does not significantly speed the spread of infection. Moreover, decreasing the cell tolerance to viral load does not drastically change the rate at which the infection spreads, but it does accelerate the rate of tissue damage and loss, which could potentially trigger edema and ARDS earlier. This 22 suggests that working to slow apoptosis may help preserve tissue integrity and delay adverse severe respiratory responses.
