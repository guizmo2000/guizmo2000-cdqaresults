These efforts not only need to focus on preventing transmission from livestock (mostly cattle) to humans, but also, and in parallel, to reduce the prevalence of the disease in both domestic and wildlife species. The availability of improved diagnostic tools for ZTB in different species, as well as the implementation of disease monitoring, surveillance, and prevention strategies in livestock and wildlife species will be a crucial and much needed component to be able to implement comprehensive programs that will account for the complexities ZTB poses due to its zoonotic nature.

Sharing of human resources, equipment and transport across sectors can reduce operational costs. This increased cost-effectiveness is especially relevant given the public funding constraints that often exist in settings where people are most at risk of zoonotic TB. For example, outreach childhood immunization campaigns or other existing livestock vaccination or testing programmes conducted in rural communities could be used to concurrently deliver educational and behavior change messages about food safety, to test livestock for bovine TB or, potentially in the future, to implement livestock vaccination campaigns against bovine TB.

Thus, RT-LAMP is useful for detecting RNA viruses. In addition, polymerase enzyme produces protons and subsequently leads to decreased pH in the presence of extensive DNA polymerase activity during LAMP reaction, thus facilitating real-time and simple detection of amplicons as observed by a change from pink to yellow color in the reaction solution [22] . The specificity and sensitivity of RT-LAMP are potentially comparable to those of existing PCR-based diagnostics with much shorter reaction time. Recently, influenza diagnostics tools leveraging RT-LAMP technology have been reported [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, most of these tools can only diagnose a single or a small number of human influenza viruses. Their ability to diagnose newly emerging viruses is limited.

With the advent of the measurement/sensing technologies that provided the ability of detecting trace substances in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid in vitro Diagnostics (IVD) have become a cornerstone of clinical practice. Solid phase immuno-assays such as ELISA [41] have long been established and are used extensively for diagnosis. The vast majority of sensing technologies used for molecular diagnostics are ensemble measurements, in other words they are analog. These immuno-assays have sensitivities in the picomolar range [42] . However, the serum concentrations of most protein biomarkers in the early stages of infection [43] are in the femtomolar range. To achieve the desired 3-order-of-magnitude improvement, a new class of biological sensing technologies have emerged relying on single molecule counting or digital detection, an approach that provides resolution and sensitivity not obtainable with ensemble measurements. Digital detection is a disruptive technology that can provide the necessary improvement in sensitivity. Furthermore, it is much easier to measure the presence or absence of signal than to detect the absolute amount of signal as it has long been recognized in communications and data recording. The advent of digital audio recording simplified the requirements of readout and allowed for reproduction of highest quality music without the expensive Hi-Fi equipment.

However, these temperature settings are not always possible in a field environment.

Furthermore, the hydrogel particles shrink at elevated temperatures above 34°C [23] , further trapping the analytes within the particles. We have expanded upon these findings by demonstrating that the Nanotrap particles can not only capture and enrich RVFV NP in the presence of abundant resident proteins that are found in serum, but also protect the viral antigen from degradation for at least 120 hours at both ambient and elevated temperatures.

This, however, also leads to the possibility of the same information being used to tailor ""precision harm"". It is well recognised that individuals can be targeted by biological weapons (MacIntyre and Engells 2016), but convergence of technology opens new avenues for precision harm of individuals. The catastrophic hacking of the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2014 (Mukherjee 2017) exposed data on over 20 million US Federal employees. At the same time, Anthem Health, the largest provider of health insurance to these employees, was also hacked (Tuttle 2016) . Data linkage would allow the perpetrators to access the sensitive personal medical information of employees, identify their medical vulnerabilities and plan targeted attacks, such as medication tampering or hacking of digital medical devices. The risks posed by hacking digital medical devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps are also cause for concern (Francies 2017) . This includes more extreme scenarios in which individuals with high political profiles or other strategic value could be assassinated by manipulation of their medical devices, tampering with their medication regimen or the design of microbial agents matched to their individual genetic profile. Former US Vice President Dick Cheney had his pacemaker wireless function disabled to mitigate such risk (Peterson 2016) . If hostile states, organised crime groups or terrorist gain digital medical information on defence or security professionals, government officials or judges, it may become a more attractive option to more obvious methods for causing harm. Figure 1 illustrates the potential for precision harm targeting high profile individuals, enabled by convergence of technologies. In the example provided, a federal judge could be targeted in several different ways, including biological weapons, hacking of digital medical devices, medication tampering, interference with scheduled medical procedures or use of toxins or immune modulators, once a roadmap for precision harm is created. This example could apply to linkage of data from the OPM and Anthem health hacks to create personalised medical profile for federal employees.

These sera contain a large and diverse amount of different antibodies with unknown specificities. However, polyclonal non-human antibodies may exhibit an immune response in human beings that hampers the therapeutic use for example after snake bites (12). Therefore, the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by hybridoma technology was a significant milestone (13) for the generation of antibodies for therapeutic use. As this technology is based on the fusion of antibody producing spleen cells from immunized mice or rats with immortal myeloma cell lines, its main obstacle is the inefficient immune response to highly toxic or conserved antigens. In addition, nearly all antibodies which are currently in clinical development are of human-origin or at least humanized in some aspect (9, 14, 15) to prevent immunogenicity. Consequently, Abbreviations: IgG, immunoglobulin G; mAb, monoclonal antibody. transgenic animals, especially mice, have been developed which contain a human immunoglobulin gene repertoire (16, 17) solving the problem of immunogenicity but not the need of an efficient immune response after immunization. Finally, in vitro selection technologies such as antibody phage display or ribosomal display provide a solution for the generation of human antibodies (18-22).",9.603573016010223,8.282191252796723

While microarrays offer a high degree of parallel processing for multiplex detection (hundreds or thousands of targets), microfluidics can streamline and automate the serial sample processing steps starting with crude, heterogeneous samples and yielding the requisite concentrated and purified nucleic acids for enzymatic amplification, microarray analysis, and sequencing. A 10-to 100-fold concentration of target for amplification is often needed. For example, the viral nucleic acid in 1 mL of blood plasma needs to be concentrated to a volume of about 10 µL for amplification. The ""backend"" functions of LOC molecular diagnostics systems which include amplification, labeling, and detection are well established. However, the ""front end"" functions of interfacing with the outside world through sample collection devices, as well as sample preparation and processing (lysis and NA isolation) of variegated heterogeneous samples are less developed.

Building upon a ""robust and transferable monovalent pilot process for egg-based inactivated whole virus influenza A vaccine production,"" next steps are being planned for work under this technology platform [39] . Such technology platforms might be potentially developed for other diagnostic and therapeutic areas to accelerate innovation. The strategic management of intellectual property rights is central to securing access to these building blocks of knowledge [40] . Even when publicly funded, patented inventions may not be easily accessible by other researchers or for use in disease-endemic countries. There may be even less incentive to share when such inventions are proprietary and privately funded. However, especially in the neglected disease space, both tiering and pooling arrangements have afforded greater access to needed research inputs. By tiering, preferential discounts or even royalty-free access to research inputs is provided, often bounded by field of use or geography. For AIDS drugs and many vaccines, tiered pricing arrangements offer price breaks to resource-limited countries.

The technology can randomly amplify and detect all the pathogens that may be present in a sample, enabling universal unbiased pathogen detection. Unfortunately, this random amplification results in the amplification of all the nucleic acids, including host nucleic acids, which are more abundant than the pathogen nucleic acids. Therefore, millions of reads need to be analyzed to identify the pathogen(s) of interest. This drawback is one of the major hurdles that has delayed the implementation of the technology in the diagnostic laboratory because of the number of reagents that have to be used for deep sequencing and the need for curated databases to accurately evaluate such large data sets (8, 9) . An alternative to metagenomic sequencing is targeted NGS. Targeted NGS refers to the selective capture or amplification of specific genomic regions of interest prior to massive parallel sequencing. Compared to metagenomic sequencing, the possibility of targeted sequencing discovering new pathogens is limited. However, selectively sequencing pathogens of interest provides better sensitivity, better specificity, ease of downstream analysis, and lower cost by allowing more samples to be tested in one run (10) . Targeted NGS has been applied successfully in cancer diagnostics (11) (12) (13) . All of these advantages suggest that targeted NGS can be used for syndromic testing by providing a comprehensive diagnostic assay for the detection of known, clinically relevant pathogens from a variety of specimens, particularly for cases that present nonspecific disease signs that may be associated with multiple infectious agents. Therefore, in this study, we tested 60 clinical samples (including tissues, feces, and milk) with the targeted NGS assay, along with routine diagnostic methods, to evaluate the feasibility of applying a targeted NGS technique to syndromic testing (for mastitis, enteritis, and respiratory and reproductive disease) in a clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory.",8.438337529619705,6.657507550440291

Isolation of the causal agent provides an irrefutable proof of an infection and allows pathogen identification and determination of antibiotic susceptibility. However, many microorganisms are unculturable, fastidious, or slow-growing. Additionally, prior antimicrobial treatment negatively affects culture-based tests. In the case of bloodstream infections, lack of detection is critical. A significant percentage of blood cultures are negative despite the high likelihood of a bacterial or fungal infection [2] . Lack of culturability and the time to answer mean that many septic patients are not appropriately treated. PCR/ESI-MS is a robust technology that offers a rapid alternative for the diagnosis of bloodstream as well as other infections. Although being not currently commercially available, the new presentation of the technology has been improved in several aspects that significantly enhance sensitivity. The main advantage of this technology is that it can be used on direct patient specimens, avoiding the culture step. Using this technology as a complement to conventional methods will offer a real improvement in the management of septic and other critically ill patients (i.e., patients suffering from meningitis or fever of unknown origin).

Access to decentralized molecular diagnostic testing can enable faster diagnostics, treatments, and subsequent control of infectious diseases. A critical challenge to efforts in decentralizing molecular diagnostic testing is that a large segment of the population in need of these advances resides in low-resource settings (LRS) that offer extremely limited laboratory infrastructure [3, 4] . While many well-characterized molecular assays have been developed around polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [5, 6] , including pathogen and infectious disease detection [7] [8] [9] , food and water safety [10] [11] [12] , forensics [13, 14] , population-scale polymorphisms [15, 16] , and mutation studies [17] , it remains largely a laboratory technique requiring expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus, PCR-based devices for molecular diagnostics have not been appropriately commercialized for geographical areas and demographics that would benefit most from the technology. Besides the cost and temperature-sensitivity of reagents, thermal cyclers are generally much too expensive to be purchased for users in these areas. In addition, the timescales required to perform a typical PCR remain slow, generally about an hour or more. This is partially due to the large thermal masses of most commercial thermal cyclers that make the process very inefficient. To this end, many innovative methods aimed at performing PCR faster have been reported [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Although these approaches provide valuable scientific innovation, most of them are difficult to implement in LRS. In short, there remains an unmet need for a rapid and low-cost thermal cycler that can carry out molecular diagnostics in rural areas and developing countries in a rapid and low-cost manner.",9.429844232897,8.348894568656894

To improve the significance of this experiment, here we used the whole E2-Fc fusion protein (E2 340 -Fc) as a ligand. The Fc domain alone served as a negative control. Ninety-six-well plates were either coated with recombinant full-length gp120 (gp120 IIIB [Immuno Diagnostics, 1001-10], and gp120 MN [Immune Technology, IT-001-002MNp]), expressed in eukaryotic cells, or with gp41, expressed in E. coli, consisting of the complete (gp41 IIIB [Abcam, ab68129]) or truncated gp41 ectodomain (gp41 MN [NIH, 12027] ). In gp41 MN , the hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP), the transmembrane region (TM), and most of the C-terminal part of the cytoplasmic tail (CP) were omitted (illustrated in Figure 5A ).

In fact, veterinary diagnostics in Europe has proved to be a very effective network of institutions studying epizootic diseases.

The continuous innovations in various kinds of digital technology have rendered the current teaching methods much more diverse than those of the past. Teaching methods have undergone immense changes. The ""flipped classroom"" method that has been widely discussed in recent years is a new teaching method that has attracted the attention of educators worldwide. As its name suggests, the core concept of the flipped classroom is to ""flip"" the teaching model; it aims to change the traditional teaching model, in which ""teachers teach the content of the curriculum while students discuss and practice after lessons and then complete assignments,"" to a newer way of attending class, in which ""students watch videos of the curriculum content prepared by their teachers for them, engage in discussions and practices in class, and then complete their assignments"" [5] . In both European and American teachers' networks, the flipped classroom has been one of the most fervently searched keywords in the past few years and has been implemented in many classrooms today because the maturity of modern science and technology has made the production of teaching videos remarkably easy [6, 7] . In addition, there are already significant video resources on YouTube or other websites that can be utilized. Secondary school teachers have proposed an idea that calls for allowing students to watch the teaching videos at home and using class time for exercises, experiments, group discussions, asking questions, summarizing main points, or other in-depth learning activities [8] .",7.720267734319852,8.247349177287827

To implement a successful POC diagnostics programme, the engagement of policy makers, stakeholders and partners to ensure buy-in and align necessary resources is a critical first step. Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes. Another key barrier to the appropriate use of POC diagnostics is the need to train clinicians to create a demand for them and then use the test results to effectively manage the patients.

A large proportion of MERS-CoV cases have been the result of human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings (2, 3) ; outbreaks have occurred in several countries, with the largest outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and South Korea (4). Dromedary camels are the putative reservoir hosts for MERS-CoV; they experience no or mild symptoms upon infection (5) . Primary infection can occur from dromedary camels to humans, and new cases with evidence of camel contact continue to occur sporadically (6) . MERS-CoV is 1 of the 10 high-threat pathogens on the WHO Research and Development Blueprint (7) , a document that sets out a roadmap for research and development of diagnostics, preventive and therapeutic products for prevention, and early detection and response to these high-priority pathogens. The WHO roadmap for MERS-CoV lists several priority activities, including improved diagnostics and vaccines for humans and camels as well as basic and translational research (8) . Serologic assays are critical for the evaluation of the efficacy of new vaccines and patient treatment, as are diagnostic tools to confirm infections and perform serosurveillance. A variety of serologic assays have been developed globally, both commercially and in-house; however, there is no evidence supporting the quality of performance of these assays and their consistency with one another. Participants at the WHO intercountry meeting on MERS-CoV in Cairo, Egypt, June 20-22, 2013, recognized this issue as a public health priority and called for a study to compare currently available serologic assays (9) . Therefore, we assembled a panel of human serum or plasma and polyclonal antibodies to compare the performance of serologic assays for MERS-CoV. We invited participants to use their testing algorithms to diagnose each sample as if it were a real patient sample. The assays were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity. Pas et al. described in 2015 the impact that a single international standard would have on reducing interlaboratory variability for MERS-CoV diagnostics (albeit in this case for NAT assays) (10) .

These technologies are extraordinarily promising for future diagnostic devices, particularly as new biomarkers of infectious diseases are discovered in surface biofluids such as sweat. 569 Recent advances in microprojection 570,571 and microneedle 572,573 technology have allowed researchers to expand the use of skin-based wearables beneath the surface of skin. In several applications, patches consisting of many microprojections were easily applied to the skin with a gentle press and could draw hundreds of microliters of blood with little-to-no pain. 567,574−576 In 2014, Lee et al. 567 outlined the design of a multiplexed patch that captured both IgG and malarial biomarker HRP2 from the skin of inoculated mice. The patch consisted of microprojection arrays (MPAs) that were subsequently functionalized with anti-HRP2 antibodies, Fc-specific antimouse IgG antibodies, and antidengue antibodies. The anti-HRP2-functionalized MPAs detected the biomarker, while the anti-IgG-functionalized MPAs acted as a positive control for skin penetration, and the antidenguefunctionalized MPA served as a negative control. Though sample collection and preparation were applicable at the point of use, the assay required an ELISA for colorimetric readout of the captured antigen. Further research into integration of this technology with a diagnostic such as a stacked paper-based assay would allow for real-time skin-based monitoring of infectious diseases.",8.670887926918507,8.448296587562346

This emphasis is reflected in the fact that the bulk of the health care expenditures in the United States-$1.3 trillion in 2000 -is spent on medical care interventions. 20 Although no official data are collected on PHT expenditures, such investment is likely insignificant compared with support for medical technology research and development (R&D). For example, pharmaceutical companies belonging to a major industry trade group invested more than $30 billion in R&D in 2001 21 ; this investment does not include expenditures by other medical care industries, such as device and equipment manufacturers.

Nucleic acid-based pathogen detection is here to stay and in the short-tomedium term the technologies discussed in this review will be at the forefront of this. However, the manner in which molecular diagnostics will be performed in the more distant future is less clear. The formats used will undoubtedly evolve rapidly, with the evolution driven by the ingenuity of engineers, the commercial imperatives of scientific equipment manufacturers and the R&D strategies of large pharmaceutical companies. Certainly in the case of fledgling technologies such as microarrays, where much of the technology is still geared towards the researcher, there is considerable scope for the development of more diagnostics-friendly formats in the next few years. For in-field testing the drivers are coming from a different area, primarily that of military and counterterrorism with a need for very rapid testing out in the 'field', be that a battlefield or a mail room. However, from the period of change that confronts us in the future, certain general themes are easy to predict. One of these is the increased use of automation, allowing genuine high-throughput testing (i.e. large numbers of samples) to occur. Given the issues of labour costs, health and safety (e.g. repetitive strain injury), and reproducibility, the increasing use of automation to perform previously labour-intensive procedures will inevitably occur. One obvious repercussion of such develop-ments will be the move towards larger, capitalequipment rich, centralised diagnostic laboratories. The second major trend that can be foreseen is the continued development of generic detection systems, resulting in much less reliance on the kinds of parallel testing often seen in diagnostic laboratories today. The development of arraybased technologies, based on either hybridisation, amplification or both, is sure to feature heavily in this. The third significant change that will occur as a direct result of the increased use of molecular techniques will be the replacement of some techniques, especially the slower, more expensive biological methods e.g. grafting or bait testing. While this replacement will initially be gradual, and might possibly never result in the complete extinction of such techniques (especially where generation of live cultures of the pathogen are a legal requirement), it will undoubtedly become more rapid as funding bodies continue to demand cost-saving efficiencies and hard decisions have to be made on what equipment and facilities are bought and maintained. Finally, as centralised laboratory facilities become 'geared-up' for high throughput testing, and as a result become specialised in handling large sample numbers in an automated fashion, there will be a drive away from low sample number, rapid-response diagnosis being performed in these facilities. These diagnoses will be carried out by inspectors at a point of entry (e.g. an airport, port or border crossing) rather than scientists in remote laboratories. At this point, the discipline of plant pathogen molecular diagnostics will have finally come of age.",8.84482962539716,7.678319584606322

Metal-Based Signal,"As the blood glucose meter clearly demonstrates, portable electrochemical instrumentation has enabled minimally trained users to measure analytes at the point of care and rapidly obtain information regarding their health status. Mobile health technologies (i.e., mobile phones and telemedicine) augment these advances in instrumentation, connecting individual users to an entire healthcare infrastructure. Mobile health technologies are useful for tracking patient information and facilitating communication between the patient and the care provider. As these technologies mature, they are becoming increasingly important for modeling diseases and disease trends throughout various populations. 563 Integration of portable electrochemical diagnostics with mobile health technologies in so-called ""connected"" diagnostics has been pursued by interfacing electrochemical devices with mobile phones. 173, 564 Nemiroski and colleagues 173 developed a universal mobile electrochemical detector (uMED) that combined a potentiostat with virtually any mobile phone using audio-based data transmission ( Figure 37B ). The device could accommodate several electrochemical techniques (amperometry, coulometry, voltammetry, and potentiometry), and the voice system-based data ensured broad compatibility with a variety of mobile phones and networks. The authors employed the uMED to detect blood glucose, heavy metals in water, electrolytes, and malarial biomarker HRP2. Following sample collection and measurement using the potentiostat, the user placed a phone call to a Skype number in a remote location to vocally report the value of the analyte measured. The remote application then extracted the value from the audio data and sent an SMS message back to the user with additional diagnostic information (e.g., ""LOW"" if the reported blood glucose level was low). Although the uMED was applied to detect an infectious disease biomarker (HRP2), it is limited by the availability of existing compatible testing technology. For instance, HRP2 detection required an offline 96-well plate ELISA to be conducted prior to analysis on the uMED and transmission over a mobile network. As more progress is made in electrochemical diagnostic design, the uMED and other similar devices will be able to reach their full potential as ""connected"" diagnostics.",9.044988842932032,7.586203386629299

It seems obvious, also for many international experts [11, 47] , that the main direction in a near future diagnostic will be associated with any whole genome sequencing methods, but it is really hard to foresee on which technology, because of the speed of technology development. Sanger sequencing method, developed in the year 1977 is also still in use [48] , but nowadays it is widely supplanted by newer, Next Generation Sequencing methods. However, currently the life span of these modern methods is much shorter. For example pyrosequencing based sequencing technology was considered modern a few years ago [49] . Now it is widely replaced by more popular Illumina technology [50] . But even Illumina can also be easily supplanted by newer techniques, for example those that are able to produce much longer reads. And that is why more and more laboratories are implementing e.g. more modern PacBio technology [51] . That is also the problem with prediction, whether Nanopore sequencing technology [52] , that can be considered as a real revolution in the field of nucleic acids sequencing, will constitute a basic diagnostic technique in the future. Maybe the existing problems with the throughput (maybe solved by introducing of bigger equipment like PromethION), quite high error rate (but lower in each new generation of the flow cell and chemistry) or lack of easily accessible and ""microbiologist friendly"" software will make the technology soon replaced by another one. Nevertheless, nowadays such WGS analysis looks like the best choice for rapid diagnostics of highly dangerous pathogens.

Careful consideration must be given to selecting which methods to take forward and apply in aquaculture. Vaccines need to be cost-effective and safe, and pathogen detection methods should be robust yet sensitive. There are many innovative technologies that may fulfi l these criteria and provide new vaccines and useful diagnostics tools. It is important, however, that the diagnostics methods already developed are standardised and fully validated, if they are considered useful, and that new technologies do not supersede these just because they are novel methods. They need to have clear advantages over the existing methods for use in aquaculture. Nanotechnology is an area being explored for the detection of pathogens in food (Kim et al., 2007) and in clinical and veterinary diagnostics, and this may prove extremely useful for application in diagnostics for aquatic animals. Nanotechnology is generally used when referring to materials of 0.1-100 nanometres; however, it is also inherent that these materials should display different properties from bulk (or micrometric and larger) materials as a result of their size. These differences include physical strength, chemical reactivity, electrical conductance, magnetism and optical effects. Such technology offers the ability to detect extremely low levels of pathogens very quickly, and progress has already been made for the identifi cation of foodborne pathogens (Joseph and Morrison, 2006) . Recently, the focus is on different types of sensors to detect pathogens and immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) technology has been reported for the detection of low levels of the H5N1 virus that causes bird fl u (Yang et al., 2008) . In this method magnetic nanoparticles were coated with antibody and a high-transition-temperature superconductive quantum interference device was used to sense the immunomagnetic reduction of the reagents.",13.400010712247408,11.153504105960788

Third, many proteins are prone to denature or degrade in standard buffer conditions and at ambient temperature, making them substantially more challenging to study. Therefore, technology for systematically assaying protein function that is both highthroughput and highly flexible is urgently needed. The past success of the DNA microarray technology highlights the power of a highly parallel, high-throughput platform that allows profiling of thousands of molecular targets in a single experiment.

Here to increase the accuracy, a strand displacing DNA polymerase is used to sequence the same template several times (Travers et al. 2010) . DNA polymerase and template immobilize at the base of the ZMW where DNA synthesis takes place (Levene et al. 2003) . Approximately 75K ZMWs/SMRT cells are present allowing 75K single-molecule reactions in parallel fashion. There is concept of physics, which does not allow the laser light (600 nm) to pass completely through the ZMWs (because of zepto-litre holes) and it decays exponentially after entering into ZMW. Thus, the laser light only illuminates the 30 nm of the hole. Phospholinked nucleotides of all four types subsequently pass over the ZMWs. The nucleotides get excited and fluoresce when reaching the base because laser cannot penetrate up within the hole. Therefore, nucleotides cannot be fluoresced till they are present on the surface of the hole. Hence, polymerization reaction takes place continuously; fluorescent signals can be detected in real time so the sequence can be read (Eid et al. 2009 ).

Compatibility with standard microelectronic fabrication and miniaturization of DNA chips provide a cost-effective solution for mass production. The fabrication technology, specifically microelectromechanical systems technology [111] , is capable of creating precise geometrical structures of sub-micrometer scale on solid substrates. The structures utilized include nanowires, microfluidic channels, stripes, wells, etc. [112, 113] . Thus, in conjunction with basic mechanical automations and software, the chip can handle various tasks previously dependent on human operations. The chip can also integrate laboratory procedures, such as microfluidic systems, exchange of aqueous solutions, temperature control in a reaction chamber, providing optimum conditions for hybridization, post-hybridization detection and data analysis. The idea of developing an all-in-one, fully automatic system for completing an entire analysis protocol led to the creation of the laboratory-on-a-chip (LOAC) system. LOAC greatly simplifies the high-throughput analysis since human involvement is minimal. The automation also provides operational convenience and ensures repeatable results. It should also be able to offer very rapid multiple detections with high sensitivity and specificity, thus reducing the cost.

Rapid advances in molecular methods have led to the development of sensitive and specific nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests which strengthen our ability to diagnose, treat and control infectious diseases that cause public health problems. We have reviewed several popular and important nucleic acidbased diagnostic methods, many of which have the potential to be used in the clinic.

The lack of success is not due to problems with micro fl uidic devices; for example, drug screening requires high-throughput methods to fi nd and test different drug candidates. Micro fl uidic high-throughput screening (HTS) techniques have been applied to drug discovery to perform thousands of tests in parallel with some success (162) (163) (164) . As of now these methods haven't been applied in micro fl uidic diagnostics for several reasons. Current diagnostics are typically performed in large hospitals or reference labs. In these labs, most tests are Cardiac STATus™ Not reported ( 142 ) batched and performed using robots in a highly parallel, high throughput approach. Replacing these robots by using micro fl uidics is unlikely in the short term due to the large infrastructure already developed. Essentially, a solution to this problem already exists, so adoption of micro fl uidics for these assays will only occur if there are compelling assay improvements. In addition, if an assay can be performed in a batch mode using micro fl uidics, it is likely to be able to be performed in the clinic or POC setting, and for nearly the same price. Thus, micro fl uidics is likely to be driven to the POC rather than to large reference laboratories. The reverse of high-throughput screening (multiple samples with one target) is multiplexed screening, where one sample is tested for multiple agents or biomarkers. A few examples of multiplexed screening have already been provided, especially for cardiac biomarkers, but highly multiplexed diagnostics are still being developed. Multiplexed screening is likely to have a more signi fi cant impact on diagnostics than high throughput screening, especially with the move towards personalized medicine. Micro fl uidics has been combined with microarray technology, which is used regularly in genomics and proteomics, and which will likely have diagnostic applications in the future; however, this is beyond the scope of the chapter. More relevant are micro fl uidic devices that can diagnose multiple diseases simultaneously. A recently released product that uses ""mesoscale"" fl uidics can simultaneously diagnose 15 respiratory diseases associated with viruses ( 165 ) . A challenge with getting the device to commercialization is that regulatory agencies such as the FDA require individual validation of each assay, meaning that multiplexing must clear very challenging regulatory requirements, which will likely limit substantial multiplexing in the near future. Nevertheless, micro fl uidics will probably lead to highly multiplexed assays that can perform 100s or 1,000s of diagnostic assays on one sample. About 1,200 patents related to micro fl uidics have been issued in the USA through 2010. In spite of immense academic interest in micro fl uidics and signi fi cant research investment directed towards both academic and industrial organizations, relatively few commercial products based on micro fl uidics have been introduced into the market ( 166, 167 ) ; however, the rate of introduction is increasing and many barriers are coming down. One of the reasons cited for lack of commercial success is the lack of a potential ""blockbuster"" end-user product that could generate billions of dollars in revenue. Until the industry can fi nd a product with high volume demand, the fabrication costs due to lack of ""economies of scale"" are going to remain high.

However, the road to this destination is filled with regulatory requirements and societal concerns, to which the technological and practitioner communities must be cognizant and responsive. Furthermore, the technology, in its current format, is labor-intensive and quite expensive. There is need for alternative formats that focus on specific diagnostic or prognostic applications within targeted disease states. Better methods of manufacture and detection are being developed, including direct detection of hybridization by electric current, based on the fact that single-stranded DNA conducts electrons at a different rate than double-stranded DNA. In the near future, nucleic acid nanotechnology may prove very useful in DNA diagnostics. Research has led to advanced nucleic acid nanostructures and devices, semisynthetic DNA-protein conjugates, and efficient assembly of individual oligonucleotidefunctionalized nanoparticles in two-and three-dimensional networks (53) . Some of these assemblies have already proven useful for diagnostic purposes (54, 55) and the construction of nanometer-sized DNA-based nanowires has been achieved (56). The latter have been incorporated into a DNA-based two-dimensional network of functional scaffolds for protein arrays.

However, ultimately success and the true measure of innovation are judged by the level of adoption into the application sectors for which the technology was intended. Ultimate success depends on clear definition of the problem being addressed, as well as the capability of the end-user organization to adopt the solution. At the present time, adoption of the LOC concept has been greater in the research setting than in any other setting. While clinical diagnostics have been highlighted in the foregoing discussion, there may be other arenas where application of both LOC and POC testing offers potential benefits, e.g., in environmental, food, and material authenticity testing. Speed, simplicity, and mobility are all desirable attributes, while financial and environmental issues are equally applicable to all modalities of testing. There is no doubt that it is in these markets that the greatest volume of applications are to be found. However, we know from the experience of POC testing (see Point-of-Care Testing) that adoption has been slow, and furthermore, barriers to the adoption of new technologies in health care have been acknowledged. One of the key barriers is a poor understanding of the unmet need that might be addressed by the new technology. While it might be self-evident that an analytical device should address an unmet need, it is recognized in clinical diagnostics that there is significant over-requesting of tests, which is probably encouraged by the predominance of the fee-for-service business model. Furthermore, there is a lesson to be learned from the evolution of central laboratory analytical technology, where the early approach to ""scope"" was through the development of the ""multichannel analyzer."" It became evident after wide adoption of this technology that patients were being tested for analytes (or biomarkers) that were not necessarily relevant to their condition. This raised two issues. First, whether the patient (or the insurer) should have to pay for tests not required and second, a proportion of abnormal results were reported that were not relevant to the clinical condition being investigated. The consequence of this experience was the development of the discretionary analyzer, with a greater emphasis on ""relevant"" biomarkers or ""groups of biomarkers."" Consequently, while scope is a major attribute of the LOC concept, it presents a greater challenge to formulating the right ""group of biomarkers"" and demonstrating clinical utility. The ethical issues surrounding the generation of results not requested, referred to in the earlier discussion also has to be considered, as well as the growing demand for evidence of clinical utility as part of the patient demand for an improved quality of health care service.",10.982341182940974,7.555205069432478

Simple Microscopy is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis but in local health centers with restricted resources, malaria is diagnosed presumptively in patients with fever. 100 Other new technologies include Immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that provide an alternative to microscopy at the point of care though carries certain limitation like decreased sensitivity at lower levels of Parasitaemia inhibition at high levels of parasitaemia (prozone effect), inability to quantitate or distinguish malaria species in mixed infections, and failure to detect parasites with mutations in the genes encoding certain target antigens.

Thus this study contributes to the front-line malaria diagnosis, eradication programs and other preclinical trials. Thus it is predicted that hydrogels are novel candidate to be used in molecular diagnostics platform in developing countries. 106 ",12.875128220276263,9.625378686949292

For example, the availability of various sequence databases permits quick identification of sequence identity and variations. For example, the HIV database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ contains data on HIV genetic sequences and drug resistance associated mutations. It is valuable for HIV epidemiological studies, research, development, and clinical validation studies of HIV clinical assays [38, 71] . It is well known that there are significant variations of clinical phenotypes in the presence of emerging infections ranging from asymptomatic carrier to lethal infection. Recently, assays to examine multiple pathogen panels have been developed [97À102], which should increase the diagnostic yield for many pathogens. A critical need for emerging pathogen analysis is quicker, easier, cost-effect assays that can be used in a point-of-care setting. New assays that are performed on platforms with a small footprint and detect pathogens quickly (in minutes instead of hours or days) have entered clinical use. For example, the FilmArray (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.) and Simplexa (Focus Diagnostics, Inc.) molecular assays can generate results in approximately 60 min. The user-friendly Alere i (Alere Inc.) and Cobas Liat (Roche Molecular Systems) platforms are compact and portable, generate rapid molecular results in 15À20 min, can use electricity or rechargeable battery, and therefore are completely mobile and suited for point-of-care testing.

For many years, the phenotypic appearance of the organism on a selective or differential agar plate, along with biochemical assays to detect carbohydrate utilization and enzymes within the organism defined the methods of identification. As more laboratories adopt the newer methods, the phenotypic and biochemical data become much less important. Mass spectrometry methods are being utilized in more routine clinical laboratories and can now be used for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Investigators are currently exploring methods to use mass spectrometry for strain typing and susceptibility testing, but there is more work to be done in this area, which has not yet been shown to have enough discriminatory power for use in patient care. PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is another technology that has large potential for the future of microbiological diagnostics. This is a method capable of identifying nearly all human pathogens of different types without requiring the establishment of a predesigned panel of candidate microbes for testing. This is a unique feature because most assays test for the presence of specific organisms. The method combines a PCR step with a mass spectrometry time-of-flight analyzer to identify the nucleic acid base composition of the PCR products produced in a multiplex PCR reaction. Resulting nucleotide sequence must be analyzed against a reference database of genomic sequences to identify the organisms present. This technology is primarily used for research, food testing, public health surveillance, or biopharmaceutical testing at this time and has not yet been adopted into the routine clinical microbiology laboratory.

Two relatively new companies have been working on methodologies that will further disrupt clinical microbiology practices. T2 Biosystems, Inc. has recently received FDA approval for the detection of fi ve Candida species ( C. albicans , C. tropicalis , C. parapsilosis , C. krusei , and C. glaboratoryrata ) direct from the patient's blood sample without prior incubation within a blood culture bottle. The T2 Biosystems assay claims to detect these Candida species within 5 h. This technology shortens start time for appropriate Candidemia treatment. Patient mortality is decreased, the earlier treatment is started [ 142 ] . Having the ability to identify the particular Candida species is critical since C. glaboratoryrata and C. krusei have signifi cant rates of azole resistance [ 143 , 144 ] . Similar to the other blood culture tests mentioned above, this technology will not eliminate the need for culture/PCR and antimicrobial susceptibility testing after a blood culture bottle becomes positive. The technology allows for processing of the whole blood sample, since a thermostable mutated DNA polymerase that is not affected by inhibitors in whole blood detection is used to amplify DNA. Detection of any PCR product is done via T2 Magnetic Resonance technology. ( www.t2biosystems.com ). Clinical trials data show an overall sensitivity of 91.1 % with a mean time of 4.4 h for detection and species identifi cation [ 144 ] . The limit of Other studies have demonstrated earlier detection and its effect on antimicrobial stewardship [ 145 , 146 ] . Because this is a relatively new technology, hospitals and other healthcare institutions are currently determining the most optimal and cost effective way to utilize this technology.

But the hybridoma technology has drawbacks like limited number of candidates, possible instability of the aneuploid cell lines [94] , inability to provide antibodies against highly conserved antigens and most of all its limited application to generate human antibodies [130] .

However, their therapeutic applications are limited because repeated administration of murine antibodies can cause human anti-mouse antibody reaction (HAMA), reducing antibody half-life and have severe side effects including anaphylactic shock [26] . A strategy to circumvent these problems is antibody humanization or the use of transgenic animals where the original antibody gene repertoire is replaced with a human gene repertoire [34, 57, 70, 85] .

The next major advance will be the incorporation of DNA chip technology into routine diagnostics. Probes are bound to a solid phase for detection of unknown, 'interrogated', DNA. The use of a solid phase to bind probes is not novel, being used in commercial PCR systems, but DNA chips involve a very large array of probes of known sequence on a solid surface, 'the chip'.

With the increasing recognition that most bacteria are yet to be recognised, DNA chip technology, allied to sequencing, may speed up the process of establishing true bacterial biodiversity. Biosensor technology to detect binding of bound probe also offers the prospect of rapid through-put and automation.

The linear motion of the sliding strip acted as a valve to control all processing steps. The probe's fluorescence was detected using a hand-held ultraviolet source, achieving an LOD of z5 cells. Roll-to-roll thermal imprinting (molding) technology was proposed for the fabrication of integrated PDMSepaper microfluidic device for molecular diagnostics [53] . This technology enabled the scaling up of production to thousands of devices in an hour (Fig. 3C) . The mold was made by photolithography on a nickel plate. The PDMS coating and pattern replication were performed on Alcoated paper. The metal coating effectively suppressed the paper's auto-fluorescence and enhanced fluorescence intensity, due to its high reflectivity. A rolling cylinder was used to transfer microfluidic structures in PDMS by thermal imprinting. The performance of this integrated device was validated by the detection of viral RNA by LAMP.

Traditionally, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) with mass spectrometry has been the basis of proteomic technology. 43 Although this technique has provided rich information about individual proteins, its clinical usefulness for the study of the proteome is limited. The limitations of this technique for clinical diagnostics are primarily due to low sample throughput compared with other techniques. Additionally, there are technical challenges relating to the reproducibility of the 2-D gels, the relatively low numbers of proteins that can be resolved on each gel and the limited sensitivity (ie low abundant proteins are not easily identified). Modern proteomics technology, as discussed in several recent reviews, is developing quickly and is focused on mass spectrometry-based serum pattern profiling and protein microarrays in continuing efforts to discover new molecular markers and therapeutic targets in human cancer. 44 -46 The use of serum proteomic pattern analysis has created diagnostic signatures for ovarian, 47, 48 breast, 49 prostate 50 and liver cancers. 51 In the Laboratory of Pathology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this proteome-based strategy is being used for early detection of ovarian cancer in high-risk women.

To this scope, the ""ASSURED"" criteria were developed [35] to summarize the characteristics of the ideal diagnostic test for the developing world, which should be Affordable by the target groups; Sensitive and Specific; User-friendly by limited trained personnel; Rapid and Robust; Equipment-free; and Delivered to those in need. These criteria were initially developed for sexually transmitted infections but are generic for developing countries-targeted diagnostics. However, it has been evident that the users' requirements call for elaboration (or ""fine-tuning"") of these criteria. For example, the ""equipment-free"" criterion may be risky, because saving the test results in the device decreases the risk of mis-interpretation by inexperienced personnel. Therefore, there is an increasing trend to use mobile technology to read results provided by Lateral Flow Tests (LFTs). Moreover, there is need for guidance on how to select patients who should be tested, interpret test results in the clinical context, and triage patients who should be referred and admitted due to severe illness. In case of epidemics, where several patients arrive simultaneously at the checkpoint, the capacity of the tool to process several samples at the same time is an advantage. The ASSURED criteria, together with additional specific requirements, are summarized in Target Product Profiles (TPPs), which technology developers should meet during their development stages.

Microarray procedures require many complex, often manual, steps that are prone to errors and need skilled staff and expensive equipment for processing. One way to overcome these shortcomings might be automation of the process steps using LoC devices that allow for a convenient and reproducible processing of patient samples with minimized risk for handling errors or contamination. Diagnostic assays beginning from sample preparation up to and including data readout and processing can be easily performed using such systems. This might be the most promising path for microarrays to find their way into clinical laboratory diagnostics at a larger scale.",12.70488093590985,8.803200584686673

For photolithography, premade masks or digital micromirror devices are used. Premade masks are used by the Affymetrix platform. For every nucleotide (nt) added to the growing strand on the solid support, a mask covering regions on the microarray where no base addition should take place is applied. Previous nucleotide blocking groups are removed by a photosensitive reaction after UV light-induced deprotection, and the extension by one further nucleotide can take place. The technology is rather expensive due to mask costs. Every array design needs its own set of masks. Usually, probes are 20-25 nt in length, and 22-40 probes per gene are synthesized. Another photolithography technology is used by NimbleGen: single-nucleotide extension is performed by light-mediated inactivation of a photolabile protective group and afterward a base addition. This is similar to the Affymetrix technology. However, NimbleGen uses micromirror devices that can lead the light needed for inactivation of protective groups to every desired spot on the microarray. Therefore, there is no need for masks anymore which makes this technology much cheaper. Another technology for making microarrays is the piezoelectric ink-jet printing technology, also called HP technology deduced from HP printing technology. The Agilent sure print technology is an example for an industrial platform. They produce cDNA or oligonucleotide microarrays. cDNA is spotted directly, oligonucleotides are synthesized base-by-base in repetitive print layers using standard phosphoramidite chemistry (https://www. chem.agilent.com/Library/technicaloverviews/Public/5988-8171en.pdf). The most widely used technology for microarray production especially in the field of research institutions and universities is the robot spotting technology: e.g., proteins, PCR products or oligonucleotides are spotted on a solid glass support using split or solid pins. Using split pins, DNA is fed in by capillary forces and deposited at defined locations on the microarray using robot technology. Usually, PCR products up to 1 kb and oligonucleotides between 20 and 100 nts in length are printed. This technology is affordable and therefore often used in individual research labs. Next to these classical technologies, also semiconductor-based systems have been developed. For example, CombiMatrix uses such a system for the production of their microarrays. Thousands of platinum microelectrodes can be addressed simultaneously to synthesize individual oligonucleotides by digitally controlled synthesis. The activation of a microelectrode leads to the production of an acid by an electrochemical reaction. This leads to the deprotection of the growing oligonucleotide strand activating it for the next synthesis step. The possibility to individually address thousands of microelectrodes in parallel allows the comfortable production of individual microarrays (Ghindilis et al. 2007 ). Over 12,000 oligos are synthesized in parallel as 50 mers.",9.07699505658795,7.9240577187155425

However, not all diagnostic tests fi nd their way to application in health care. For some, clinical utility may not be demonstrated due to the lack of an actionable result, cost-effectiveness, high-throughput methods, or adequate reimbursement. For example, early asymptomatic glaucoma testing was widely abandoned because early detection did not affect the outcome. Other tests may not achieve the analytical performance characteristics required of a good diagnostic. Assay sensitivity, specifi city, and predictive value must be high (Gaeta, 2005 ) . Reproducible precision and a clinically reportable range must be demonstrated ( Irwig, et al., 2002 ) . For example, before microarray technology can be translated widely to diagnostic applications, problems with sensitivity and reproducibility will have to solved ( Petrik, 2006 ) . A rigorous evaluation of diagnostic tests prior to their introduction into clinical practice is the goal of the standards for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy (STARD) initiative ( Bossuyt et al., 2003 ) and evaluation of genomic applications in practice and prevention (EGAPP), a CDC project to establish an evidence-based process for assessing applications of genomic technology ( CDC and National Offi ce of Public Health Genomics, 2008 ). Ultimately, the role of diagnostics in clinical care must be balanced with other tools available to the physician, such as patient history and physical exam (Halkin et al., 1997 ) .

Will the clinical value of the test be clearly demonstrated to thought leaders, early adopters, patient advocacy groups, and other stakeholder; required for rapid uptake of the diagnostic? The role of professional society guidelines, CMS coverage, technology review by the insurance industry, and regulators must be considered.

Furthermore, the emphasis on HPAI rather than a broader One Health approach potentially misses an opportunity to embrace a wider notion of health including the role of wildlife, the integration of resources from various health and nonhealth authorities, as well as concrete plans for regular communication across health and related disciplines. ASEAN is in a unique position to be the premier institution in Asia coordinating, influencing, and even governing to some degree an integrated One Health approach for part of the Western Pacific Region. The HPAI roadmap is a step in the right direction but much remains to be done if ASEAN is to be a One Health leader. ASEAN's biggest challenge may be the reluctance of member nations to advise on what others should be doing. This is, however, a requirement for an integrated One Health network to be effective among the member states.",13.705133910168293,7.887800012346286

One of the main reasons was the incomplete definition of the proteome due to the lack of comprehensive genomic information, as well as technical limitations for large scale profiling of proteins. During the past few decades, improved and novel technologies have emerged as powerful tools for proteomic studies including shotgun proteomics by mass spectrometry technology [1] and protein microarray technology [2] . Mass spectrometry technology, combined with various sample preparation methods, has been used extensively in biological research such as proteome profiling [3] , protein-protein interaction mapping [4, 5] and identification of post-translational modification [6] [7] [8] . The greatest advantage of this technology lies in its capability of high throughput protein identification and quantification. Nevertheless, mass spectrometry still has its limitations, such as the undersampling issue (insufficient coverage of the proteome) [9, 10] as well as bias against low abundant proteins [11] . For the purpose of this review mass spectrometry technology will not be covered here in detail. Protein microarray technology, on the other hand, does not have the above limitations for mass spectrometry owing to its particular platform. Protein microarray technology [12, 13] was developed upon the completion of the genome sequence of multiple organisms, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [14] and humans (Homo sapiens) [15] . Determination of genomic sequences leads to the annotation of known and predicted open reading frames (ORFs) in these genomes, which makes it possible to express the full or partial proteome with large-scale cloning and gene expression methods [2] .",9.228188283427832,7.404947223777073

But the growing discrepancy between expectations and results in this field poses a crucial question that must be addressed: what can be learned from all of the new virusestheir sequences in particular-identified by new technologies such as next-generation sequencing? First, differences between viruses and viral sequences must be discussed and clarified. About 20 years ago, in the early days of PCR diagnostics, the phenomenon of reaction products 'hopping' between PCR tubes left virologists hesitant to accept the existence of new viruses until isolates were obtained and characterized. The advanced technology used nowadays allows us to find sequences that often form new phylogenetic clades clearly different from laboratory strains, so they are unlikely to be contamination artifacts. Although nextgeneration sequencing will also detect integrated defective viruses and viral genome fossils 27 , most of the encountered new sequences represent true viruses with the potential to replicate and cause disease in humans.",11.168015760081659,9.363799515032944

As is the case with other complex pathogens, it will be the consolidation of data from multiple sources each of which independently provides an incomplete picture, along with the application of new technology platforms, that will lead to vaccines and therapies for RSV. In addition, because RSV largely affects the very young and the old, success against RSV will require a commitment to better understanding immune responses to infection early and late in life. -JS",9.944938129148538,9.170631807135123

One approach is for each country to have a ""roadmap"" for its agricultural development, and these roadmaps might be aggregated into a regional roadmap. The US report: A Science Roadmap for Agriculture -cited as Task Force on Building a Science Roadmap for Agriculture, National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, Experiment Station Committee on Organisation and Policy, ""A Science Roadmap for the Future"", November 2001 (www.nasulgc.org/comm_food. htm) http://agsci.oregonstate.edu/files/main/roadmap2.pdf pioneered a way to define the needs of agriculture and help shape the future direction of the various strands of agriculturally relevant science. This impressive US-specific study followed a conceptual framework of needs to (a) be competitive in a global economy; (b) add value in future harvests; (c) adjust agriculture to a changing climate; (d) be good stewards of the natural environment and natural resources; (e) make agricultural enterprises profitable; (f) make families and communities strong; and (g) modify foods for improved health and safety. One important relevant outcome of this work is the obvious requirement to grow crops and practice livestock husbandry in the most appropriate environments, enabling different environmental zones to have a critical mass of expertise and facilities. For the water-constrained Arab Middle East, this would mean increased reliance on food imports that could also be regarded as a form of water importation. But this would be possible only if there were formal agreements between food-producing and food-recipient countries, and these agreements were economically and politically stress-resistant. To this caveat would be questions of how to pay for imports, and acquiring resources required to redirect the agricultural workforce into other wealth-creating activities. Introduction of a logical, science-led agricultural roadmap in the Region may be impossible at present but needs to be initiated. On a global level, food commodity and non-food agricultural commodities prices have declined by 17-18% in the period mid-September 2014 to mid-September 2015 (see The Economist Commodity-Price Index (2015) in www.Economist.com/indicators), reflecting relatively clement weather conditions in most of the producing areas, greater production efficiency, balance sheets strong enough to bear losses, competition to gain market share, and continuing investments. Importing countries, however, are affected by the strength of their currencies amongst other factors, such as social upheaval. Unlike other commodities whose prices direct reflect industrial demand, prices of foodstuffs reflect the effects of weather, pests and diseases, the demands of a rising global population, and many kinds cannot be readily stockpiled. A further factor operating at the global level is the domination of farm supplies by six international companies: Monsanto (the largest seed producer), Syngenta (the largest agrochemical producer), Bayer, BASF, Dow Chemical, and Du Pont). All of these companies have been active in acquiring other companies and patents, thus reducing competition, and potentially reducing innovation as they robustly defend their intellectual property. In this era of low commodity prices and developing resistance to older-type herbicides, farmers are constrained by input costs of fertilisers, seeds, agrochemicals and veterinary medicines that have steadily risen in over the past decade, only partially alleviated by the recent reduction in fuel and lubricant costs.",12.102216611875265,6.34759835372429

Scalable transcriptional analysis routine (STAR) represents a novel integration of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis that allows detection of dozens of gene transcripts in a multiplexed format using amplicon size as an identifier for each target. STAR demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and precision compared to two commonly used methods, SYBR Green-based and TaqMan probe-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. STAR can be used as a flexible platform for building a variety of applications to monitor gene expression, from single gene assays to assays analyzing the expression level of multiple genes. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus as a model system , STAR technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. Blinded studies using RNA extracted from various tissues of a SARSinfected individual showed that STAR correctly identified all samples containing SARS virus and yielded negative results for non-SARS control samples. Using alternate priming strategies , STAR technology can be adapted to transcriptional profiling studies without requiring a priori sequence information. Thus , STAR technology offers a flexible platform for development of highly multiplexed assays in gene expression analysis and molecular diagnostics. Nucleic acid testing of clinical samples and tissues is increasingly widespread and applied to various areas of medicine and diagnostics including pathogen identification, 1 blood bank testing, 2 cancer recurrence, 3 and prediction of clinical outcome. 4 The competitive landscape of available technologies is characterized by clear sep-aration of very sensitive and quantitative methods measuring single bioanalytes [real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), transcription mediated amplification, ligase chain reaction, rolling circle amplification, and so forth] and methods capable of multiplexing thousands of genes (DNA microarrays, serial analysis of gene expression, differential display, and so forth) with less sensitivity and quantitative ability compared to single gene methods. The recent introduction of technologies capable of analyzing a number of analytes or biomarkers in a highthroughput multiplex configuration in clinical diagnostics 5, 6 and gene expression analysis (HT Genomics, www.htgenomics.com) demonstrates a growing trend toward development of multiplex assays.

Real-time PCR is perfectly capable of generating results within a few minutes. However, the processes leading up to the analytical steps are often unwieldy and performed in batches within a high-complexity laboratory environment. Moreover, the requirement for complex procedures ties the availability of molecular diagnostic test results with the limited availability of highly trained personnel.

Dingemans°, R. Boesten, C. Klaassen, M. Reijans, J. Meis, T. Boekhout, G. Simons (Maastricht, Utrecht, Nijmegen, NL) Objective: Candida yeasts are the fourth most common source of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Especially during the last decade, the prevalence of opportunistic Candida infections has increased and has become a serious threat to high risk patients. To date, most molecular diagnostic tools are based on ribosomal regions. Although broadly applied, these target genes have difficulties discriminating closely related species, causing misidentification and underestimation of polymicrobial infections. This results in an urgent need of high discriminatory and accurate detection methods for clinical purposes using novel probes. The aim of this project is to improve molecular diagnostics of yeastrelated infections. Methods: A novel DNA based diagnostic system using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technology serves as our platform for molecular diagnostics using newly developed diagnostic probes. A Candida-MLPA assay containing probes for C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, and C. lusitaniae has been developed. Results: The specificity of the assay was validated on 50 Candida/non-Candida spp. from CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre. In addition, 95 clinical isolates were screened with the MLPA assay and the results were compared with AFLP profiles. In case of any discordance the identity of the strain was established by sequencing the ITS region. Furthermore, the total screening encompassed phylogenetically related species, including 31 Candida spp., 4 Pichia spp. and S. cerevisiae. The Candida-MLPA assay showed a 100% concordance with the ITS sequences. The analytical sensitivity of the Candida-MLPA assay was established on 100 fg gDNA, which represents less than two yeast cells. Conclusions: We demonstrated that an assay based upon the MLPA technology was able to identify 8 Candida spp. in one reaction. Multiple infections, up to 7 species in one sample, could be identified. Due to the nature of the MLPA technology highly complex assays are possible providing room for additional probes like a generic Candida probe or probes for other emerging species. The specificity and sensitivity of this multiparameter assay shows great potential for a fast and comprehensive screening approach for clinically relevant Candida spp. in a diagnostic setting.",11.000610164362048,8.853537875458844

Access to the DNA sequences of entire microbial genomes offers new opportunities to analyze and understand microorganism at the molecular level. Scientists are able to detect pathogens in biological tissues and study variations in gene expression in response to the pathogenic invasion. These responses help in designing novel approaches for microbial pathogen detection and drug development. Identification of certain microbial pathogens as etiologic agents responsible for chronic diseases is leading to new treatments and prevention strategies for these diseases. Each species of pathogens carries with it unique DNA or RNA signatures that differentiate it from other organisms. One of the challenges is to develop this DNA signature for each microorganism of interest for rapid and specific detection.

The organisms that are assigned to each peak are based on the collective interpretation from eight broad-range primers. applications and conclusions Infectious diseases are, by definition, communicable, and yet virtually all infections in individual patients are diagnosed and treated in isolation. What might be learned about the virulence of a microorganism or its response to selected therapies is not easily transferred to aid the treatment of patients who become sequentially infected with the same clonal strain. For example, two paediatricians who work in the same medical complex are likely to see children who have been infected by the same pathogen, but have no way of knowing it. The microorganism in question might be making its way across a country, having been treated successfully or unsuccessfully by other physicians weeks or months earlier in adjacent states, provinces or countries. The technology described here has the potential to integrate infectious disease identification and treatment across time and distance. As the Ibis T5000 provides digital signatures of identified microorganisms, this technology allows the collection and dissemination of epidemiological information in real time. The microbial signatures, along with previous treatment information on that pathogen, can be shared electronically. New signatures can be recorded in a central database and the appearance of those signatures in new locations will enable real-time epidemiological analysis by public-health officials. likewise, integration of biodefence surveillance with routine clinical diagnostics is facilitated by the use of technology that identifies any organism that infects patients, including bioterrorist agents, rather than only routinely observed infectious agents. We suggest that the infectious disease community should consider the impact of integrating the various communities of stakeholders who are concerned with infectious microorganisms.

One of the main reasons was the incomplete definition of the proteome due to the lack of comprehensive genomic information, as well as technical limitations for large scale profiling of proteins. During the past few decades, improved and novel technologies have emerged as powerful tools for proteomic studies including shotgun proteomics by mass spectrometry technology [1] and protein microarray technology [2] . Mass spectrometry technology, combined with various sample preparation methods, has been used extensively in biological research such as proteome profiling [3] , protein-protein interaction mapping [4, 5] and identification of post-translational modification [6] [7] [8] . The greatest advantage of this technology lies in its capability of high throughput protein identification and quantification. Nevertheless, mass spectrometry still has its limitations, such as the undersampling issue (insufficient coverage of the proteome) [9, 10] as well as bias against low abundant proteins [11] . For the purpose of this review mass spectrometry technology will not be covered here in detail. Protein microarray technology, on the other hand, does not have the above limitations for mass spectrometry owing to its particular platform. Protein microarray technology [12, 13] was developed upon the completion of the genome sequence of multiple organisms, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [14] and humans (Homo sapiens) [15] .

As MERS-CoV grows in global importance-causing disease and death in more than 1,700 and 600 people, respectively, across 27 countries 1 -research and development (R&D) efforts to design diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic products are gaining momentum. In the aftermath of the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the current Zika virus outbreak, it has become clear that more strategic investments are needed in the early development of diagnostics, therapeutics and preventives against pathogens of pandemic potential 2 . The ultimate goal is to reduce delays between the identification of a public-health emergency and the deployment of effective medical interventions that will save lives and minimize socioeconomic disruption. Toward this objective, the WHO is developing a blue-print for emergency R&D to prevent, or at least mitigate, the impact of infectiousdisease outbreaks. MERS-CoV is one of eight pathogens prioritized in the WHO blueprint (http://www.who.int/medicines/ e b o l a -t r e at m e nt / W H O -l i s t -o f -t o pemerging-diseases/en/), and it was selected as a case study to demonstrate how accelerated basic and applied research, as well as product development, could be better supported and coordinated. The WHO therefore convened a consultation of leading experts (Supplementary Note 1) on 10-11 December 2015 to develop a roadmap for MERS-CoV activities as part of the blueprint agenda.",8.834163861985369,6.294436249266443

Until the full potential of drug-resistant markers is understood, rapid molecular antimicrobial testing must still be combined with traditional microbial cultivation.",11.779024406050086,9.701263693293983

They may be used as hybridization probes in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screening and to detect biological markers for cancer, infection, and cardiovascular diseases [120, 121] . The precise handling of very small amounts, ranging in the nanoliter to picoliter scale, in microchannels [122] [123] [124] [125] , combined with sensitive detection methods like electrochemical microarrays [126] , predispose these technologies for point-of-care (POC) and lab-on-a-chip (LOC) diagnostics.

Compared to reference strain P. aeruginosa PAO1 (www.pseudomonas.com), which exhibits no resistance against therapy relevant anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, this P. aeruginosa strain harbors various genes or mutations assigned to antibiotic resistance. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in gyrA, parC, mexR, nalC, ampD, and ampR gene, respectively. Additionally, specific fluorescence signals above the cut-off indicated the presence of a vim-1, aac(6′)-Ib, aph(3′) and aadA1 gene (all positions are highlighted by colored frames). The observed phenotypical resistance was in complete accordance with the resistance determinants detected by DNA microarray genotyping. As indicated in the table, different resistance mechanisms rendering the same antibiotics as resistant (e.g. target alteration in gyrase and topoisomerase as well as efflux for fluoroquinolones, or chromosomal and plasmid encoded beta-lactamases as well as efflux for penicillins, cephalosporines, and carbapenems) were present at the same time, demonstrating the complex underlying genotype of phenotypically expressed resistance increase in reaction surface compared with a flat twodimensional surface, allows more targets to bind and enhances probe-target interaction. The ability to measure temperature variation and continuous monitoring of the reaction using fluorescence technology allows meltingcurve analysis instead of end-point detection [105] [106] [107] .

Very few portable systems have yet to be developed for mucus separation and sample extraction. One exciting example is the Cepheid GeneXpert technology that uses an automated cartridge for the ultrasonic lysis of organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis captured in a filter. This is followed by PCR-based detection of the pathogen and determination of rifampicin resistance [25, 47] . However the cost of the Cepheid Xpert instrument is not trivial, with a unit cost of at least $17,000 USD [48, 49] .

This of course is exciting, but also daunting, for researchers as they seek to advance the field. The ASSURED criteria will provide ongoing guidance to the development of relevant tools, but of course it is important to recognize that each design feature should be considered in the context of the intended POC environment. In other words, the intended application of an ideal diagnostic device must be considered from the outset of design. When cost is not the main limiting factor to deployment, ultrarapid, self-contained disposable cassettes may be ideal. However in well-established but poor urban environments, other factors such as time or convenience may be less of a constraint on design in favor of being able to provide clinical-grade results. There may even be a future for applications where even sensitivity or specificity can be sacrificed in favor of strategies in which multiplexed detection and low cost provide redundancy for diagnosis of complex disease (e.g., paper-based gene expression profiling; [158] ). The key is that without a final set of applications and target population in mind, the complete design space available to build practical portable diagnostics may not be recognized ( Fig. 6.1) . Similarly, as developers of POC diagnostics we must also be held to account on implementation, including a workflow from sample through to answer. Steps toward implementation must follow technology development; otherwise our efforts become only an academic exercise, which must not happen. Unfortunately, the literature is replete with reports of incremental advances that have not been demonstrated with real samples and/or under real-field conditions. While the reasons for this are complex, future leaders in the field, and those who will see their designs catch the attention of the funders, will be the ones who take the time (and risk) to push the limits of their technology and iterate until their design criteria are met.

For instance, only 9% of people with Viral Hepatitis have been diagnosed due to limited access to testing services.

The use of SiO 2 provides a different set of surface activation chemistries. The choice of SiO 2 /Si also benefits from mature semiconductor processing technology that may offer reduced cost and enables easy integration with electronics for potential lab-on-a-chip applications. It is also noted that SPR detection is generally performed real-time in solution, which can enable one to observe binding dynamics [19] . Whereas binding dynamics are important for a number of applications, there often remains great value in observing the endpoint alone, particularly when doing so provides improved test simplicity, cost effectiveness, or speed. Nearly the entire present day DNA and protein microarray market, including commercially available medical diagnostics, observe only the binding endpoint [1] - [4] , [21] . As well, many low-throughput protein-based medical diagnostics forgo observing binding dynamics [22] . In the present system, real time, in solution measurements, have been avoided along with the challenge they present to cavity stability. The value that the present technique offers over state-of-the-art label-free sensing is that the setup is simple, tests can be fast and cost effective, and the technique scales readily to very high throughput.

The net amount of MW produced in China was approximately 670,000 tonnes in 2006, with a daily average output of 1,780 tonnes. Medical waste carries various pathogens, which could cause environmental pollution to water, air and soil and spread disease to endanger human health. If it was mishandled, the release of dioxin, heavy metals and other pollutants from disposal process could case secondary pollution to damage ecological environment. Medical waste has been listed at Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal and also concerned by Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants(hereinafter refer as 'Convention') [1] [2] There are two major medical waste disposal technologies--incineration and non-incineration technologies. Incineration technology refers to the warm disposal technology and high-temperature thermal disposal technologies. Non-incineration technology refers to the low temperature heat treatment, chemical processing technology, radiation processing technology, biological treatment technologies, and etc [3] . Before the outburst of SARS in 2003, the medical waste in China was managed and disposed in a decentralized way within hospitals. Medical waste was only simply incinerated in incinerators without necessary air pollution control devices, or mixed with municipal solid wastes and then landfill, or illegally reused and recycled. Following SARS epidemic in 2003, Chinese Government moved quickly to establish the National Plan for Construction of Facilities for Disposal of Hazardous Waste and Medical Waste, in which China is committed to construct about 300 dedicated MW disposal facilities across the country. The national survey on hazardous waste and MW disposal facilities found that there are 149 dedicated MW treatment facilities at 2004, which mainly used incineration disposal technology and only 2 facilities was used non-incineration technology. However, the operation of most of incineration facilities was not very successful and it is very difficult to change this situation. With the country ratified Convention at 2004, more and more attention was paid to dioxin release from medical waste incineration. The non-incineration technology of medical waste disposal was rapid developed within the country. Up to the end of 2010, there are more than 200 medical waste disposal facilities approved, constructed and operated within National Plan for Construction of Facilities for Disposal of Hazardous. The applied technologies were included pyrolysis incineration, rotary kiln incineration, autoclave, chemistry disinfection, and microwave and its combination of technology.

The manipulation of viral RNA genomes is generally difficult due to the instability of RNA genomes and the lack of research tools for direct RNA editing. However, with RG technology, the modification of infectious RNA viruses can be easily achieved. In previous studies, RG technology has been applied to the genetic modification of genomes of positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses and to rescue mutant viruses from cDNA infectious clones (Taniguchi et al., 1978; Racaniello and Baltimore, 1981; Castrucci and Kawaoka, 1995) . RG technology has widespread implications in the fields of virology and vaccinology (Ito et al., 2001; Collins and Murphy, 2005; Almazan et al., 2013) . Using RG technology, a highly pathogenic strain of a virus can be attenuated by the construction of a chimeric virus with highly and weakly pathogenic viruses.

However, RG technology has been used mainly to characterize the function of viral proteins but has not been used to develop recombinant vaccine candidates against PRRSV. In this study, a chimeric virus was constructed using an infectious clone of PRRSV containing genomes of the FL12 strain and a Korean dominant field strain, LMY.

FIV infection does not release suf®cient levels of virus in circulation for conventional enzyme immunoassays (EIA) to detect viral antigens consistently. Sensitive PCRbased assays have been used to detect FIV infection in experimentally infected cats (Vahlenkamp et al., 1996; Klein et al., 1999 Klein et al., , 2001 Pedersen et al., 2001) . The sensitivity and speci®city of these assays should be compared to FIV antibody-based commercial assays prior to use due to the expense of these sensitive assays compared to conventional assays. The recent approval of a PCR-based assay for HIV-1 diagnostics sets the precedent for use of such assay systems as an additional test to the antibody-based assays (antibody-speci®c EIA assays and con®rmatory Western blot analysis) in current use (Bootman and Kitchin, 1994) . The impact to the current antibody-based FIV diagnostics will vary according to the type of FIV vaccine released for commercial use. The conventional inactivated FIV vaccine, for released this year, has a major con¯ict with current FIV diagnostics including the con®rmatory Western blot analysis (Fig. 1) . This vaccine, depending on the antigenic level of the commercial vaccine, induces broad spectrum antibody production to different FIV proteins with long-lasting titers. However, if appropriately inactivated, this vaccine will not result in viral antigen or genome production and will not con¯ict with PCR-based assays or conventional antigen-speci®c EIA assays. In contrast, live attenuated vaccines can cause signi®cant con¯ict with current commercial FIV diagnostics. Also, potential con¯icts may arise with future viral PCR-or protein-based diagnostics depending upon the level of attenuation. Since the current approach for testing attentuated FIV vaccines is based on viral regulatory gene deletion mutants, the attentuated virus will contain genes for viral structural proteins which are detectable by current FIV diagnostics. If improperly or insuf®ciently attenuated vaccines are used on immunocompromized hosts, the vaccine virus may escape the host compromized immune system and produce suf®cient vaccine virus in circulation to interfere with current as well as future diagnostics.",9.35460947971492,7.435274430685562

To achieve those goals, SCORE organized several symposia attended by European experts on antibiotic resistance, including microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, and pharmaceutical industry scientists. These meetings, a questionnaire on antibiotic resistance, a continuous flow of comments and suggestions via e-mail, publicly available reports and literature have been summarized in a widely supported and consensusbased report (Verhoef et al., 2004) .

Scalable transcriptional analysis routine (STAR) represents a novel integration of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis that allows detection of dozens of gene transcripts in a multiplexed format using amplicon size as an identifier for each target. STAR demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and precision compared to two commonly used methods, SYBR Green-based and TaqMan probe-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. STAR can be used as a flexible platform for building a variety of applications to monitor gene expression, from single gene assays to assays analyzing the expression level of multiple genes. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus as a model system, STAR technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. Blinded studies using RNA extracted from various tissues of a SARSinfected individual showed that STAR correctly identified all samples containing SARS virus and yielded negative results for non-SARS control samples. Using alternate priming strategies, STAR technology can be adapted to transcriptional profiling studies without requiring a priori sequence information. Thus, STAR technology offers a flexible platform for development of highly multiplexed assays in gene expression analysis and molecular diagnostics. Nucleic acid testing of clinical samples and tissues is increasingly widespread and applied to various areas of medicine and diagnostics including pathogen identification, 1 blood bank testing, 2 cancer recurrence, 3 and prediction of clinical outcome. 4 The competitive landscape of available technologies is characterized by clear sep-aration of very sensitive and quantitative methods measuring single bioanalytes [real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), transcription mediated amplification, ligase chain reaction, rolling circle amplification, and so forth] and methods capable of multiplexing thousands of genes (DNA microarrays, serial analysis of gene expression, differential display, and so forth) with less sensitivity and quantitative ability compared to single gene methods. The recent introduction of technologies capable of analyzing a number of analytes or biomarkers in a highthroughput multiplex configuration in clinical diagnostics 5, 6 and gene expression analysis (HT Genomics, www.htgenomics.com) demonstrates a growing trend toward development of multiplex assays.

Within the past decade, there has been a flurry of new research, development and patent applications around nanoscaled technologies in the health area . One of the principal areas of nanotechnology is ''nanomedicine,'' which, according to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Nanomedicine Roadmap Initiative, refers to highly specific medical intervention at the molecular scale for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases (NIH Roadmap Initiatives, http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/initiatives.asp.). Nanomedicine has significant potential for revolutionizing the diagnostics and therapeutics under the premise of developing smart nanodevices. The overall objective of nanomedicine is the same as it has been in medicine: to diagnose as accurately and early as possible, to treat as effectively as possible without side effects, and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment noninvasively (Caruthers et al., 2007) . Bioactive delivery nanosystems (nanocarriers) in general, and drug delivery in particular, constitute a significant domain of nanomedicine. Most drugs have been formulated for the oral or injection delivery routes, which are not always the most efficient routes for a particular therapy. New bioactive materials, such as nucleic acids and proteins, require novel delivery technologies that will minimize side effects and lead to better patient compliance (Hughes, 2005) .

The development of molecular beacons and other fluorescent probes (such as the TaqMan® probe that is produced by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) has made real-time monitoring of PCR amplification and quantification of nucleic acids in clinical specimens possible 21 . Beacons are hairpinshaped oligonucleotide probes that have a fluorophore that emits photons and is closely associated with a quencher, which absorbs the photons. In the presence of a complementary strand of DNA, the hairpin structure unfolds and fluorescence is emitted, and this can be measured to determine the amount of DNA that is present. Multiple targets can be monitored 22 using fluorophores with different emission spectra. This technology, which is highly sensitive, is commercially available as the TaqMan ® (Applied Biosystems; Perkin-Elmer Corp.) and LightCycler ® (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) systems. The advantages of real-time PCR are the rapidity of the assay (30-40 min), the ability to quantify and identify PCR products directly without the use of agarose gels, and the fact that contamination of the nucleic acids can be limited. Kits are available for the detection and quantification of DNA and RNA in clinical samples, and the technique has been specifically developed to enable the follow-up of patients with HIV and hepatitis C infections (Amplitech AME Bioscience; Bayer Diagnostics; Roche Diagnostics). Microscopy. Microscopy techniques have evolved with respect to three factors: the nature of the signal, the user-friendliness of the equipment, and the digitalization and computerized processing of the image. Electron microscopes -which were once complicated instruments that were only used in research -have been simplified and are now increasingly being used in clinical microbiology laboratories. They are useful for the rapid screening of routine clinical samples, such as stool samples, and also for detecting viruses in tissue cultures. With negative staining, a viral pathogen can be identified within 10 minutes of the arrival of a clinical or tissue-culture specimen in an electronmicroscopy laboratory 43 . Electron microscopy was used to rapidly identify Bacillus anthracis during the recent anthrax letters attack in the United States 43 and also to identify the genus (Coronavirus) of the SARS virus. The implementation of new technologies, such as automated pattern recognition 44 , remote operation of microscopes and telemicroscopy -which uses digital image acquisition and review of images through the internet 45 -will further increase the usefulness of electron microscopy.",8.580796830092844,8.870581212920191

These markers include ␣-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and prostate-specific antigen (58, 59 ) . Numerous aspects of the validation process need to be improved. The current high-output technologies used for the discovery of biomarkers are low-throughput methods (60, 61 ) . Therefore, novel technologies with a higher throughput and a higher analytical sensitivity are required; such technologies must also take into account the fact that only small quantities of sample are typically available, particularly in the case of clinical samples (61 ) . Protein microarrays have proved to be an excellent approach for biomarker-validation studies. Over the last few years, different automation concepts have been developed for protein arrays. One of the most advanced formats is the bead-based systems, for which different companies have developed automated systems (62 ) . In addition, planar protein microarrays have been adapted to the 96-well microtiter plate format, which allows microarrays to be processed with standard pipetting robots or multichannel pipettes (22, 57, 63 ) .

Limitations of these methods include complicated procedures that require extensive training (washings, centrifugations, and transfers), long completion times, expensive instrumentation, and technician-dependent result analysis. In addition, these technologies are not easily amenable to automation. Many hospitals and clinics currently send molecular diagnostics tests to large reference laboratories.

Total periodic approaches to develop technologies that enable us to solve mental health problems from basic original research to clinical or business applications, have not yet been performed [7,16]. In addition, there are insufficient independent R&D projects, medium- and long-term R&D promotion strategies, and roadmaps that can play a central/integrated role in national mental health R&D [27]. In Europe, mental health research is developed through a medium- and long-term roadmap which focuses on 6 major priority fields for mental health and wellbeing in Europe.

One of the firstly used RNAi technologies based on Ads was the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-specific targeting small RNAs. To induce and maintain the long-lasting silencing of VEGF, the study constructed E1A-mutated, E1B-deleted Ads with shVEGF expressing at the E3 region under the drive of U6 promoter. After the vaccination of the Ad-shVEGF in tumor-bearing mice, potent anti-angiogenesis was induced and resulted in tumor suppression and survival benefits.130 Recently, a study revealed that the amiRNAs based on the AdC68 vector could downregulate the survivin which was highly expressed in tumors, and the rAdC68 caused blockade of mitosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. In the tumor-xenograft nude mice models, survivin-targeting amiRNAs expressed by rAdC68 effectively delayed growth of hepatocellular and cervical carcinomas.131",5.278944819697502,8.035140652790732

They perceive two main approaches to dual use technology: the Anglo-American pragmatic approach and the continental metaphysical approach (Pustovit and Williams 2008). According to the authors these approaches are based on different understandings of technology: the Anglo-American approach “is associated with technology notion as a sequence of processes and operations aimed to products with necessary and useful for people properties. The second one with enough neutral definition-understanding of technology as use of organized knowledge for aiming at practical goals by systems of machines and people” (Pustovit and Williams 2008, p. 2). In their view the Anglo-American approach is directed at concrete technologies, the continental one also at the role and intentions of people. The authors illustrate the ‘American’ view by referring to the phrase “dual use research of concern” that has been developed in the—already mentioned—famous Fink-report of the National Research Council of the National Academies (2004), the starting point and analytical fundament of the present biosecurity debate in the United States, and not only there. Dual Use Research of Concern is defined as “research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied by others to pose a threat to public health and safety, agriculture, plants, animals, the environment, or material” (National Research Council of the National Academies 2004). The list of experiments of concern has now an almost official status. Experiments of concern are those that:Demonstrate how to render a vaccine ineffective;Confer resistance to therapeutically useful antibiotics or antiviral agents;Enhance the virulence of a pathogen or render a non-pathogen virulent;Increase the transmissibility of a pathogen;Alter the host range of a pathogen;Enable the invasion of diagnosis and/or detection by established methods;Enable the weaponization of a biological agent or toxin.",5.964163922191883,5.612744345289895

Furthermore Forge remarks that threats come and go. This means that a technology or an artefact that is labelled as dual use today does not have to be necessarily a dual use issue tomorrow. This is a very relevant remark, because it focuses attention on questions as: is there a threat?; what kind of a threat is it?; who determines if there is a threat?; is this threat serious enough to declare a technology or an artefact as dual use?; etc. Maybe the most important, but often neglected question is: when does a threat, and thus a dual use marking disappear and who is to decide this? Sometimes it seems that since the terrorist attacks and the anthrax letters of 2001 almost irreversible steps have been taken to counter a possible terrorist or—more specific—bioterrorist threat.

Such cooperation does not only take away possible misunderstandings, but it is also an appropriate remedy against possible tunnel visions, that could lead to an overemphasis of biosecurity.

In recent decades, several isothermal amplification methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) 7 , loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 8 , have been developed as attractive alternatives to conventional PCR method because of their simplicity, rapidity and low cost. However, there is still a challenge to apply it to develop a reliable POC diagnostics for clinical applications due to non-specific signals (e.g., false-positive). 9, 10 Recently, RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas nuclease-based nucleic acid detection has shown great promise for the development of next-generation molecular diagnostics technology due to its high sensitivity, specificity and reliability. 11, 12 For example, some Cas nucleases (e.g., Cas12a, Cas12b and Cas13a) perform strong collateral cleavage activities in which a crRNA-targetbinding activated Cas can indiscriminately cleave surrounding non-target single-stranded nucleic acids. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 By combining with RPA preamplification, Cas13 and Cas12a have, respectively, been used to develop SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) system 18 and DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) system 14 for highly sensitive nucleic acid detection. Apart from RPA method, some CRISPR-Cas-based nucleic acid sensors utilized the LAMP and PCR approaches, for instance, the CRISPR-Cas12b-assisted HOLMESv2 platform. 16 However, these CRISPR-Cas-based detection methods typically require separate nucleic acid pre-amplification and multiple manual operations, which undoubtedly complicates the procedures and brings about contaminations.",10.672329942070434,10.056888379543071

[6] [7] [8] Non-MS based methods, such as western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and protein arrays, rely on antibodies for the detection of proteins. Given recent studies concerning high variability in antibody production, LCMS-based methods are an attractive alternative approach for the rapid identification of small molecules, proteins, and peptides in clinical settings where consistency is paramount. 9, 10 In the 15 years since the 2003 SARS outbreak, LCMS technology has experienced a revolution led primarily by increases in the speed, sensitivity, and resolution of MS instruments. Today, protein array and antibody-based methods are falling out of favor in both research and clinical diagnostics, due in large part to the improvements in LCMS technology. 11, 12 A review of this growth by Grebe and Singh described a clinical lab with no LCMS systems in 1998 that completed over 2 million individual LCMS clinical assays in 2010. 13 Incremental improvements in rapid sample preparation techniques, chromatography, and data processing have also contributed to the increasing use of LCMS-based clinical testing. A 2013 study demonstrated the level of advance by identifying 4,000 yeast proteins in one hour of LCMS run time, identifying approximately 75 proteins/min at a rate 100 times faster than studies a decade prior. 14 LCMS methods can measure protein quantity by either the intact protein (protein-centric) or the analysis of proteolytic peptides (peptide-centric). While the mass to charge (m/z) ratio of a peptide or protein (MS1) may be a specific diagnostic in some materials, the majority of LCMS methods employ tandem MS in which the peptide or protein parent ion is subjected to gas phase collision to produce fragment ions. The measurement of the fragment ions (MS2) has a higher specificity and lower level of false positives and is the method of choice in clinical diagnostics. 12, 13 Protein-centric assays, such as intact parallel reaction monitoring or proteoform monitoring, performs well on small GTPases like KRAS, but larger proteins cannot currently be monitored with the same relative ease and accuracy. 15 For this reason, peptide-centric assays are currently the dominant proteomics approach.",7.679418707220966,6.714114751930262

We assessed the differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice in the health system in Malawi for the first time.,0.13608655946826081,2.353877544403076,2.2675046920776367,19cd718b-a7d2-4a27-8336-c7896965e5b8,biorxiv_medrxiv/Title: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) in Malawi: Implementation Gaps and Challenges for Timely Alert Submit journal: PLoS ONE,"We assessed the differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice in the health system in Malawi for the first time. According to the quantitative data, we observed relatively good completeness of IDSR monthly reports compared to timeliness. Timeliness is a general problem to countries implementing IDSR system across Africa, and this makes the public health authorities unable to take quick action and respond to the suspected health events [12, 25] . Facility level IDSR reports may not be sufficiently timely to pick up the outbreaks from community. The strengthened community level surveillance and verbal autopsy to detect unusual deaths can be a good approach to detect lower level health events and provide timely response [26] . In Malawi, a pilot study conducted in Lilongwe District in Central Region showed that mobile technologies had good opportunities to improve timeliness of HMIS reports [27] . However, concerning the different purposes of HMIS and IDSR system, a more integrated electronic IDSR system is essential for the health authorities to correspond the diverse demands. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/363713 doi: bioRxiv preprint African health ministries are quickly adopting mHealth solutions to improve disease surveillance and health programmes. Tanzania piloted an IDSR reporting system using SMS function and regular phones for report in 2011 [28] and further expanded it to be the national strategy for diseases surveillance using Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) technology linked with DHIS2 for the immediate reporting for IDSR [29] [30] [31] . Zambia tried to use DHIS2 mobile to enhance its malaria surveillance in Lusaka district and to improve case management and reporting [32] . Other mobile technologies including smartphone applications, patient monitoring devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), as well as laptops and tablets PCs connected with network service were piloted and implemented in various African countries [33] . Countries and development partners are eager to apply the mobile technology to capture real-time field data for surveillance and case management at the community level health care system [30, [34] [35] [36] [37] . However, notable issues were documented including technical, financial, infrastructural challenges, data security and medical supports during the design and implementation process of mHealth surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa countries [33] . Considering the complexity of public health works and needs of integration services at the community level [38] , the utilization of mobile technologies requires more rigorous studies to evaluate such innovations for programme implementation to become sustainable and scalable [39] .",3.0644689201141304,4.076462575752409

The PL intensity for electrophysiological recordings was routinely measured with a photodiode sensor (1 cm × 1 cm; PD300-1W, Ophir) placed over the recording chamber through a UV-cut filter fabricated from UV-cut goggles (SSUV 297, AS ONE) on each experimental day. In experiments using acute slices, the PL intensity over the slice in the recording chamber was measured. The intensity of unfiltered UV light over the recording chamber was <0.1 µW/cm 2 . The RL power of a Ce:GAGG crystal was measured with a fiber-coupled photoreceiver (Newport 2151) through an optical fibre (tip diameter: 200 µm) placed close to a Ce:GAGG crystal exposed to X-ray irradiation in an X-ray machine (MX-160Labo, mediXtec). The photoreceiver current, which was sampled using an analogue-digital converter (Picoscope 4262, Pico Technology), was calibrated against the PL power measured by the photodiode sensor and converted to luminescence intensity (in watts). PL emission spectra under UV illumination (340 ± 10 nm, LAX-103, Asahi Spectra) were measured using a spectrometer (QE-Pro, Ocean Optics). RL emission spectra under X-ray irradiation (70 kV, 1 mA) were measured through an optical fibre using a CCD spectrometer (DU-420-BU2, Andor) (12).",2.944410795663431,3.5022520821721574
