Specifically, the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is ""an effort by nations, international organizations, and civil society to accelerate progress toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats; to promote global health security as an international priority; and to spur progress towards reducing infectious diseases"" (1). Working with partner countries around the world, the GHSA will be focused on mitigating the impact of naturally occurring outbreaks and intentional or accidental releases of dangerous pathogens; assisting countries to rapidly detect and transparently report outbreaks when they occur; and employing Cooperative engagements and collaborations across borders help foster open communication and sharing of data. Being aware of the transboundary nature of pathogens helps break down the barriers to sharing information between countries, and cooperative engagement programs are designed to build a foundation of trust that can help lessen potential negative aspects of sharing data such as economic or political consequences. The fight against infectious diseases is shared by humanity; reducing individual infections and outbreaks of zoonotic diseases in humans, agricultural animals, and wildlife is a shared goal across the world. Fair et al. present a model for measuring the return on relationships of collaborations and the resulting networks of people that remain in place after trainings or projects are complete.",35.01013304519164,15.037147718713953

To date DLSP, across its three participating laboratories, is capable of testing for 153 different pathogens by rRT-PCR, serological assays, microscopy, bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence and TAC. (Fig. 2) . DLSP has been a leader in the development, validation and field evaluation of TAC technology capable of detecting > 25 pathogens from a single specimen from cases of common syndromes AFI, respiratory disease, enteric disease, encephalitis). TAC is a microfluidic PCR array platform that allows the customization of pathogen targets according to the needs of each study. Four main TACs were developed, evaluated and/or validated by DLSP (AFI, Enteric, Encephalitic and Respiratory). The AFI TAC has been validated in Kenya and other GDD centers and used throughout the GDD network of laboratories [30] . This TAC targets 25 pathogens (14 viral, 8 bacterial and 3 protozoa) with an overall sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 99% compared to conventional RT-PCR [30] . The Enteric TAC was similarly validated for 15 of the most common enteropathogens detected in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) using 1500 clinical specimens [31, 32] . The Encephalitis TAC was developed to detect 21 pathogens (2 parasites, 6 bacteria, 13 viruses) known to cause encephalitis, with an overall sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 97% across tested comparative assays [33] . Because TAC is an effective screening tool for multiple pathogens in a single sample, it can detect co-infections or discover emerging pathogens not routinely tested through national surveillance platforms that frequently have a narrow focus. As part of the DLSP collaboration, DGHP has recently acquired next generation sequencing (NGS) technology in KEMRI laboratories. NGS technology has expanded beyond the 1970s Sanger technology and 1988 capillary electrophoresis based sequencing instruments allowing for high throughput to produce 1.8 terabases in a single run which is approximately 1000-fold increase from the first generation sequencing technology. NGS is also capable of identifying new and multiple pathogens from single specimens [34] as well as further characterizing existing pathogens for phylogenetic analysis using metagenomics to detect microbiomes from different specimens (e.g., stool, blood, skin) [35] . The main advantage of whole genome (WG)-NGS is that there is no need to design primers by pathogen target and the laborious process of testing primers for specificity and assessment of their interference with other targets and will likely replace PCR technology as routine diagnostic test. WG-NGS has successfully identified a new rickettsial species, Candidatus Rickettsia asembonensis strain NMRCiiT [36] . Sequencing studies for use in characterizing the spread of influenza viruses, cholera, and vector-borne pathogens such as chikungunya, dengue and Zika viruses are in progress. Overall DLSP has participated in over 50 research projects in Kenya and scientists within DLSP were co-authors of over 180 peer-reviewed published articles.",26.021472342799786,12.118511262334128

Substantial autochthonous circulation in Italy, Iran and South Korea has been reported by now, while there is increasing evidence that subclinical infections occur and people may be infectious before symptoms appear [8] [9] [10] . These developments indicate that the window of opportunity to contain and eradicate is rapidly narrowing. [11] . Therefore, it is needless to state that for each phase in the control and mitigation of a novel emerging pathogen, adequate laboratory preparedness and response are crucial. The readiness survey that we performed served the important purpose of mapping the initial response capacities in Europe and identifying barriers to diagnostic implementation. Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens.

As NHP and particularly great apes are our closest relatives, protein sequence homologies are very high between great apes and humans and it seems reasonable to hypothesize that their pathogens are more likely to jump and easily adapt to humans (e.g., find an appropriate cellular receptor). Therefore, it is not surprising that NHP share many diseases with humans (72) .

With ectodomains of only ,20-40 residues, it is unclear how such diminutive viral fusion proteins mediate the initial stages (i.e. membrane contact and close membrane apposition) of the fusion reaction that precede actual membrane merger. We now show that the FAST proteins lack specific receptor-binding activity, and in their natural biological context of promoting cell-cell fusion, rely on cadherins to promote close membrane apposition. The FAST proteins, however, are not specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane apposition as indicated by their ability to efficiently utilize other adhesins in the fusion reaction. Results further indicate that surrogate adhesion proteins that bridge membranes as close as 13 nm apart enhance FAST protein-induced cell-cell fusion, but active actin remodelling is required for maximal fusion activity. The FAST proteins are the first example of membrane fusion proteins that have specifically evolved to function as opportunistic fusogens, designed to exploit and convert naturally occurring adhesion sites into fusion sites. The capacity of surrogate, non-cognate adhesins and active actin remodelling to enhance the cell-cell fusion activity of the FAST proteins are features perfectly suited to the structural and functional evolution of these fusogens as the minimal fusion component of a virus-encoded cellular fusion machine.

The technology can randomly amplify and detect all the pathogens that may be present in a sample, enabling universal unbiased pathogen detection. Unfortunately, this random amplification results in the amplification of all the nucleic acids, including host nucleic acids, which are more abundant than the pathogen nucleic acids. Therefore, millions of reads need to be analyzed to identify the pathogen(s) of interest. This drawback is one of the major hurdles that has delayed the implementation of the technology in the diagnostic laboratory because of the number of reagents that have to be used for deep sequencing and the need for curated databases to accurately evaluate such large data sets (8, 9) . An alternative to metagenomic sequencing is targeted NGS. Targeted NGS refers to the selective capture or amplification of specific genomic regions of interest prior to massive parallel sequencing. Compared to metagenomic sequencing, the possibility of targeted sequencing discovering new pathogens is limited. However, selectively sequencing pathogens of interest provides better sensitivity, better specificity, ease of downstream analysis, and lower cost by allowing more samples to be tested in one run (10) .

To determine whether a naturally occurring product is an inhibitor of dihydropyrimidinase, the inhibitory capabilities of the flavonols myricetin (with three hydroxyl substituents on the aromatic ring), quercetin (with two hydroxyl substituents on the aromatic ring), kaempferol (with one hydroxyl substituent on the aromatic ring), and galangin (without hydroxyl substituent on the aromatic ring) were tested. Furthermore, to study the structure-inhibition relationship with dihydropyrimidinase, the derivatives of myricetin, namely, dihydromyricetin (the ring does not contain a double bond but has additional two hydrogen atoms) and myricitrin (the ring is fused to an additional sugar block), were further used and tested (Fig 3A) .

While it has the advantage of being useful for single plasma units, its ineffectiveness against intracellular pathogens and probable interaction with coagulation factors considerably reduce its efficacy [124] . The SD approach acts by disrupting the envelope proteins of targeted pathogens, thus compromising the integrity of the pathogen and rendering it noninfectious. This approach is used on small pools of plasma. The limitation of this technique is that it is not active against non-enveloped pathogens, and that levels of coagulation factors such as protein S may be decreased significantly by some of the SD treatment methods [125, 126] .",23.50912328541736,10.811944250197818

The MERS-CoV RBD is highly conserved with very few mutations. By analysing the known RBD sequences, we found that the epitope of m336 does not overlap with any of the point mutations (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). By using genetic and structural analyses, we discovered that a germline-encoded antibody, m336, could achieve high-affinity recognition and neutralization of the newly emerged MERS-CoV, mostly by using allele-specific residues, as well as junctional amino acids. It is noteworthy that even though germline sequences of specific antibodies (for example, HIV-1 bnAbs) can be predicted by reconstructing B cell clonal lineages 39 , it may not be possible to infer the exact naturally occurring junctional amino acids, which were introduced by V(D)J rearrangement, a critical process preceding somatic hypermutation. Therefore, the junctional amino acids of the mature antibodies are usually retained or bioinformatically derived in the design of germline-encoded precursor antibodies [5] [6] [7] 40 . Notably, it has been demonstrated that adaptability of somatic mutations might depend on the nature of junctional amino acids that occur far ahead of any somatic mutations and could determine the maturation pathway of antibodies 36 . This finding, coupled with the fact that the matured antibodies for some viruses, for example, HIV-1, are highly somatically mutated, suggests that the junctional residues in matured antibodies may be quite different from their initial germline counterparts, a phenomenon that could have important consequences for the elicitation of bnAbs. Therefore, we propose here that alternative strategies to identify naturally occurring germline predecessors of bnAbs should be explored through human antibodyome rather than theoretically reconstructing them, thereby confounding the rational design of otherwise effective vaccine immunogens.",19.854165422743247,10.634355975924919

However, NGS analysis of mixed samples has the limitation to assign viral candidates to each isolate after BLASTN searches of quality contigs. Hence, NGSidentified viruses were confirmed and assigned to each isolate by using PCR/ELISA. All but 2 isolates (TW-01662-2010 and TW-02547-2011) were validated. An iterative mapping procedure was further performed for these two isolates that were not identified using PCR/ELISA to reveal viral genomes for detecting unknown pathogens. Although the read depths of these 2 genomes were lower than those of viral genomes from the other NGS data set, this iterative mapping process could be useful to detect unknown pathogens in clinical samples with a low viral load (or low CPE) in clinical samples. In addition, viral culturing with a low viral load negatively affects NGS experiments.

Major changes in animal production over the years, such as housing conditions and the increase in the production of food of animal origin, have induced animals to respond to these demanding circumstances with a range of non-specific responses of the body, defined as stress responses (Blokhuis et al., 1998) . Stress in dairy cows is associated with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases such as mastitis, Johne's disease, salmonellosis and bovine respiratory complex, as well as other production diseases including those affecting fertility, uterine diseases (metritis, retained placenta, prolapsed uterus), ketosis and milk fever, especially during the periparturient period (Nir, 2003) . Most proteomic investigations of bovine mastitis, using strategies including 2DE followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF)/MS and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), have been performed on bovine milk because of the relative ease of sample collection (Boehmer, 2011). These techniques have been used to evaluate the modification of milk proteins during mastitis in cows with naturally occurring infection (Hogarth et al., 2004; Smolenski et al., 2007) as well as in experimentally induced coliform mastitis (Boehmer et al., 2008; Boehmer et al., 2010a; Boehmer et al., 2010b; Danielsen et al., 2010) . Hogarth et al. (2004) found significant increases in serum albumin and transferrin, concurrently with marked decreases in caseins, β-lactoglobulin and α-lactoglobulin, in the whey from cows with mastitis, suggesting that the transport of serum proteins into milk was because of the failure of the blood-milk barrier. Smolenski et al. (2007) identified apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), cathelicidin-I, heat shock 70kD protein and the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) in milk fractions from cows with naturally occurring mastitis, indicating a local host response to infection in the mammary gland. Another acute-phase protein (APP), α-1-acid-glycoprotein, was identified for the first time by Boehmer et al. (2008) in normal and mastitis whey samples during a proteomic analysis investigating cows experimentally inoculated with E. coli. In a recent study, the serum proteome profile in cows with naturally occurring subclinical and clinical mastitis was investigated with three different yet complementary approaches in order to identify differentially expressed protein markers that are useful for early recognition of subclinical mastitis . Results demonstrated differential protein expression in the serum of cows with both subclinical and clinical mastitis.

On one hand, placing great restrictions on the accessibility to a number of agents and toxins does increase security by making them more difficult to obtain, with the caveat that these are naturally occurring agents that could be obtained from nature by a determined actor. On the other hand, there is the concern that focusing on lists and a relatively short list of agents means that the overwhelming majority of microbial threats are not on the DURC radar screen. For example, Zika virus emerged as a pathogen of pandemic potential with little or no anticipation from experts. Hence, making lists and focusing attention on those agents in the list has the paradoxical potential to reduce biosecurity since regulations are tightened for listed agents, possibly hindering research, while other dangerous agents are neglected (Casadevall and Relman, 2010) . A similar argument applies to the current DURC oversight policy of the U.S. government, which is focused on a specific list of agents. 2 This process, which is akin to searching under the lamppost, carries great danger because it ignores what could be significant threats. In this regard, it is noteworthy that fungal pathogens are seldom considered as biological threats despite the fact that members of this kingdom have significant weapon potential (Casadevall and Pirofski, 2006; Casadevall, 2017) .",21.159602763002628,10.620821548115144

The borderless world has many severe consequences, including the fact that it's very hard to prevent or contain pandemics. Perhaps the greatest failure of the GBD report is its ignorance of the evolutionary capacity of pathogens to adapt. Pathogens are not static; they exhibit rapid evolution in response to environmental conditions. As Price-Smith has argued, pathogens are constantly evolving to exploit novel ecological conditions that arise from new ecosystems, and many of these pathogens have arisen under conditions of relative prosperity. As such, these ""plagues of affluence"" now afflict people throughout the developed world, radiating throughout the new sanitized environments of technologically sophisticated ecosystems including hospitals and office environments [23] . Examples of pathogens that thrive in these new sanitary ecologies are Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), etc. Thus, the GBD study, which held that infectious diseases would simply be eradicated, did not account for the genetic mutability of pathogens; their ability to colonize novel ecological niches within sanitized societies; or how much they impact health and healthcare cost.",21.7032927407896,9.579059617412728

Substantial autochthonous circulation in Italy, Iran and South Korea has been reported by now, while there is increasing evidence that subclinical infections occur and people may be infectious before symptoms appear [8] [9] [10] . These developments indicate that the window of opportunity to contain and eradicate is rapidly narrowing. [11] . Therefore, it is needless to state that for each phase in the control and mitigation of a novel emerging pathogen, adequate laboratory preparedness and response are crucial. The readiness survey that we performed served the important purpose of mapping the initial response capacities in Europe and identifying barriers to diagnostic implementation. Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens. Furthermore, it clearly shows that diagnosis of respiratory viruses cannot be done syndrome-based and supports the need for the availability of diagnostics for a panel of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.",20.722295756496376,9.483574367935542

Second, our study had few reflected unmeasurable variables, such as the genotype of adenovirus, so the difference in the severity of illness between the Adv and Non-Adv groups may have led to the difference in the characteristics of fever and its response to antipyretics. Third, we conducted our study in a military hospital, so our cohort was not representative of the general population, since the military environment has different characteristics, such as living environment, nutrition/immune status, and mode of pathogen spread. Fourth, there was selection bias in that all patients admitted with CAP could not have respiratory PCR tests performed; the examination was limited to an upper respiratory tract, and Adv serotype or viral burden analyses were not performed.

In this study, we compared the characteristics of fever in Adv and Non-Adv group patients. The Adv group patients had a longer duration of fever and a higher proportion of peak body temperature than patients infected with other various viral respiratory pathogens or unknown pathogens. Similarly, Ho et al [22] observed that viral mono-pathogen patients had a higher mean body temperature than bacterial mono-pathogen patients. In addition, dualpathogen patients, such as S. pneumoniae with either influenza A or B, had a higher mean body temperature, although not significantly different from the respective mono-pathogens. However, there is still a lack of detailed data on the specific pathogen-related clinical characteristics, especially fever, in immunocompetent patients. Thus, our data is more likely to aid physicians in determining further diagnostic or therapeutic considerations at the time of admission. We also evaluated the response to antipyretic treatment between the Adv and Non-Adv groups. Our data showed that the Adv group patients exhibited a higher proportion of individuals with no response to antipyretic treatment compared with the Non-Adv or unknown pathogen group patients. Weisse et al. [23] evaluated the effect of acetaminophen on fever in bacterial vs. viral infections in 100 children. They concluded that there is no correlation between a fever response to acetaminophen and the etiology of the fever, revealing no usefulness in the response to antipyretic treatment in predicting etiologies of pneumonia. However, our data suggest that there may be a difference in the antipyretic response to Adv compared to other etiologies, and this is the first such data reported for immunocompetent adults.",21.00846412490005,8.927794030791205

Additionally, disease containment is much more difficult to achieve for aerosolized viral pathogens than for pathogens that spread solely via direct person-to-person contact.

The use of other methods to identify homology when the NCBI nt database does not have adequate representation available will be the second major area of improvement for the analytical pipelines used in this study. Further investigation of sample 1164 revealed that, by using the discontiguous megablast searching Most pathogens identified to date have had some sequence homology to previously identified pathogens, so it is very possible that etiological agents are being missed due to the lack of homology to existing known sequences [35] . Further, pathogen detection accuracy is important as environmental or sample contamination can lead to false pathogen discovery [36] . With increasing biosurveillance efforts in human and non-human populations, there will be large amounts of data generated that potentially contain novel pathogens with little or no homology to existing viruses [37, 38] . Less stringent nucleotide alignment approaches and BLASTx (translated nucleotide sequence to amino acid sequence) have the potential to detect some of these less homologous pathogens. However, many of these algorithms, such as BLASTx, are too computationally intensive to implement without heuristics or substantial dedicated computational resources. As more efficient algorithms are developed, such as the newly described DIAMOND [39] , they can be integrated into the existing analytical pipelines as well as pipelines developed elsewhere and hosted on Pathosphere.

While earlier studies have demonstrated the utility of this technology for detection of novel pathogens in human clinical samples, the capacity and practicality of TGC-NGS in a veterinary diagnostic setting have not yet been evaluated. Here we report the use of TGC-NGS assays for the detection and characterization of diverse feline pathogen taxa. We detected 31 pathogens comprising nine pathogen taxa in 28 felid samples analyzed. This included 20 pathogens detected via traditional PCR and 11 additional pathogens that had not been previously detected in the same samples. Most of the pathogens detected were sequenced at sufficient breadth and depth to confidently classify them at the species or subspecies level. Target nucleic acids were enriched from a low of 58-fold to 56 million-fold relative to host nucleic acids. Despite the promising performance of these assays, a number of pathogens detected by conventional PCR or serology were not isolated by TGC-NGS, suggesting that further validation is required before this technology can be used in lieu of quality-controlled standard assays.

We have shown that TGC-NGS assays can function as broad multiplex pathogen detection assays for animal pathogens.

A significant number of pathogens were identified that were not readily detected using more traditional veterinary diagnostic technologies, and we documented that bioinformatics analysis alone was not sufficient to detect pathogens from unenriched samples. We identified the limitations of this technology related to very low starting pathogen concentrations and poor sample quality.

Although the frequency of naturally occurring HCV NS5A and NS5B RASs has been addressed in many countries, there are only a few reports on their prevalence in the South American region. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RASs to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors in a DAA treatment naïve cohort of Uruguayan patients infected with chronic hepatitis C and compare them with reports from other South American countries. Here, we found that naturally occurring substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors were present in 8% and 19.2%, respectively, of treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected patients.

The neutralization assays showed that 7D10-H showed effective neutralizing activity against almost all pseudotyped MERS-CoV variants. Only the two mutations V26F and V26A on the NTD increased the IC 50 value of 7D10-H by more than 150-fold and significantly reduced its neutralization activity (Fig. 3a, b) , which confirmed the results of the structural and biochemical studies of the binding interface. All other naturally occurring mutations, most of them on the RBD and the S2 subunit did not affect the neutralization capability of 7D10-H (Fig. 3a, b) , indicating that 7D10 would have a wide neutralization breadth against different variants of MERS-CoV.",24.54413135860937,8.856447098703205

It is an excellent receptor for studying lipid-receptor interaction. Several different approaches to reconstituting the glycolipid receptor G M1 in model membranes have enabled the measurement of binding of its interaction partner cholera toxin. In liposomes and supported lipid bilayer systems, the ganglioside G M1 is free to diffuse across long distances and exhibits a non-uniform lateral distribution, i.e., self-aggregation, even at low incorporation ratios. Therefore the binding activity of ganglioside G M1 with cholera toxin B is restricted [71] . Investigations of ganglioside G M1 incorporated into nanodiscs found reduced protein aggregation. Bricarello et al. [72] found that the reconstitution of a low concentration of ganglioside G M1 in nanodiscs, shows binding of cholera toxin with a significantly higher affinity than in liposomes or supported lipid bilayers. This is due to the interaction of ganglioside G M1 with the headgroup region of the disc which reduces the oligomerization, thereby causing a potential effect on the affinity of toxin binding. Thus, nanodisc technology restricts the ganglioside G M1 oligomerization by controlling the number of ganglioside G M1 monomer isolated by each nanodisc.",17.44220427659272,9.601264502560015

As shown in Figure S1 , a significant bias was found and its pattern was identical in all samples. TG (CA)-rich regions were selectively amplified with the WTA kit (Table S3) , probably due to nucleotide sequences of the quasi-random primer. Random RT-PCR amplification using the WTA kit was at least one log higher than that using the conventional random hexamer (data not shown). This suggests that further improvement is required for whole viral genome analysis, although our system is suitable for the comprehensive detection of viral genes. In addition, the TG (CA)rich bias was observed within the viral genome; therefore, it seems unlikely that the bias leads to quantitative differences of the detected sequences with respect to the original population.

Biological weapons may be toxins or living pathogens. They may target humans, livestock, or crops and, hence, be aimed at mass murder or economic impact. Pathogens may be lethal or nonlethal, contagious or noncontagious, and they may infect the host via contact with openings in the skin, animal or insect vectors, ingestion of contaminated food or water, or inhalation, giving rise to a wide range of delivery mechanisms and attack outcomes that vary by many orders of magnitude in terms of their consequences. The current threat largely involves naturally occurring pathogens and toxins. In many ways, biological attacks are similar to the scourge of disease that has wrought havoc on human, animal, and plant populations for millennia, the main difference being that the consequences are greatly compressed in time if not scope. In the future, genetically altered or synthetic pathogens may be possible because the science of genetic manipulation and DNA synthesis is evolving rapidly.

The question presents itself: Why do we, as a society, worry more about the possibility of a synthetic designer pathogen, when some of the worst pathogens known to mankind are still raging? Measles virus, as a case in point, is one of the most contagious viruses to humans. As recently as in 2000, approximately 777,000 people died per year from measles, and in third-world countries with poor health care systems the fatality rate can be as high as 28% (Perry and Halsey, 2004) .

Additionally, only a few critical mutations in the H5N1 bird flu virus separate us from a virus that can easily spread among humans and lead to an influenza pandemic. The AIDS pandemic, caused by primate viruses that jumped the species barrier to humans, claims approximately 2 million lives annually (http://www.avert.org/worldstats.htm).

Classical PCR reaction, developed in the year 1983 is still in widespread use and, despite many changes and modifications, it is based on the same methodological foundations [46] . It seems obvious, also for many international experts [11, 47] , that the main direction in a near future diagnostic will be associated with any whole genome sequencing methods, but it is really hard to foresee on which technology, because of the speed of technology development. Sanger sequencing method, developed in the year 1977 is also still in use [48] , but nowadays it is widely supplanted by newer, Next Generation Sequencing methods. However, currently the life span of these modern methods is much shorter. For example pyrosequencing based sequencing technology was considered modern a few years ago [49] . Now it is widely replaced by more popular Illumina technology [50] . But even Illumina can also be easily supplanted by newer techniques, for example those that are able to produce much longer reads. And that is why more and more laboratories are implementing e.g. more modern PacBio technology [51] . That is also the problem with prediction, whether Nanopore sequencing technology [52] , that can be considered as a real revolution in the field of nucleic acids sequencing, will constitute a basic diagnostic technique in the future. Maybe the existing problems with the throughput (maybe solved by introducing of bigger equipment like PromethION), quite high error rate (but lower in each new generation of the flow cell and chemistry) or lack of easily accessible and ""microbiologist friendly"" software will make the technology soon replaced by another one. Nevertheless, nowadays such WGS analysis looks like the best choice for rapid diagnostics of highly dangerous pathogens.

These proteins are naturally occurring in most eukaryotes, and may play a role in nuclear transport, signal transduction, and innate immune responses, but no exact function has been established [164] . Each vault is a 70 nm organelle-like structure that is composed of three proteins: the major vault protein (MVP) makes up 70% of the complex, telomerase associated protein-1, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and non-coding RNAs [165] . Vaults can be designed to express heterologous proteins inside their central cavity. This is easily done by adding a specific sequence to the protein that has been determined to associate the PARP protein with MVP [165] . Vaults are not immunogenic themselves and do not lead to the development of autoimmune responses making them a good vaccine delivery system [165, 166] . Using the model protein ovalbumin, vaults were successful at inducing T C and T H responses in vaccinated animals. They were less successful at inducing humoral immune responses [167] . Vaults have been developed as vaccine candidates for Chlamydia muridarium infections. Inoculation induced both T H and T C responses leading to protection against challenge [168] . Despite the success with vaults their biggest weakness is that the antigen is contained within the vault cavity, which prevents it from stimulating B cells leading to strong humoral responses. Currently, vaults could function as strong vaccine candidates for intracellular pathogens, or for diseases such as cancer, but further development is needed for their use against a wide range of pathogens.",25.1335741085069,10.930583386698347

The process of monitoring chief complaints or presenting symptoms is referred to as syndromic surveillance. Electronic patient information 1 and databases 2 can aid researchers in the use of syndromic surveillance by providing an additional method for detecting clinical features of illness prior to confirmed diagnosis. 3 Active monitoring of community health may provide early warnings of disease outbreaks resulting from bioterrorism or natural phenomena. 4 The current use of automated record-keeping systems may help to identify potential clusters of acute illnesses, track those illnesses, and detect trends for future analysis. 5 In light of advanced technological tools and methodologies, local emergency management personnel and hospital-based health care providers are re-evaluating current surveillance systems and response capabilities.

First, clinical testing was done at the discretion of the treating clinician. Thus, some patients may not have had testing ordered or had a residual specimen for testing at MDH, leading to an underestimation of cases. A second caveat is that children, particularly those aged <1 year, are more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory infections and therefore have respiratory specimens obtained for testing [36] . This is reflected in the fact that 57% of patients from the SARI surveillance program were aged <5 years. Third, no information was obtained about underlying medical conditions or follow-up data for outpatient cases, and thus, a comparative analysis of comorbidities and outcomes with SARI cases was not possible. Finally, influenza C virus was commonly codetected with other viral pathogens. When compared to culture-based methods, molecular detection methods such as ours frequently detect multiple infections, which poses a challenge to interpretation [37] . Viral nucleic acid may be detectable for prolonged periods of time, including in asymptomatic individuals, and it can be difficult to distinguish among symptomatic infection, asymptomatic shedding, and noninfectious viral debris [37] . Therefore, it will also be important to measure influenza C virus prevalence in asymptomatic controls to address the potential for asymptomatic shedding. Nevertheless, by conducting surveillance in a large population and by incorporating multiplexed testing for other known pathogens, we identified 24 cases with influenza C virus but no copathogens detected. This included 2 cases who became ill enough to warrant ICU admission.

In the 1980s and 1990s, biotechnology techniques produced novel therapeutics and a wealth of information about the mechanisms of various diseases such as cancer at the genetic and molecular level, yet the etiologies of other complex diseases such as obesity and heart disease remained poorly understood. Recently, however, researchers utilizing exciting and groundbreaking ""omic"" technologies and working closely with clinicians have begun to make serious progress not only toward a molecular-level understanding of the etiology of complex diseases but to clearly identify that there are actually many genetically different diseases called by the single name of cancer, diabetes, depression, etc. Later in this chapter, we will explore the concepts of phenotype. Important here is that most human diseases are manifested through very complex phenotypes that result from genetic, environmental, and other factors. In a large part, the answers were hidden in what was unknown about the human genome. Despite the increasing knowledge of DNA structure and function in the 1990s, the genome, the entire collection of genes and all other functional and nonfunctional DNA sequences in the nucleus of an organism, had yet to be sequenced. DNA may well be the largest, naturally occurring molecule known. Successfully meeting the challenge of sequencing the entire human genome is one of history's great scientifi c achievements and heralds enormous potential (Venter et al. 2001 ; International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium 2001 ) . While the genetic code for transcription and translation has been known for years, sequencing the human genome provides a blueprint for all human proteins and the sequences of all regulatory elements that govern the developmental interpretation of the genome. The potential signifi cance includes identifying genetic determinants of common and rare diseases, providing a methodology for their diagnosis, suggesting interesting new molecular sites for intervention (see Fig. 8 .1 ), and the development of new biotechnologies to bring about their eradication.

Neonatal isoerythrolysis (NI) is a form of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in which colostrumderived maternal antibodies react against the newborn's erythrocytes. It is common in horses ( Fig. 13-30 ) and has been reported in cattle, cats, and some other domestic and wildlife species. In horses, neonatal isoerythrolysis occurs as a result of immunosensitization of the dam from exposure to an incompatible blood type inherited from the stallion (e.g., transplacental exposure to fetal blood during pregnancy or mixing of maternal and fetal blood during parturition). A previously mismatched blood transfusion produces the same results. Some equine blood groups are more antigenic than others; in particular, types Aa and Qa are very immunogenic in mares. In cattle, neonatal isoerythrolysis has been caused by vaccination with whole blood products or products containing erythrocyte membrane fragments. Neonatal isoerythrolysis has been produced experimentally in dogs, but there are no reports of naturally occurring disease. In cats the recognized form of neonatal isoerythrolysis does not depend on prior maternal immunosensitization but on naturally occurring anti-A antibodies in queens with type B blood.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables unbiased detection of all potential pathogens. To apply mNGS in viral diagnostics, sensitive and simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses is needed. Herein, were studied the performance of an in-house mNGS protocol for routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections with potential for automated pan-pathogen detection. The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis were designed and optimized, including exogenous internal controls. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using 25 clinical respiratory samples. The developed protocol using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing showed high repeatability. Use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information's RefSeq database as opposed to the National Center for Biotechnology Information's nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of classification of viral pathogens. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value. Sensitivity of mNGS, compared with PCR, varied up to 83%, with specificity of 94%, dependent on the cutoff for defining positive mNGS results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow, were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus. Sensitivity and analytical specificity of this mNGS protocol were comparable to PCR and higher when considering off-PCR target viral pathogens. One single test detected all potential viral pathogens and simultaneously obtained detailed information on detected viruses. Respiratory tract infections pose a great burden on public health, causing extensive morbidity and mortality among patients worldwide. 1e3 Most acute respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses, such as rhinovirus, influenza A and B viruses, metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. 4 However, in 20% to 62% of the patients, no pathogen is detected. 4e6 This might be the result of diagnostic failures or even infection by unknown pathogens, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012. 7 Rapid identification of the respiratory pathogen is critical to determine downstream decision making, such as isolation measures or treatment, including cessation of antibiotic therapy. Current diagnostic amplification methods, such as real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), are sensitive and specific, but are only targeting predefined virus species or types. Genetic diversity within the virus genome and the sheer number of potential pathogens in many clinical conditions pose limitations to predefined primer-and probebased approaches, leading to false-negative results. 8 These limitations, combined with the potential emergence of new or unusual pathogens, highlight the need for less restricted approaches that could improve the diagnosis and subsequent outbreak management of infectious diseases.",20.086101546120727,8.783005907119541

Patel 1 , U. Herber* 1 1 Accugenix, Marketing, Newark, Deutschland Accurate classification of unknown bacterial isolates is an essential first step in understanding the impact these organisms have on an environmental monitoring program. There are many methods, technologies, and strategies utilized to determine the identity of unknown microorganisms, however, the selection of these methods is often impacted by more than the performance of the technology. Cost, time and the amount of expertise required to perform an assay are major points to consider during the selection process. Current available methods of identification range from genotypic to phenotypic, with 16S sequencing being universally acknowledged as the standard for routine bacterial identifications. Still, there is even variability within this process as not all 16S sequencing methods are comparable. When identifications are based on phenotypic characteristics, the methods are more subjective and results can be impacted by many variables. The first practical proteotypic identification systems utilize matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization -time of flight (MALDI-TOF) spectroscopy for microbial identification. This technology is based on whole cell protein profiles that are subject to less expression variability than phenotypic systems. This study directly compared performance between several of these technologies, including metabolic profiling (bioMerieux VITEK® 2 Compact), MALDI-TOF (Bruker BioTyper™), automated DNA sequence analysis (ABI MicroSEQ® 2.1), and DNA sequencing with a referencequality, customized data analysis process and curated libraries (Accugenix). These microbial identification methods were used to analyze 60 unknown environmental bacterial isolates. Accuracy, as well as assay cost, time, and ease of use for each method are discussed. While 16S rRNA gene sequencing remains the standard for microbial identification of environmental isolates, proteotypic MALDI-TOF technology outperformed more phenotypic methods without compromising assay cost and turnaround time.",18.934359412164223,7.548617428560809

Genomicsbased methods have already allowed a significant advance in our understanding of the evolution and spread of bacterial pathogens. In the developed world, whole genome sequencing is being established for routine use in clinical microbiology, both for tracking transmission and spread of pathogens, as well as prediction of drugresistance profiles, allowing rapid outbreak detection and analysis in almost real-time, as evolution occurs in the wild [54 ] . Except for influenza A viruses, genetic correlates (surrogates) of the ability of a zoonotic pathogen to efficiently overcome the interspecies barrier and allow rapid spread within the human population are poorly defined. Any emergence of novel molecular patterns in microorganisms results from an evolutionary process driven by factors not encoded for in genomes and determined by the frequencies of genome alterations occurring under natural conditions.

It would be impossible to show all of the various nucleoside modifications that have been synthesized in each of these broad categories, however, it was our intention to provide a flavor of the historical progression of nucleoside development and the various types of structural modifications that have been pursued to date. As the field has progressed and new information has become available about nucleoside structure, enzyme recognition, and biological activity, new and more complex modifications have been pursued, including multiple modifications to the same scaffold. Those and other types of approaches will be reviewed in the second paper in this series.

In our analyses, we assumed that each mammalian species harbors an equal number of host-specific pathogens. With this assumption, we were able to use the global distribution of wildlife diversity as a proxy for the global distribution of unknown zoonotic pathogen diversity. This approach allowed us to show definitively that disease emergence is correlated with human activity on the planet, i.e. it is a product of human environmental change, and demographic changes. It also allowed us to identify the geographic regions on the planet where these factors and wildlife biodiversity come together to create the right conditions for disease emergence.

This is an essential methodological step in studies of malaise associated with URTIs. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of naturally occurring colds on mood and objective measures of performance. This was done by first conducting a cross-sectional comparison of 37 healthy people and 158 volunteers with colds and then a longitudinal study in which 100 volunteers developed colds and 87 remained healthy. Virological techniques were used to identify infecting agents and comparisons made across the different groups. The results showed that having a cold was associated with reduced alertness and slowed reaction times. These effects were observed both for colds where the infecting virus was identified and those where it was not. Similar effects were obtained for both rhinovirus and coronavirus colds. One may conclude that upper respiratory tract illnesses lead to a reduction in subjective alertness and impaired psychomotor functioning. This was true for both illnesses where the infecting agent was identified and for those clinical illnesses where no virus was detected. It is now important to identify the mechanisms linking infection and illness with the behavioural changes.

While studies of naturally occurring colds have confirmed that such illnesses reduce subjective ratings of alertness and lead to psychomotor slowing (Hall and Smith, 1996; Smith et al. 1995; Smith et al., 1997) no experiments have been conducted which relate these effects to the nature of the infecting virus. Indeed, we do not know whether confirmed infections produce similar effects to those clinical illnesses where the virus is unknown. In addition, the differences between influenza and cold infections suggest that the nature of the infecting agent may be crucial. Data from studies of experimentally-induced infections suggest that many effects of different cold producing viruses on performance are similar. However, subjective mood ratings have shown different effects of coronavirus colds and those following infection with rhinoviruses, with the coronavirus leading to reduced ratings of subjective alertness and the rhinovirus colds being associated with much smaller changes in mood (Smith et al., 1992) . These differences may not reflect the viruses but may be due to variation in the severity or length of the cold. This issue was examined here. Research on naturally occurring colds (Hall and Smith 1996) has failed to replicate results obtained following infection with respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV). Given that it is unlikely that the young adults with naturally occurring colds had RSV infections it does appear plausible that even different cold producing viruses may produce different effects on mood and performance.

Ongoing surveillance for an outbreak-and epidemic-prone disease can facilitate early detection of an outbreak, allowing a more rapid response and therefore mitigation of the outbreak. Epidemic meningococcal disease in the meningitis belt in Africa requires ongoing surveillance to identify outbreaks in the region. Cholera surveillance is maintained globally to detect outbreaks and requires mandatory reporting to the World Health Organization (WHO). Emerging and reemerging diseases also pose a big risk to public health. These diseases include both unknown pathogens that appear for the first time in a population as well as known pathogens that increase in geographic spread or severity or are reintroduced into the population.

By contrast to the broad susceptibility of MyD88-deficient mice to 46 different bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi (i.e. to almost nearly all the microbes tested), patients with MyD88-or IRAK-4deficiencies are susceptible to invasive and non-invasive infections with only a few Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, MyD88-IRAK-4-mediated TLR and IL-1R immunity is undoubtedly vital in infancy and early childhood, but gradually becomes dispensable, from adolescence onwards. Overall, MyD88-dependent TLR and IL-1R immunity is vital in both mice and humans, but its role in the course of naturally occurring infections in humans seems to be much more restricted than initially inferred from experimental infections in mice, as humans lacking functional MyD88 or IRAK-4 proteins are susceptible to a narrow range of pathogens, and only in infancy and early childhood. The different outcomes between experimental infections in mice and natural infections in humans may be due to species-specific differences, or more likely to differences in the modes of infection. In that regard, the study of naturally occurring infections in MyD88-and IRAK-4-deficient mice would be insightful, as suggested by preliminary studies [132] . In any case, the studies of MyD88-and IRAK4-deficient humans neatly illustrate the value of dissecting inborn errors of immunity underlying pediatric infectious diseases for deciphering the redundant and non-redundant roles of host defense genes in natura [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",28.047848692268886,10.18181073343333

Experimentally, necrotizing pancreatitis can be complicated by secondary bacterial invasion due to ascending infection from the duodenum or bacterial translocation, 49, 50 although the extent to which this occurs in dogs and cats with naturally-occurring pancreatitis remains unclear. Occasionally, pancreatitis results from hematogenous spread of bacteria to the pancreas, usually in addition to other organs (see Table 86 -2). Other microorganisms known to cause pancreatitis as a result of systemic infection include Leptospira species, Toxoplasma gondii, and fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans. In cats, pancreatitis can also result from invasion by flukes (Eurytrema procyonis). 51 When a primary infectious cause of pancreatitis cannot clearly be identified, the use of antimicrobial drugs to treat pancreatitis in dogs and cats is controversial. If used, the primary goal of antimicrobial treatment is to prevent or treat secondary ascending bacterial infection or bacterial translocation; treatment should target enteric bacteria. However, no evidence currently exists that use of antimicrobials alters outcome in dogs and cats with naturally occurring pancreatitis, and it has the potential to select for infection by multidrug-resistant enteric pathogens. In addition, many widely used antimicrobial drugs in veterinary medicine (such as β-lactams and aminoglycosides) penetrate inflamed pancreatic tissue poorly. Suitable choices include fluoroquinolones (for gram-negative aerobes), third-generation cephalosporines, and metronidazole (for anaerobes).",22.666792010880943,9.358806255922817

Naturally occurring porphyrins are fully conjugated (non-reduced) tetrapyrroles and vary in the number and type of side groups particularly carboxylic acid groups (uroporphyrin has eight, coproporphyrin has four and protoporphyrin has two). Porphyrins have the longest wavelength absorption band in the region of 630-nm and it tends to be small. Chlorins are tetrapyrroles with the double bond in one pyrrole ring reduced. This means that the longest wavelength absorption band shifts to the region of 650-690 nm and increases severalfold in height; both these factors are highly desirable for PDT. Bacteriochlorins have two pyrrole rings with reduced double bonds, and this leads to the absorption band shifting even further into the red, and increasing further in magnitude.

Preservation of sample integrity is essential for accurate test results, especially if detection or quantification of RNA is desired. Unlike DNA, RNA is unstable and is readily degraded by naturally occurring endonucleases (RNases) that are present in the environment and tissues. Samples for RNA testing should be handled with gloves to prevent contamination with RNases present on the skin. Samples for RNA testing should be promptly submitted to the laboratory or stored in a freezer at Ϫ80°C until forwarded for testing. Samples may also be treated with buffers designed to minimize RNA degradation, with several commercial additives being available for this purpose, but their use varies among laboratories. It is best to consult the specific laboratory for their protocol for sample submission. Although DNA tends to be more stable than RNA, naturally occurring endonucleases that degrade DNA do exist. Test samples should be aseptically collected and refrigerated or frozen until submission. The ability of PCR to detect extremely low levels of DNA in a submitted patient sample results in the very real potential of falsepositive test results due to DNA contamination.",20.844946126910962,9.624609433879971

Quarantine legislation designed to prevent accidental or intentional but illegal importation of unwanted organisms would be exercised by countries under current international obligations and should impede establishment in new countries if rigorously enforced.

New Zealand's experience with RCD indicates it is possible for lay people to illegally import and establish reproducing populations of exotic pathogens. In Australia, RCD breached a carefully planned quarantine on an offshore island. Unintended establishment and proliferation of engineered viruses may be contained if outbreaks are recognized early, and if proportions of susceptible individuals are removed rapidly from the population either by culling or by immunizing against the pathogen (Tyndale-B iscoe, 1995) .

Cepheid (http://www.cepheid.com/us/) has developed an integrated benchtop analyzer (GeneXpert) for the detection of several pathogens and resistance markers. They have a microfluidic cartridge where ultrasonic lysis and multiplex rapid real-time PCR technique are realized. The company has CE-certified cartridges for the detection of, e.g., Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or norovirus and FDA-approved tests for, e. g., MRSA or tuberculosis. Focus Diagnostics (http:// www.focusdx.com/3m-integrated-cycler/ud-intl) developed the 3M ™ Integrated Cycler for a disk-based qPCR-based analytical system. 96 samples can be run in parallel. Assays are offered for the detection of viral-caused infections like dengue fever, influenza, and infectious mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus) or for the detection of bacteria like Bordetella species or C. difficile. Idaho Technologies [now BioFire (Biomerieux)] develops a product series based on the FilmArray ® (Poritz et al. 2011) . This novel diagnostic platform combines automated sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, and PCR-based detection of multiple targets from a single unprocessed sample in 1 h. It combines nesting and multiplexing of the PCR (referred to here as nested multiplex or ""nmPCR"") together with DNA melting curve analysis to detect and distinguish multiple pathogens simultaneously. The FilmArray and the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch have since received FDA clearance for use as an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device. Advanced Liquid Logic (http://www.liquid-logic.com/technology) which was acquired by Illumina in July 2013 has a digital microfluidic technology that is based on the use of electrowetting to precisely manipulate droplets on a surface. For electrowetting, a voltage is applied between a droplet and an insulated electrode that can cause the droplet to spread on the surface and allows the precise manipulation of droplets within a sealed microfluidic LoC. Illumina is mainly interested to deliver the simplest and most efficient sample-to-answer next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflow (press release). DNA Electronics (http://dnae.co.uk/ technology/overview/) develops electronic-based microchip solutions for DNA and RNA detection. An ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) is used for genotyping or semiconductor-based sequencing. Whenever DNA or RNA is amplified, a H+ ion is released that can be detected by the ISFET. Therefore, specific hybridization events can be detected. Addressed healthcare applications are in the field of personalized medicine and infection screening. Another sensor technology is developed by GeneFluidics. The technology enables quantification of nucleic acids and proteins on a single platform with electrochemical detection. High sensitivity even in unamplified, unpurified biological samples is advertised. Results are delivered within 1 h. Sensor surfaces are functionalized by antibodies or DNA. After the binding event and washing steps, a secondary antibody with HRP (reporter enzyme binding) is applied. Signals occurring during enzymatic conversion of HRP substrate are proportional to the analyte concentration (http://www. genefluidics.com/technology). HandyLab, acquired by BD in 2009, developed disposable cartridges with onboard dry reagents and patented real-time microfluidic PCR technology. Cartridges could be run in a benchtop instrument that integrated heating, mechanical valves for fluid control, and fluorescent detection. FDA-approved tests were available for MRSA, C. difficile, and group B Streptococci. These tests and one further test (vancomycin-resistant Enterococci) were approved for use in Europe. Another interesting and completely different system is the lab-in-a-tube system (Liat ™ system) by IQuum (http://www.iquum.com/prod ucts/technology.shtml). All assay reagents are prepacked in tube segments separated by peelable seals in the Liat. The Liat is compressed by sample processing actuators of the Liat analyzer so that reagents are selectively released from tube segments, the sample is moved from one segment to another, and reaction conditions are controlled. You can start with a variety of sample matrices, including whole blood, plasma, urine, and swab samples. All required assay processes, including reagent preparation, nucleic acid purification, amplification, and realtime detection, are performed by the analyzer in 20 min-1 h, depending on the assay. Rapid PCR amplification and real-time detection are integrated. Products are the Liat™ Influenza A/2009 H1N1 Assay (research use only), a fully automated sample-to-result detection of viral RNA in 26 min that received FDA Emergency Use Authorization in 2009 (since expired), and the Liat™ Influenza A/B Assay (IVD product). Assays for HIV, CMV, influenza subtypes, and dengue are in the product pipeline. Roche, the ligation-based short-read sequencing technology by Applied Biosystems (SOLiD), and the Solexa short-read sequencing system that uses bridge amplification and sequencing by reversible dye terminators, later acquired by Illumina. The discussion of these impressive technological approaches summed up as nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) approaches is not in the scope of this review. A nice overview is given, e. g., in (Voelkerding et al. 2009 ). Since then, several other highthroughput sequencing technologies have been developed. One example is the semiconductor-based nonoptical sequencing system by Ion Torrent/Life Technologies. A pH-shift occurring during incorporation of desoxy-nucleotides in the growing strand is monitored by an ion-sensitive field effect transistor (Rothberg et al. 2011) . Today, even single molecule sequencing is possible (Pacific Biosciences; http://www.pacificbiosciences.com/), and technologies are being developed that could allow the sequencing of whole genomes through nanopores within the shortest time (announced e. g. by Oxford Nanopore Technologies; https://www. nanoporetech.com/). Nearly every DNA-based array platform has been mirrored to sequencing-based technological procedures. With the enormous high-throughput capabilities of NGS technology, whole-genome approaches if affordable can be performed, including transcription analysis [RNAseq, reviewed in (Mutz et al. 2013 )], targeted genomic or even whole-genome re-sequencing (Ng et al. 2009 (Ng et al. , 2010 Tsuji 2010) , comparison of genomes, mapping of DNA-binding proteins and chromatin analysis, epigenetics [reviewed in (Capell and Berger 2013; Mensaert et al. 2014) ], methylation analysis [reviewed in (Olkhov-Mitsel and Bapat 2012)], or meta-genomics [reviewed in (Cox et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2013; Miller et al. 2013) ].",20.178958625988702,9.902700748035102

Inoculative releases, as in classical biological control, may assist in suppressing pest levels below a nuisance or damage threshold. Certain pathogens are relatively easy to produce in fairly large quantities, but also are found naturally at low prevalence; for example, Beauveria bassiana. Other pathogens may not be found naturally in the area of interest, but can be very effective when applied, such as certain strains of Bacillus thuringiensis.

GRAIL Expression Is Associated with the Biological Activity of CD25+ T Regulatory Cells. D. A. MacKenzie, 1 C. M. Seroogy. 1 1 Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA. CD25+ T regulatory cells (CD25+ Treg) are a subset of T cells with an anergic phenotype that suppress immune responses in an antigen-specific fashion by a poorly understood mechanism. To date the only specific gene marker for this subset of T cells is the transcription factor, Foxp3. We observe a link between CD25+ Treg cells and GRAIL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase necessary for the development of CD4+ T cell anergy in vivo. We hypothesize that GRAIL is important for the development and function of naturally occurring and induced CD25+ Treg cells. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis: 1) GRAIL is expressed in naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells at levels 10-fold greater than CD25-CD4 T cells, 2) a tolerizing immunization in vivo leads to the induction of longlived CD25 expressing antigen-specific tolerized T cells. Gene expression analysis of these cells reveals that GRAIL mRNA is upregulated (700-fold increase vs. CD25-tolerized cells; 100-fold increase vs. naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells). Moreover, GRAIL expression is linked with Foxp3 expression strongly suggesting a suppressor phenotype in this induced tolerized population. As an initial step to understanding the role of GRAIL in CD25+ Treg cell suppressor function, we demonstrate that enforced expression of GRAIL in an antigen-specific T cell line is sufficient to convey a suppressor phenotype in vitro. These data link GRAIL expression to the biological activity of CD25+ Treg cells. Mechanistic studies are ongoing and will be discussed further.",21.530362905306625,11.451057896450214

This chapter has therefore been a challenge, with an attempt to provide an overview of the important aspects of MHV experimental biology while emphasizing the virus as a naturally occurring mouse pathogen. Even this has been complicated, as it is impossible to generalize with this virus, due to marked differences in the biologic behavior of the myriad virus strains, plus the marked effects of a large number of host factors. MHV was initially discovered in 1949, and continues to be among the most prevalent infections in mouse populations to this day. It is now known that the MHV group is represented by numerous variants that are constantly mutating, and that these viruses can be biologically separated into respiratory (polytropic) MHVs and enterotropic MHVs, with distinctly different patterns of tissue tropism. This dichotomy is emphasized for the purpose of discussion, but biology is never absolute.",22.446665140898617,9.765097054361359

Direct analysis of whole pathogenic microbial cells using MS without sample fractionation reveals specific biomarkers for taxonomy and provides rapid and highthroughput capabilities. MS coupled with various chromatography-and affinity-based techniques simplifies the complexity of the signals of the microbial biomarkers and provides more accurate results. Affinity-based methods, including those employing nanotechnology, can be used to concentrate traces of target microorganisms from sample solutions and, thereby, improve detection limits. Approaches combining amplification of nucleic acid targets from pathogens with MS-based detection are alternatives to biomarker analyses. Many data analysis methods, including multivariate analysis and bioinformatics approaches, have been developed for microbial identification. The review concludes with some current clinical applications of MS in the identification and typing of infectious microorganisms, as well as some perspectives.

The authors recently received 3 GB of compressed sequencing data, a mix of host and virus sequences, to assemble a 150 kb poxvirus genome; it is estimated that genomic data will soon become the world's largest consumer of disk storage. Therefore, one question that is frequently asked is, when will it be cheaper to recollect the data than store the data? Although storage of raw sequencing data is a somewhat different problem than the organization of genomes to allow maximum use by researchers, it provides a valuable illustration as to where our capacity for genome sequencing is heading. Perhaps, in the not too distant future, it will not be unusual to have our own genome sequenced, as well as our various organ microbiomes and the genomes of any pathogens we are infected by. To deal with the benefits of the new sequencing technology's ability to generate massive sequence coverage, which helps to reduce errors in the initial sequencing process and reveals the natural variation among the genomes of a virus population, we must also develop new annotation strategies such as how to annotate SNPs in virus genomes and gene fragments in the non-essential gene sets of large viruses. The goal of this type of annotation is to provide the virologist with more information in comparative studies. Often large viruses with different virulence phenotypes are compared through asking, what genes are in virus A and absent in virus B? The questioner is really asking about the presence of functional genes, but would likely be interested in knowing the mechanism of the deletion. For example, whether the gene was inactivated by a series of deletions or a single nucleotide change that could be the result of a sequencing error.",30.34548033304802,13.767224363085894

Competing catastrophes and research with pathogens with pandemic potential Fig. 1 illustrates a widely cited portrayal of the spectrum of sources of biological risks, from the specter of naturally occurring pandemics at one extreme to biological warfare by states or terrorists at the other. Both ends represent low probability, but high consequence events. The original purpose of the graphic was to convey a range of risks, and it is often used to encourage an audience to think about how policies to address one set of risks could help ameliorate others. The current emphasis on ""health security,"" in which increasing global capacity to prevent and combat infectious disease outbreaks provides important capabilities that could be deployed in the event of a deliberately caused disease outbreak is a good example. The Global Health Security Agenda, launched in 2014, acknowledges the essential need for a multilateral and multi-sectoral approach to strengthen both global and national capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental. Once established, the capacity would mitigate the devastating effects of Ebola, MERS, other highly pathogenic infectious diseases, and bioterrorism events."" 8 The figure can also be used to present a more zero-sum view of the risks, however. Could efforts to prevent one catastrophe increase the risks of another? For example, could policies to limit some areas of dual use research out of security concerns hamper vital efforts to prevent or respond to potential pandemics? ""Nature is the best bioterrorist"" is a common riposte to anyone arguing for the need to pay attention to risks from dual use research or sometimes even biological weapons or bioterrorism. Millions of casualties each year from naturally occurring infectious diseases offer a graphic contrast to the lack of any bioterrorist incidents since the anthrax letter attacks of 2001, which are sometimes presented as a ""biocrime."" And it should be noted that the continuing lack of consensus within the security community about the nature, likelihood, and severity of the risks from state and non-state actors compounds the problem of crafting and presenting a compelling alternative frame. 9 An example of this zero-sum competing catastrophes argument is illustrated by the ongoing controversy over research with pathogens with the potential to cause pandemics.",34.43157486117105,12.871319370455316

Nucleic acid testing is a method of testing blood that is more sensitive and specific than conventional tests that require the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. Also, NAT works by detecting the low levels of viral genetic material present when an infection occurs but before the body develops an immune response to a virus. This improved sensitivity should enable us to significantly decrease the infection window period, allowing for earlier detection of the infection and diminishing the chances for transmission of the agent via transfusion. We are not only to protect the blood supply from known pathogens but also the emergence of new and unrecognized and uncharacterized infectious agents [4, 36, 37, 75] .

Indeed, large scale exosome production and isolation still remains a challenge and ultracentrifugation is time consuming that may hamper efforts to use exosomes as vaccines. Moreover the composition of exosomes is not fully elucidated especially at the RNA level and thus artificial production of these naturally occurring vesicles with complex composition may be more difficult than originally perceived. However, if one considers that the HIV genome is 9.8 kb and packaged within a vesicle similar in size to exosomes, one could potentially pack 500 copies of miRNAs in one single exosome.

Even though the clinical usefulness of TEM has been gradually declined as the popularization of molecular and immunological techniques, it offers significant advantages in the detectability of viruses and atypical pathogens and the capacity of detecting multiple pathogens present within a sample by a single test. 13 Moreover, TEM examination of BALF samples only takes 48 hours, which means that clinical physicians could get fast information of what kind of infectious agents are existing in the lungs of patients. Unlike serological test and PCR, TEM does not require any organism-specific reagents for detecting pathogens. 9 However, there are several drawbacks to the TEM technique. First of all, samples must be processed individually for TEM examination, leading to a low throughput. The field of view under TEM is also relatively small, increasing the possibility that the region analyzed may not be representative of the whole sample, which could cause false negative results. In addition, the accuracy of TEM examination is dependent on the skill and experience of microscopists. Thus, in this study, 2 experienced electron microscopists were involved in imaging analysis of each sample to avoid misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of TEM in bacterial pneumonia is limited, because routine TEM cannot differentiate bacterial strains and provide any information of antibiotic sensitivity, thus, had few benefits to subsequent antibiotic therapies. So far, advanced electron microscopy (EM) techniques have been applied to microbiology in basic and clinical studies, including cryogenic electron tomography, immuno-EM, 22 3-dimensional EM, 23 correlated light microscopy and TEM. 24 When TEM is integrated with immunohistochemistry or other molecular labeling techniques, it would become practical for electron microscopists and clinical physicians to distinguish various pathogens on the strain level under TEM. 25 Recently, rapid methods of sample preparation and transportable EM equipment, which makes EM an easier and faster tool to use, have also been reported to improve the identification of infectious agents. [26] [27] [28] These studies and our data collectively support that in future, TEM may be used along with other diagnostic tools, as one part of a comprehensive assay system for microbiological diagnosis of severe pneumonia. Several imitations should be noted in the present study. First of all, no BALF samples from healthy volunteer subjects were obtained, which made the diagnostic specificity of TEM unevaluable and the interpretation of TEM examination difficult, which we plan to address in future studies. In addition, the major disadvantage of TEM used in this study was that it did not identify a pathogen on the strain level. Hopefully, the application of more advanced techniques and combined use with other microbial tests would enhance the diagnostic accuracy of TEM, thus further improving its diagnostic value. Moreover, even though TEM examination of BALF appears to have a potential utility in improving diagnostic sensitivity in severe pneumonia caused by nonbacterial pathogens, its cost-effectiveness is still unknown. Therefore, clinical trials with large patient numbers must be conducted to determine whether the implementation of TEM could benefit patients with severe pneumonia through promoting the prompt initiation of anti-infective treatments.",18.984316077356382,8.84853682546188

One of the popular areas of reporting is that of global public health concerns, such as the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and more recently the outbreaks of Ebola and SARS. The reporting of such global health conditions has drawn research attention, with researchers exploring the media's representations. Joffe and Haaroff (2002) examined the correlation between the messages portrayed in popular tabloid media relating to the Ebola outbreak in Africa and British people's patterns of thinking in relation to these events. The focus of the analysis was to explore how the people interviewed perceived the crisis as a potential threat to Britain and compared with this with media representations in newspapers. The aim was to examine if media representations of Ebola influenced lay thinking about the disease. Similarly, Washer (2004) examined the way in which UK newspapers presented severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as a danger to the UK public.

Very few countries have active surveillance systems, which can detect unknown pathogens via algorithms. The detection of new viruses following systematic processes is a rapidly growing yet young scientific field. Interestingly, the present work by Takahashi et al stems from a retrospective study of a single initial case and was not facilitated by a centralized clinical database.

Until recently these approaches lacked the resolution for characterizing direct contact. However, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology, together with improved ability to extract genetic material more cheaply and from smaller pathogen samples [6, 7] , now allow mass-scale characterization of virtually entire genomes of whole populations of pathogens (generally referred to as whole-genome sequencing or WGS). This technology typically offers orders of magnitude better resolution compared to earlier typing methods [8] . In addition, the increased availability of dense data characterizing the substrate population (e.g., identification of individuals, social groupings, contacts between groups, spatial organization, species compositions etc., and referred to here as denominator data) [9, 10] , and the development of powerful computational and analytical tools to organize and interpret large datasets, broadens the potential for application of such data to high-resolution epidemiological problems. Although their usage on a large scale is in its infancy, they share many properties with 'big data' problems in other systems: (i) although highly variable in size, big datasets are typically an order of magnitude or greater larger than what had previously been available, (ii) the proportion and coverage of data on the susceptible population of interest that is captured in the datasets are high, and (iii) the variety of data being captured is extensive. The opportunities presented by big data based on WGS are potentially paradigm-shifting, with existing smaller-scale studies [11, 12] hinting at what might be possible with very large datasets. Crucial to this is the integration of non-WGS data into analyses identifying epidemiological pathways because this can lead to a considerable refinement of our understanding of transmission. Although this is often conducted descriptively, 'epidemiological' frameworks are being developed that naturally incorporate genetic data with both denominator data and additional information on the transmission of the pathogen across the affected population.

Their presence in nature dates back to the time of origin of Earth. Various geological and biological activities have added variety of nanoparticles into the system. Naturally occurring peptides, celluloses, chitins, and many other such biological nanoparticles have been studied for their applications in various fields. Peptides are the class of biomolecules that form the protein structures in living systems. Cellulose nanoparticles are most promising biopolymers in nanotechnology. Their high mechanical strength and robustness make them a perfect material for nanomembranes. The surface of cellulose can easily be functionalized and therefore can be switched for variety of purposes . Chitins b-(1e4)-poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine are most abundant polysaccharides derived from many organisms including some fungi and insects. They can be easily processed into membranes and nanofibers. Chitin nanoparticles (50e100 nm) were prepared from acid hydrolysis and ultrasonication of chitin (Barikani et al., 2014) . Chitosan is a naturally obtained material from the arthropod shells, crustaceans, fungi, and algae and has been reported for its antimicrobial activity. It is the second largest naturally occurring biopolymer after cellulose. They are nontoxic, mucoadhesive polymers formed by deacetylation of chitin. Chemically, chitosan is similar as cellulose with a b-(1e4) glycoside bonded 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose monomers. Chitosan is potential bactericide against a range of pathogens especially Gram-negative bacteria (Chung et al., 2003) . Chitin and chitosan have widely been applied to fabricate nanopolymer scaffolds in many nanomembrane-based antimicrobial systems (Don et al., 2005) . Curcumin nanoparticles (2e40 nm) obtained from wet milling technique was effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Penicillium notatum, and Aspergillus niger (Bhawana et al., 2011) . Antimicrobial peptide nanoparticles were synthesized through biomineralization reactions with higher stability and less chances to be inactivated, for example, cationic decapeptide, KSL (KKVVFKVKFK) 10, isolated from a combinatorial peptide array was active against E. coli, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Calbicans albicans (Eby et al., 2008) .",21.575693299045607,10.321490358695046

Many genes identified in this study encode gene products that might play key roles in pathogenesis induced by influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. Results from this study have also provided a list of 28 candidate biomarkers that can be used for further testing to determine the potential use for human diagnosis or treatment. In addition, the identification of genes that specifically regulated in mice in response to these two pathogens may provide insights into the mechanisms by which the host interacts with these pathogens and useful information about stage of diseases and selection of suitable treatments. The distinguishing features of this universally applicable novel approach are that the detection of pathogens is based on differences in host gene expression profiles in response to different pathogens instead of detecting pathogens directly, and infections can be detected at a very early stage.",18.224632745750736,9.93771807155887

For example, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as one of the top antibiotic-resistant threats in the United States, 3 has demonstrated its ability to spread globally, killing patients from New Delhi to New York. 8 CRE strains often carry resistance enzymes like Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1), which can travel from bacterium A to bacterium B, enhancing CRE's ability to spread. Fatality rates are high among those most often infected-hospitalized patients with serious underlying illnesses, people who are immunocompromised, or those undergoing invasive medical procedures. CREs that enter the bloodstream can kill 50% of those infected. 9 CDC conservatively estimates that there are at least 600 deaths from CRE each year in the United States, 3 and global mortality is believed to be ''considerable.'' 10 But do antibiotic-resistant pathogens like CRE amount to a biosecurity concern? One reason this is a difficult question to answer is because biosecurity policy is a ''conceptual and practical minefield.'' 11 Over time, the definition of biosecurity has expanded beyond its original agricultural and environmental context to encompass human health concerns. 12 In the wake of the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, biosecurity was predominantly associated with protecting humans from bioterrorism. By 2006, however, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) offered a broader definition that includes not just potential biological weapons and other dangerous pathogens but also ''outbreaks of newly emergent and epidemic disease.'' 13 This change reflects a general trend toward ''securitizing'' naturally occurring infectious diseases once left to the public health domain. 14 Gostin and Fidler characterized this trend as the convergence of the ''high'' politics of security policy and the ''low'' politics of epidemic disease and other public health concerns. 11 However, antibiotic resistance is a ''slow-burning'' crisis compared with potentially pandemic viruses like influenza and coronavirus or bioterror events like anthrax letters or sarin gas attacks. 15 With a few exceptions, like methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), urinary tract infections, and some resistant foodborne bacteria, the public and policymakers generally associate antibiotic resistance threats with hospitals rather than the community or the environment, even while clinicians and public health practitioners continue to observe alarming increases in communityacquired antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In addition, although resistant bacteria are prevalent in the food-animal production industry, they pose a minimal threat to business compared to other diseases like H5N2 (''bird flu'') and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (''mad cow disease''). Finally, while nonstate actors could theoretically transfer genetic elements of resistance to biothreat pathogens like anthrax, 16 experts today are divided about the feasibility of technologically complex, large-scale biological attacks. 17 For these reasons, framing antibiotic resistance as a national security threat remains controversial. 18 ",19.330740120971583,8.90547283633305

Every possible way in which Sias might be expressed has been exploited, indicating a strong evolutionary selection pressure to achieve this state. Given the apparent restriction of Sias to multicellular animals of the deuterostome linage, these examples were once assumed to be due to co-opting of vertebrate genes. However, in every case examined, bacterial sialic acid biosynthesis appears to represent convergent (parallel) evolution, recruiting and modifying ancient pathways for synthesis of bacterial nonulosonic acids (3, 154, 155) to instead produce Sias (see below). In combination with independently evolved sialyltransferases that catalyze addition of Sias to the tips of glycan chains, this has enabled remarkable levels of molecular mimcry, involving multiple novel genes that can recreate sialylated glycans essentially identical to those found on host cell surfaces. Based on the discussion above about the role of Sias and SAMPs, (22) one can see the benefit to the microbe of synthesizing vertebrate host-like sialylated glycans. They could provide the pathogen with suppression of the alternate pathway via factor H (156), hijack host Siglecs, and inhibit the formation of antibodies against underlying glycan structures. Finally, Sias also serve to block recognition of underlying (non-mammalian) glycans by naturally occurring antibodies circulating in most vertebrates (157) .",17.6599470200951,8.510075312652715

In addition, for insect-borne pathogens, transmission is thought to be frequency-dependent, such that livestock or wildlife culling that decreases host abundance (short of eradication) may actually increase transmission. This is because vectors are likely to seek out, feed on, and infect the hosts that remain following culling efforts, and the remaining hosts will subsequently also be fed on by a greater number of susceptible vectors per host. 57 Control of frequency-dependent pathogens by culling would thus be expected to result in short but intensified epizootics that may result in additional human infections, with the exact public burden depending in part on patterns of vector feeding on humans and other hosts. 54, 58 Active or passive use of animals to divert vector feeding away from humans to protect them against infection, so-called zooprophylaxis, 59 has met with mixed effects because feeding on additional alternative hosts sometimes results in increased vector densities which may result in higher transmission even if a smaller proportion feed on humans. 60, 61 A more recent incarnation of this basic idea, termed the ""dilution effect"", hypothesizes that naturally occurring biodiversity may, in some instances, play the same role. 62 As with empirical attempts of zooprophylaxis, the effects of biodiversity, or, more accurately, variable host community assemblages, are not uniform with respect to risk of infection, due to the complexity of host-vector-pathogen interactions. 63, 64 A more direct strategy, vector control targeted at larval mosquitoes (including elimination of larval habitat), can sometimes be more effective and has even resulted in the local eradication of a disease. 65 In addition, recent techniques to develop vectors resistant to pathogens by infecting them with naturally occurring intracellular insect parasites (e.g., Wolbachia) offer some promise. 66 In many cases the most effective public health strategies in the long term will combine efforts by clinicians and public health officials to treat and alter the behavior of patients to avoid infection with actions by others to reverse the ecological drivers of transmission. The former is especially important at the leading edge of invading endemic or exotic pathogens where personal protective behaviors are often absent. Reversing ecological drivers of disease emergence requires identifying the causes of increases in incidence and targeting them with appropriate control measures, which requires integration between researchers, public health agencies, the government and the public. For example, risk related to specific types of land-use may be ameliorated by urban planning and by management of host and vector communities through landscaping, hunting, or restoration of ecological communities. Similarly, increases in incidence related to socio-economic changes may be reduced by prudent development and assistance following disasters and social upheaval. The vaccination campaign against TBE, for example, targeted at children in Latvia in response to the massive upsurge in incidence there in the early 1990s, together with a reduction in highrisk activities in tick-infested forests presumably as a result of enhanced awareness, effectively reduced the mean national incidence by 74% from 1999, with the greatest reductions seen in counties where incidence was previously highest. 67 Even modest changes in societal structure and socio-economic development can increase exposure to zoonoses; an awareness of changing risk would allow communication of appropriate warnings to alert unsuspecting members of the public. Prevention of the introduction of foreign pathogens is far more difficult because this is commonly an inevitable consequence of the globalization of trade and travel. History suggests that successful control requires prompt identification, swift action, and occasionally draconian social measures.",17.778313546298016,8.343900833647771

For these methods to be successful, a potential cause of infection must be suspected. More recently, multiplex PCR and multiplex RT-PCR were used to enable more broad-range testing based on panels of suspected pathogens. PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS) has emerged as a technology that is capable of identifying nearly all known human pathogens either from microbial isolates or directly from clinical specimens. Assay primers are strategically designed to target one or more of the broad pathogen categories: bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, or viral. With broad-range amplification followed by detection of mixed amplicons, the method can identify genetic evidence of known and unknown pathogens. This unique approach supports a higher form of inquiry, asking the following question: What is the genetic evidence of known or unknown pathogens in the patient sample? This approach has advantages over traditional assays that commonly target the presence or absence of one or more pathogens with known genetic composition. This review considers the breadth of the published literature and explores the possibilities, advantages, and limitations for implementation of PCR-ESI/MS in diagnostic laboratories. ( Any practicing microbiologist associates microbial detection with microbial stains, culture, and other phenotypic analysis. Throughout the past two decades, genetic-based detection methods, such as real-time PCR and peptide nucleic acid fluorescent hybridization, co-existed with traditional microbiological methods and were typically based on the detection of individual genetic targets; therefore, prior suspicion of the potential causes of infection was typically required. Within the past decade, multiplex PCR and multiplex RT-PCR were implemented to enable partial broad-range testing based on the detection of panels of likely pathogens. In some cases, true broad-range diagnostic testing was achieved using capillary sequencing or pyrosequencing approaches that interrogate clinical samples with consensus primers to both amplify and sequence conserved genetic regions, such as the 16S region of bacteria or the 18S region of fungi. Although previously described methods remain engrained in diagnostic laboratories, emerging new technologies, such as PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS), offer a new approach with the capability to identify nearly all known human pathogens directly from clinical specimens and the potential to identify genetic evidence of undiscovered pathogens 1 and genetic changes that may occur to alter sequences used as targets in existing molecular assays. Designed for both broadrange and target-specific identification of pathogens and their genetic characteristics, PCR-ESI/MS can identify minute quantities and mixtures of nucleic acids. Therefore, if a novel microbial genetic sequence is uncovered, it is reported and accompanied by information that describes its relationship to closely related organisms. As an example of pathogen discovery, one situation stands out and exemplifies the potential impact of PCR-ESI/MS technology. In April 2009, the technology detected the first US case of the novel H1N1 influenza virus 2 in San Diego, CA.

Because molecules promoting eosinophil recruitment and activation are likely targets for the development of new therapies for virus-induced asthma, we investigated whether eosinophil chemoattractants, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-5, and the chemokines RANTES and macrophage-inhibitory protein 1a (MIP-1a) [6] [7] [8] are implicated in eosinophil recruitment and activation in naturally occurring upper respiratory viral infections in children with acute asthma exacerbations.",24.510435539029157,10.327894869585574

In these circumstances, the source of infection is harder to comprehend, and several factors appear to be important: 1 . A proportion of calves may be infected with respiratory pathogens at a very early stage in life. PI -3 virus and RSV excretion has been detected in colostrum-fed calves only a few days of age and in a small proportion of colostrum-deprived calves removed from farms at birth and raised under isolation conditions. 5 Such excretion is usually associated with mild signs of respiratory disease that may well be missed under field conditions. PI-3 virus has on occasion been isolated from aborted bovine fetuses, 44 and antibody to PI -3 virus and to RSV has been detected in bovine fetal fluids. 15 · 17 Naturally occurring pneumonia has been observed in bovine fetal lungs and in the lungs of unsuckled calves only a few hours old, and histologic lesions suggestive of paramyxovirus disease have been described. 4 · 36 Udder infection, with excretion of virus in milk, has been described in naturally occurring Pl-3 virus infections of cows, and the strains involved produced respiratory disease when inoculated into calves. 27 These observations indicate that congenital or very early neonatal infection with respiratory viruses can occur. Genital and udder infection of the dam may also occasionally be a source of early M. bovis, ureaplasma, or M. bovigenitalium infection for the young calf. A proportion of calves, therefore, may already be infected with respiratory pathogens before being incorporated into a self-contained group and can subsequently disseminate infection to their comrades. 2. Outbreaks of pneumonia may occur when the same group of animals has been together for weeks or months with no history of previous illness, with no changes in management or introduction of new stock, and sometimes under experimental isolation conditions. Such incidents may be triggered by activation of persistent or latent virus infection within the respiratory tract. The factors influencing activation in the natural situation are not fully understood, but factors such as waning of maternal antibodies, the stress of sudden temperature swings, changes in weather conditions, or decreased dietary protein intake after weaning leading to reduced pro-duction of interferon within the respiratory tract have all been suggested. 25 · 55 3.

With the rapid development of advanced molecular detection methods, more and more viable but nonculturable pathogens have been found in biosludge. As for total prokaryotic pathogenic diversity, there have been reports about accessing the phylogenetic and functional diversity with whole metagenome shotgun sequencing as well as bioinformatics analysis with MetaPhlAn (Metagenomic Phylogenetic Analysis) tool (Lu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015) . However, none has conducted research on the pathogenic communities with amplicon-based sequencing of marker gene which is more cost-effective. And 16S rRNA, such as high-throughput MiSeq sequencing, might be one more cost-effective amplicon-based sequencing methods to predict the functional capabilities of bacterial pathogenic communities after conducting bioinformatics analysis with MEGAN tool or Tax4Fun software package. For the community of fungi and others pathogenic eukaryotes, highthroughput sequencing for nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is probably a method for useful molecule identification and sensitive blast searches and sequence clustering operations for the ITS region in eukaryotes can be made by some advanced software tool such as ITSx. Many of the detected pathogens, such as Aeromonas, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Klebsiella, Legionella, Mycobacterium, Salmonella, Streptococcus Vibrio and parasitic geohelminths or helminths have been reported and majority of these pathogens could cause severe morbidity or even mortality for human beings by inflicting respiratory diseases, gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, genital disease, skin and soft tissue infections, etc. (Table 1) . Among the detected pathogens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterococcus were vulnerable to AD, while Campylobacter jejuni, and Streptomyces, Collinsella aerofaciens, Streptococcus salivarius and Gordonia bronchialis etc. were reported to be much more resistant to and hardly removed by AD (Ju et al., 2016; Kearney et al., 1993b; Stiborova et al., 2015) . It should also be noted that some pathogens can be enriched, and even some become emerging and reemerging after AD (Li et al., 2015) . Furthermore, some spore-forming pathogens e.g. Clostridium and Bacillus species with high resistance to acute stresses can survive after mesophilic or even thermophilic anaerobic digestion, therefore creating a hygienic problem when biosolid is spread (Dixit et al., 2005; Guzmán et al., 2007; Lloret et al., 2013) .

These proteins are naturally occurring in most eukaryotes, and may play a role in nuclear transport, signal transduction, and innate immune responses, but no exact function has been established [164] . Each vault is a 70 nm organelle-like structure that is composed of three proteins: the major vault protein (MVP) makes up 70% of the complex, telomerase associated protein-1, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and non-coding RNAs [165] . Vaults can be designed to express heterologous proteins inside their central cavity. This is easily done by adding a specific sequence to the protein that has been determined to associate the PARP protein with MVP [165] . Vaults are not immunogenic themselves and do not lead to the development of autoimmune responses making them a good vaccine delivery system [165, 166] . Using the model protein ovalbumin, vaults were successful at inducing T C and T H responses in vaccinated animals. They were less successful at inducing humoral immune responses [167] . Vaults have been developed as vaccine candidates for Chlamydia muridarum infections. Inoculation induced both T H and T C responses leading to protection against challenge [168] . Despite the success with vaults their biggest weakness is that the antigen is contained within the vault cavity, which prevents it from stimulating B cells leading to strong humoral responses. Currently, vaults could function as strong vaccine candidates for intracellular pathogens, or for diseases such as cancer, but further development is needed for their use against a wide range of pathogens.",25.479120420582902,10.635892896362874

Initially, sequencing started with radio-isotope labeled sequencing products analyzed on slab gels. This slow process was overtaken by fluorescent labeling and capillary electrophoresis that improved speed and data quality of sequencing. Recently the next generation sequencing platforms have made possible massively parallel sequencing without the need for lengthy electrophoresis. There are two different approaches for next-generation sequencing. One utilizes sequencing by hybridization while the other uses sequencing by synthesis. Both of these approaches are superior in their ability to perform the task on massively parallel arrays that is made possible by high performance lasers and high resolution detectors. For example, the recent tSMS (true Single Molecule Sequencing-Helicos Biosciences) utilizes bright fluorescent labels and high resolution cameras that can detect fluorescence from single nucleotide incorporation. Similarly, SMRT (Single Molecule Real Time) sequencing technology developed by Pacific Biosciences utilizes an innovative zero-mode waveguide (ZMW) arrays to obtain very high signal to noise ratio for capturing fluorescence from single nucleotide incorporation. All the above mentioned sequencing technologies utilize complementary base pairing and enzymes to read the sequence. Recently, new technologies based on physical sequencing, like nanopore sequencing (oxford nanopore technologies) and a single molecule DNA image based sequencing that is claimed to generate 20 kb plus reads (ZS genetics) are under development. These diverse approaches and sophistication of nextgeneration sequencing has brought great challenges for bioinformaticists to tackle alignment, sequence scoring, data assembly, storage, and release of huge amounts of data. 18 The ability to simultaneously acquire huge amounts of sequence data when applied to clinical and environmental samples helps in identification of pathogenic microbes. Moreover, genome variability and evolution within the host can be tracked over short periods of time. These approaches were already being used in diagnostic virology for detection of novel pathogenic viruses and for mapping of resistance to antiviral drugs. 19 In recent years, several pathogens of veterinary importance have been sequenced world over. Wholegenome sequencing of microbes has revolutionized the methods by which these organisms are studied and has heightened expectations regarding the ability to predict potential targets for antimicrobial agents and vaccines. It is now possible to sequence entire bacterial and viral genomes or sample entire transcriptomes more efficiently and in greater depth than ever before. It is less expensive, quicker, and more efficient to access gene sequences by whole genome sequencing than traditional gene-by-gene approaches. It is desirable to sequence hundreds or even thousands of related genomes to sample genetic diversity within and between bacterial and viral populations. Molecular epidemiology using whole genome sequences of pathogens will reveal more precise phylogenetic relationships as compared to gene or partial sequences, thus giving an exact picture of geographical and evolutionary origin of the bacterial or viral isolates. The number of complete genomes of viral/bacterial pathogens has increased dramatically in recent years with submission of enormous sequence data in sequence repositories such as GenBank. Currently, there are thousands of bacterial and viral whole genome sequences available in the public domain at NCBI.",20.541818170975244,9.740702222020136

The initial step consists of integration of signals generated by molecular-based assays and next generation DNA sequencing and unbiased microbial characterization for pathogen source tracing, attribution and forensics.

Results show local spread with time-to-time medium distance jumps DNA sequencing technologies (i.e., DNA and cDNA forms of RNA viral genomes) is allowing the genomic characterization of previously unknown pathogens without relying on prior reference molecular information [69, 70] . This information is available within days, and even hours, of sample collection, and well before the development of animal infection models. Because of their portability, this technology will become widely used in the next 5 years in routine clinical settings. However, to be clinically and epidemiologically relevant, DNA sequences must be rapidly and effectively translated into actionable information defining pathogen characteristics (i.e., virulence or drug resistance), it must point to a source of origin, and discriminate a natural event from a manmade release [71] . While some government agencies are considering use of genomic information to develop next generation Level-0 and Level-1 detection/surveillance devices [72, 73] , there is no reference database where researchers can retrieve standardized genomic signatures and motif fingerprints to develop primer-, probe-, and antibody-based detection technology using reference moieties. The impact of genomic-based biosurveillance in public health and biodefense will not be fully realized until addressing the current impracticality of transferring the terabytes of genomic data generated by DNA sequencing devices to a centralized architecture performing analysis operations, as that might take hours or even days.

Causation is established more readily when an organism has a brief incubation period, when there is a readily defined source of exposure and when the pathogen induces an acute illness (microbiological features of frontal pathogens). Unfortunately, as was acknowledged by Koch and others, application of the original four postulates has serious limitations when attempting to attribute disease causation to stealth pathogens that can induce chronic, slowly progressive disease manifestations in an animal or human patient. In addition, Koch's postulates do not allow researchers to readily address naturally occurring environmental, nutritional, genetic and other medically relevant factors that influence disease causation and do not consider the pathogenic complexities induced by sequential or simultaneous infection with more than one pathogenic microorganism. As approximately 70% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in nature (Taylor et al., 2001) , understanding the comparative biological and pathological behaviour of a specific infectious agent across different animal hosts, particularly human patients, pet cats and dogs that share the same environment, might provide useful indicators of chronic disease causation (Day , 2012) . This is an important concept with respect to the mounting importance of the global 'One Health' paradigm that proposes much closer integration of human and veterinary medicine (Jones et al., 2008; People, Pathogens and Our Planet Volume 1, 2010) . It is essential that cross-species infectious agents are investigated in a collaborative fashion by integrated teams of medical, veterinary medical and other public health officials and that appropriate resources are allocated to permit this approach to be successful.

Microarray-based pathogen-detection platforms, such as the GreeneChip and the Virochip, 33-36 use 70-mer oligonucleotide probes of conserved genetic regions within each taxonomic group of viruses. Because of their length, these probes are more tolerant of sequence mismatches and therefore allow for the detection of unknown microbial targets. 37 Furthermore, the probes are updated continuously when new viruses and sequences are added to their associated databases. To identify a pathogen from a clinical specimen, nucleic acids are amplified randomly and then hybridized to the chips. Given the large number of probes and possible hybridization successes, the results are analyzed with the help of computer programs that use algorithms and statistics to identify virus hybridization patterns. Although microarray-based pathogendetection platforms have been instrumental in the detection of numerous pathogens, including novel ones like the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), 34,38 they still rely on some prior knowledge of relevant genome sequences. [39] [40] [41] The introduction of high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized the ability to detect novel infectious agents whose genomic sequences are completely unknown or are present in extremely low numbers. The highthroughput sequencing revolution started in 1987 with the introduction of the first automatic sequencer. 42 The first of the next-generation sequencing technologies was developed only a few years later, 43 but it took nearly 15 years of technologic improvements before it became commercially available. 44, 45 Currently, the most frequently used platforms of this type include the 454 large-scale parallel pyrosequencing system (454 Life Sciences/Roche, Branford, Conn) and the Solexa (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, Calif) sequencing-by-synthesis system, but this field is evolving rapidly with new platform generations regularly being developed. These techniques allow for the ''deep'' sequencing of clinical samples. The term ''deep'' refers to the depth of coverage or the average number of times that a single nucleotide is sequenced, and it allows for high levels of accuracy in sequence determination. [46] [47] [48] ''Deep'' sequencing methods can, therefore, achieve thousands to millions of simultaneous sequence reads per run, allowing for the precise determination of the entire genome of an organism. ''Ultra-deep'' sequencing, which is largely being enabled by platforms such as the 454 sequencing system, provides an even deeper sequence coverage and allows for several additional applications, including amplicon and transcript sequencing, which can detect extremely low-abundance genetic variations. 49 Because pyrosequencing techniques are based on the detection of light produced whenever a nucleotide is incorporated and do not rely on physical separation of DNA bases, these platforms can be run in parallel and miniaturized to any reaction volume that generates detectable levels of light, thus driving down the overall cost of sequencing. Nevertheless, the shorter reads necessitated by the deeper sequencing capacity of nextgeneration sequencing creates additional challenges for sequence assembly and gene annotation. 49 Although the cost of sequencing is decreasing, the analysis of the accumulated data is costly, time consuming, and computationally challenging. The analysis is complicated by the fact that computer systems will have to discriminate between the nucleic acids of the host and those of the newly discovered infectious agent. Despite these challenges, several new viruses have been identified using ''deep'' sequencing systems. [50] [51] [52] [53] Additionally, these systems have made subsequent steps in pathogen discovery, including sequencing the entire genome to '' Genomics is the study of the complete set of hereditary genetic information in an organism. With the advent of microarray technology and next-generation sequencing, numerous applications have arisen from the field of genomics, including pathogen discovery, epidemiologic advances, and a variety of molecular techniques that allow for precise manipulation of microbial genomes. As DNA begets RNA and protein, so do the fields of transcriptomics and proteomics follow logically from genomics. Transcriptomics, which is a subset of the field of genomics and concerns the collection of messenger RNA transcripts expressed within an organism, has emerged as a result of more sophisticated techniques that allow for the highly sensitive determination of low-abundance mutations, transcripts, and SNPs. Proteomics is the next major ''omics'' field after genomics, and it focuses on the complement of proteins, their modifications, and their interactions within an organism. With the aid of analytical techniques such as 2-DE, MS/MS, and shotgun proteomics, the field of proteomics has found useful application for the identification of biomarkers and mapping of epitopes that may provide targets for antimicrobial drug development. The field of metabolomics is a natural offshoot of proteomics as it uses many of the same MS techniques. A major difference, however, is that whereas genomics and proteomics provide insight into the potential of cellular processes, metabolomics gives an instantaneous snapshot of what is actually happening in a cell. Each one of these ''omics'' fields generates massive amounts of rich, detailed data that surpass the capabilities of manual data analysis. This therefore necessitates the incorporation of bioinformatics for the development of computer algorithms that are used to analyze and model data.

These Gram-negative alpha proteobacteria cause long lasting intra-erythrocytic and endotheliotropic infections in reservoir hosts and chronic relapsing bacteraemias following opportunistic infections of non-reservoir hosts (Chomel et al., 2009a; Breitschwerdt et al., 2010a) . Importantly, we wish to emphasize the comparative medical importance and pathogenic relevance of combining clinical, microbiological and pathological observations across animal genera and species in order to elucidate the capacity of a specific microorganism (or a combination of microorganisms in the context of co-infections) to cause similar disease manifestations or pathology in more than one mammalian species. Based on recent research observations derived from studies involving the genus Bartonella, we propose that the following postulate be added to Koch's postulates in order to assist in the establishment of disease causation by stealth pathogens: causation can be established if the same infectious agent (or combination of agents) is isolated or organism-specific DNA sequences are amplified from a naturally occurring pathological entity found in at least three different mammalian genera. Although the selection of a minimum of three different mammalian genera is arbitrary, the strength of this type of association would be supported by the fact that random detection of microbial DNA of a specific organism in a defined pathological lesion obtained from different animal genera, occurring spontaneously in nature at different time points, would have a low probability of being an unrelated occurrence. We suggest that the new postulate be referred to as the 'postulate of comparative infectious disease causation'. Examples involving Bartonella will be given below to illustrate the potential application of this suggested addition to Koch's postulates. It is important to acknowledge that some stealth pathogens may not induce infection in three or more mammalian genera with the ultimate induction of a defined pathological lesion and, as such, other postulates or other approaches would be necessary to infer disease causation for those organisms.",21.149754699678446,9.25007008196307

Recently some well-studied DNA viruses representing the Poxviridae family were tested for their sensitivity to MxA (48 ) . A cell line induced to produce inhibitory concentrations of MxA showed no antivaccinia virus activity, indicating either a lack of susceptibility of the virus or the existence of viral factors capable of counteracting the MxA inhibition. To determine if the VACV resistance to MxA was due to a virus-encoded anti-MxA activity, VACV and the MxA-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus were coinfected (48 ) . It was shown that VACV does not protect the vesicular stomatitis virus from the MxA inhibition at the protein level. Those results were extended to several additional VACV strains and 2 CPXV strains, thus confirming that these orthopoxviruses do not block the MxA action. Overall, these results point to a lack of susceptibility of the Poxviridae to MxA antiviral activity. Recently, naturally occurring allelic variations of mx1 coding for the influenza restriction factor MxA were investigated (49 ) . It was found that nonsynonymous variations in the GTPase domain cause a loss of both antiviral and enzymatic activities (49 ) . Additionally, it was demonstrated that these amino acid substitutions disrupt the interface for the GTPase domain dimerization required for the stimulation of the GTP hydrolysis (49 ) .

For example, diagnostic tests have improved dramatically, allowing us to detect previously unknown pathogens. While it took approximately 2 years to identify the virus that caused acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the virus responsible for SARS was identified in approximately 2 weeks. In addition, linking data from different laboratories over large geographic distances has dramatically changed the way potential food-related outbreaks are detected and traced. For example, PulseNet USA is a molecular surveillance network that has been of assistance in numerous food-borne outbreaks 91 and similar networks exist or are under development in countries around the world. New molecular diagnostic platforms, coupled with increased surveillance efforts to detect new pathogens in both animals and humans, will continue to improve the ability to identify new pathogens more quickly. 92 In addition, the promise of point-of-care testing may dramatically reduce the time it takes to rule in or rule out specific pathogens in the field, without sending specimens to reference laboratories. 93 In response to the threat of emerging infectious diseases, many international cooperative efforts were initiated to build networks to enhance surveillance activities.

However, the relevance of these experimental data to the naturally occurring disease is unclear, and it remains an unanswered question on how or whether the experimental data can be applied to the clinical setting in the field. It is the impression of many clinicians that in most naturally infected cats, FIV does not cause a severe clinical syndrome. Most clinical signs in FIVinfected cats reflect secondary diseases such as infections and neoplasia to which FIV-infected cats are considered more susceptible. With proper care, FIV-infected cats can live many years and, in fact, may die at an old age from causes unrelated to their FIV infection. Although FeLV causes more severe clinical syndromes, and despite the fact that progressive FeLV infection is associated with a decrease in life expectancy, many owners still elect to provide therapy for their FeLV-infected cats, and with proper treatment, FeLV-infected cats in single-cat households may also live for many years with good quality of life. As in FIV infection, diseases secondary to immunosuppression account for a large portion of the syndromes seen in FeLVinfected cats, and it is important to realize that many of these secondary diseases are treatable. Many reports have been made of FeLV-infected cats having concurrent bacterial, viral, protozoal, and fungal infections, but few studies exist proving that these cats have a higher rate of infection than do FeLV-negative cats. Thus, although FeLV certainly can suppress immune function, it should not be assumed that all concurrent infections are a direct consequence of FeLV infection. While long-term studies describing clinical outcomes of naturally occurring FIV and FeLV infection are lacking, modalities for treatment of secondary infections or other co-incident diseases are in many cases available, and by treating these symptomatically, the life expectancy and quality of life of FIV-and FeLV-infected animals can be significantly enhanced. Studies that compare FIV-and FeLV-related secondary complications (e.g., infections, tumors) with the prevalence of these diseases in the absence of FIV and FeLV infection need to be performed in naturally occurring studies to definitively demonstrate these associations.",20.90120322277522,8.445022666152632

It is also important to note that many organisms of different species produce similar classes of compounds, each suited for their unique composition and living environment. The fact that varying derivatives of a common class of compound are being produced by multiple organisms may be a solution. A virus that has developed resistance to a particular drug may not be resistant to other naturally occurring derivatives, which have the potential to possess similar, if not identical, antiviral activities.

Evidence from Fukushima nuclear accident and land markets in China,"In March 2011, 15 commercial nuclear reactors were operating in China across seven nuclear plants.

A further 125 reactors capable of generating at least 164,960 MWe of electricity were in the planning phase of development. After grouping the reactors into different plants by their project names, Fig. 2 presents the location of all 45 nuclear plants, each of which either were already hosting or were going to host one or more reactors. Most of these 45 plants were sited in southern China because of the uneven distribution of the population, the demand for energy and the availability of natural resources. Except for the ""Chinese Experimental Fast Reactor"" which is located close to the capital, Beijing, all other plants were located in coastal regions. Although nuclear power plants are more complex to build inland than on the coast, new inland plants are being planned in increasing numbers and it is estimated that they will soon account for 38% of all Chinese nuclear plants. Fig. 3 shows another significant feature of the new plants, specifically their ever-increasing electricity generating capacity. The first commercial nuclear plant built in China was the Qinshan Phase 1 with one reactor and a capacity of 298 MWe. Subsequent plants far surpassed Qinshan in their generational capabilities. Prior to the FNA, the biggest plant in operation, the Lingao Phase 2, had two M310-CPR-1000 reactors with a combined generating capacity of 2052 MWe. The average capacity of plants currently operating across China is 1507 MWe, with the plants currently being constructed having average capacity of 2047 MWe.

With the advent of rapid molecular diagnostic methods and next generation nucleic acid sequencing, researchers have made long strides in identification and characterization of viruses associated with PEC. The molecular techniques have also helped us in identification of pathogens which were previously not known. Regional and national surveys have revealed the presence of several different enteric viruses in PEC including rotavirus, astrovirus, reovirus and coronavirus either alone or in combination. There may still be unknown pathogens that may directly or indirectly play a role in enteritis in turkeys. This review will focus on the role of turkey coronavirus, rotavirus, reovirus, and astrovirus in turkey enteritis.",22.822556457147563,10.456161521304594

Timely understanding of the behaviors of these pathogens plays an important role in helping doctors and scientists in searching for treatment methods and designing vaccines. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has led to significant breakthroughs in the production of large amount of unbiased DNA sequence data from field and human clinical samples, providing the capacity to identify the sources of infection, and the virus evolution as well as host/virus interaction. In our study, using 454/Illumina sequencing, we have obtained large amount of whole genome sequences. We designed a preliminary bioinformatics analysis pipeline to classify these NGS reads. First we mapped our nucleotide reads to GenBank reference sequences using BLAST, and classified them by their taxonomic family, such as host, virus and unclassified. Then, for a specific type of virus (e.g. influenza virus, MERS coronavirus), we conducted de novo and reference based assembly of the reads to obtain the full genome sequences for further phylogenetic study. In the future, through advanced bioinformatics tools, we hope to get more detailed information from our large amount of NGS sequences of field/clinical samples, experimental data, especially in the following areas: (i) finding novel pathogens in unclassified sequences; (ii) virus/virus interactions; (iii) pathogen/host interaction.",21.570448841525405,10.718681395109147

Speaker's summary: Pathogen inactivation and/or reduction should be viewed in the context of shifting the blood safety paradigm from reactive to proactive thereby providing insurance against known and unknown pathogens that may enter the blood supply or are currently un(der)recognized. Based on the positive experience of PI for plasma derivatives (e.g., no HIV, HCV, or HBV transmission since 1987), it seems reasonable to apply this safety paradigm to blood components. Of note, a consensus conference held in Canada in 2007 issued recommendations in favor of rapid adoption of a PI technology even if it could not be applied to the full range of blood components. Despite these recommendations, PI technology for PLTs has been slow to be adopted in the United States. As described in Table 1, the reasons for this are many but it appears that the predominant impediment has been cost.",26.899186948102766,12.807666169312316

Experimental disease bypasses the critical early stage that starts as kittens with exposure to an innocuous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV).12 Naturally occurring FIP results from specific mutants that arise following FECV infection and FIP occurs in the presence of FECV immunity.13,14 Experimental FIP, in contrast, is induced in coronavirus naïve cats by an intraperitoneal injection of a large dose of laboratory cat-passaged and purified FIPV. Naturally occurring disease is often subclinical for many weeks or months before outward signs of disease are observed, whereas experimental disease signs appear within 2–4 weeks and rapidly progresses. Naturally occurring FIP presents in a variety of clinical forms, whereas the experimental infection is almost always effusive and abdominal. FIP in nature is also affected by a milieu of disease enhancing cofactors, while experimental disease occurs in cats that are free of such extraneous influences.15 Differences may explain why a small proportion of cats naturally exposed to FIPVs develop disease, whereas 80–100% of experimentally infected cats die.15,16 Our predictions proved correct and naturally occurring FIP was much more difficult to treat than the experimental disease.

In addition, these methods could be used to discover known or unknown pathogens in clinical samples, not limited to viruses. Likewise, these methods could also be used for surveillance to detect viral RNA from environmental sources, such as WNV in mosquito samples. This surveillance ability could provide valuable insight into what pathogens are circulating and provide an “early warning” of future outbreaks (48). Additionally, one would be able to identify and study multiple viruses from a single sample. This could be beneficial in understanding the dynamics of viral co-infection, such as HIV/HCV. Furthermore, these methods could be applied to parasite, bacterial and fungal pathogen discovery by sequencing total RNA that contains expressed pathogen RNA. Expressed pathogens could be discovered incidentally through RNA-Seq data. Additionally, it may be more cost effective for some projects to sequence RNA rather than DNA to detect pathogens because greater sequencing depth may be needed for DNA than RNA (24).

Chemoprevention involves the use of naturally occurring or synthetically/semi-synthetically prepared compounds to intervene in the carcinogenesis process during the initiation or advanced stages of cancer. These compounds can actually reverse, inhibit or stop the process of carcinogenesis [5, 6]. Plant-based compounds such as terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, xanthones, coumarins, anthocyanins, carotenoids, etc, have been reported to exhibit potent anticancer activity against a range of cancer cells in various in vitro and in vivo experimental models. These compounds have been shown to exert their anticancer effects via a variety of mechanisms including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis, modulating protein expression of various cell signalling pathways including the PI3K/Akt/m-TOR pathway, etc [7–11]. Glycyrrhiza glabra is an important medicinal plant with tremendous pharmacological activities which include neuroprotection, antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Though several molecules from this plant have been evaluated pharmacologically, one of the active constituents, glycyrrhizinic acid, has not been evaluated against breast cancer [12]. Keeping in view the role played by naturally occurring compounds and tremendous potential of Glycyrrhiza glabra in anticancer drug discovery, the primary objective of the current research work was to study the anticancer effects of glycyrrhizinic acid in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells along with demonstrating its effects on cell cycle phase distribution, cancer cell migration and modulation of the m-TOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.",22.612661032207477,10.140157757118029

Adjuvants have been defined as agents added to vaccine formulations that enhance the immunogenicity of antigens and induce protection against infection. Vaccines made from live-attenuated or inactivated pathogens can elicit robust protective immune responses because those vaccines contain naturally occurring adjuvants. In contrast, protein-based vaccines in most cases have limited immunogenicity although they have some advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. Thus, adjuvants are necessary to help these proteins become effective vaccines by inducing strong and long-lasting protective immune responses. Indeed, some protein-based vaccines have been successfully developed in use for human vaccines by mixing with aluminium salts (alum). However, new vaccine targets will require not only strong antibody responses but also robust CMI including T helper (Th) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Alum alone will be insufficient for such cases because it is a poor inducer of T cell responses.

Some authors—as Fidler and Gostin—put naturally occurring infectious diseases under the heading of biosecurity (Fidler and Gostin 2008, p. 2). They see this broadening of the security concept as an effort to release the concept of security from the “traditional state centred military-biased perspective” (Fidler and Gostin 2008, p. 6). In their opinion public health and security are unjustly two almost completely separated worlds. They refer to the concept of human security to defend their view (Human Security Centre 2005). Although there are divergent interpretations of human security, a common denominator is that the concept of security should be broader than national or military security. All proponents agree that the primary goal of human security is the protection of human individuals. This broadening of the concept of security implies that there should not only be attention for prevention of possible threats of intentional spreading diseases.

These measures could be applied in a general biosecurity policy. In fact some of them are common practice already in a number of countries and laboratories. An important question regarding the possible dual use of synthetic biology is a rather pragmatic one: why take the long and complex way of synthesizing a biological weapon, if in practice there are many more and easier ways to reach the same result? This is confirmed by the American biologist Drew Endy. He estimates the risks for the short and medium term very low. “From a security perspective, many people are concerned that it is now possible to directly construct harmful pathogens from DNA sequence information. This seems to me a real but remote possibility, and is likely best addressed by improvements in our capacity to respond to emerging infectious diseases, natural or otherwise, and to our public health systems. The more pressing security concern is to ensure that the tools and policies defining the future of biotechnology do not directly or inadvertently lead to a remilitarization of biology by nations.” (Endy 2010)",14.058273731194909,7.427716770254612

They perceive two main approaches to dual use technology: the Anglo-American pragmatic approach and the continental metaphysical approach (Pustovit and Williams 2008). According to the authors these approaches are based on different understandings of technology: the Anglo-American approach “is associated with technology notion as a sequence of processes and operations aimed to products with necessary and useful for people properties. The second one with enough neutral definition-understanding of technology as use of organized knowledge for aiming at practical goals by systems of machines and people” (Pustovit and Williams 2008, p. 2). In their view the Anglo-American approach is directed at concrete technologies, the continental one also at the role and intentions of people. The authors illustrate the ‘American’ view by referring to the phrase “dual use research of concern” that has been developed in the—already mentioned—famous Fink-report of the National Research Council of the National Academies (2004), the starting point and analytical fundament of the present biosecurity debate in the United States, and not only there.

Typhimurium), a common cause of diarrheal illness. S. Typhimurium normally resides within an endosome-like compartment called the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). However, observation of the bacteria that occasionally damage the SCV and escape into the cytosol enabled the discovery of previously unknown mechanisms by which pathogens are targeted to autophagy. These include marking bacteria in the cytosol with ubiquitin (Thurston et al., 2009) and marking those in damaged SCVs with the lectin galectin-8, which recognizes glycans on damaged vacuoles (Thurston et al., 2012). Both galectin-8 and ubiquitin are then recognized by adapter proteins (including NDP52, p62, and optineurin), which recruit LC3 and initiate autophagosome formation (Thurston et al., 2009, 2012; Zheng et al., 2009; Wild et al., 2011). In addition to their roles in infection, these same pathways may be involved in targeting damaged organelles in uninfected cells (Huang and Brumell, 2014; Sorbara and Girardin, 2015) and in removing protein aggregates, for example, those associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Rubinsztein et al., 2015).",16.363066586716318,6.906633448478749

The sensitivity/specificity tradeoff results here suggest that while model-based approaches (SNVer, Breseq) provide an improvement over ad hoc approaches, further significant gains in sensitivity are possible (without loss in specificity) using a quality-aware approach (LoFreq).

After six decades of efforts, the mechanisms with regard to killing bacteria of macrophages were gradually elucidated, but there were still no definite answers about how macrophages became more efficient bacterial killers. In 1973, North and his colleagues found that independent cellular factors could also promote resistance of infection without involvement of pathogens 2. Almost at the same time, David indicated that lymphocytes were the major antigen-specific cells responsible for microbicidal activation of macrophages 3. Soon after that, interferon (IFN)-γ, produced by lymphocytes, was identified as the first factor for interaction between macrophages and lymphocytes 4. It transforms resting macrophages into active ones which have stronger antigen presenting capacity and complement mediated phagocytosis, and secrete more pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as toxic mediators. As the first type of antimicrobial macrophage activation was recognized, it became known as classically activated macrophages (CAM, also known as M1).",12.880256390722229,6.069509149246485

What is more, it is almost certain that more unknown pathogen species and strains are yet to be discovered, given their constant, extremely fast-paced evolution and unexplored biodiversity, as well as increasing human exposure (Vouga & Greub, 2016; Trappe et al., 2016) .

The target of each strategy is to maximise the social welfare by incurring in the minimum economic cost. For interventions where travel restrictions are implemented 46 , the cost increases with the number of closed airports and the number of individuals that get stranded in those airports. The reward is related to the relative decrease in the global footprint of the disease, compared with the null case of non-interventions. In contrast to the mobility-driven strategies that change the population's mobility patterns, other solutions such as hand washing appear to be more cost-and reward-effective. A future research on the socio-economic impact of global pandemics and the cost-effectiveness ratio of different mitigation strategies (e.g. hand washing, vaccination, airport closures, mobility routing diversions) against disease spreading would evaluate the efficiency and significance of hand-hygiene interventions. However, while hand hygiene is considered as the first prevention step in the case of an epidemic emergency, the capacity of hand washing facilities in crowded places, including airports, is limited only to wash basins at restrooms.

Water is ubiquitous in most ecosystems, and, among invertebrates, terrestrial haematophagous leeches are abundant and can be easily collected in many tropical rainforests [3, 4] . Such non-invasive nucleic acid sources can mitigate difficulties of obtaining wildlife samples, particularly in remote areas or for rare species. Recently, eDNA/iDNA sources have been applied to monitoring specific wildlife pathogens [5, 6] . However, previous studies have focused on known pathogens, whereas most wildlife pathogens are uncharacterized and unknown. Non-invasive approaches to monitoring known and novel pathogens may be of particular benefit in ecosystems prone to viral emergence, many of which occur in areas where invasive sampling is challenging, such as tropical rainforests. Here, we show that both eDNA from natural waterholes, and iDNA from terrestrial haematophagous leeches, can be used to detect unknown viruses circulating in mammalian hosts (Figure 1 ). Using a curated set of RNA oligonucleotides based on the ViroChip microarray assay [7] as baits in a hybridization capture system, multiple mammalian RNA and DNA viruses were detected from both eDNA and iDNA samples. Congruence was found between host DNA assignment and viruses identified in leeches, and between animals observed visiting the waterholes and the viruses detected. Our results demonstrate that eDNA/iDNA samples may represent an effective non-invasive resource for studying wildlife viral diversity. Several of the detected viruses were novel, highlighting the potential of eDNA/iDNA for epidemiological analysis of emerging viruses prior to their emergence.",16.63414552073829,8.062301151865755

A comprehensive genetic analysis of the regulation of proteome of HDL isolated from a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice, Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), revealed widely varied HDL protein levels across the strains. Some of this variation was explained by local, cis-acting regulation, termed cis-protein quantitative trait loci. Variations in apolipoprotein A-II and apolipoprotein C-3 affected the abundance of multiple HDL proteins indicating a coordinated regulation. We identified modules of co-varying proteins and define a protein-protein interaction network describing the protein composition of the naturally occurring subspecies of HDL in mice. Sterol efflux capacity varied up to 3-fold across the strains and HDL proteins displayed distinct correlation patterns with macrophage and ABCA1 specific cholesterol efflux capacity and cholesterol exchange, suggesting that subspecies of HDL participate in discrete functions. The baseline and stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes associated with distinct QTLs with smaller effect size suggesting a multi genetic regulation. Our results highlight the complexity of HDL particles by revealing high degree of heterogeneity and intercorrelation, some of which is associated with functional variation, supporting the concept that HDL-cholesterol alone is not an accurate measure of HDL's properties such as protection against CAD.",16.76676111592989,7.284307238568358

We use a previous framework for the study of epidemics in structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to recurrent mobility patterns [7, 17, 10, 18] .To understand the geographical diffusion of the disease, as a result of human-human interactions in small geographical patches, one has to combine the contagion process with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. For the case of epidemic modeling, the metapopulation scenario is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, being the size (number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well-mixed, i.e., pathogens can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The second aspect of our metapopulation model concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. Mobility of agents between different patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the possibility of moving between them.",11.880127301612752,7.091320994277536

Such a model argues that high social adversity shifts investment in the immune system towards resistance against bacterial pathogens and wound healing (possibly in anticipation of physical insults), at the cost of increased susceptibility to viral pathogens. This in turn accounts for both social gradients in conditions linked to chronic inflammation, such as cardiovascular disease, and social gradients in viral infections. Consistent with this hypothesis, psychosocial stress predicts reactivation rates of latent herpesvirus in mice and humans (33, 34) and rates of respiratory virus infection for experimentally exposed human subjects (35, 36) . Similarly, low status cynomolgus macaques males housed in a controlled environment experience both increased susceptibility to experimentally administered adenovirus and elevated rates of coronary artery stenosis (35, 37, 38) .",10.941240666384767,6.979408591316486

Although the timeline of immunological alterations in sepsis is not well understood, the suggestive evidence demonstrated that the development of sepsis involves two distinct stages, an initial cytokine storm (hyper-inflammation) and subsequent immunosuppression (hypo-inflammation), which exist concomitantly and dominate in different stage (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Hutchins, Unsinger, Hotchkiss & Ayala, 2014) . The uncontrolled cytokine storm is responsible for deaths occurring within the first few days, whereas immunosuppression predominantly causes mortality during the later stage of sepsis. In fact, more than 70% of patients die after the first three days of sepsis, which might due to the increased susceptibility to weakly virulent pathogens or opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), indicating a failure of the host to eradicate invading pathogens (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Skrupky, Kerby & Hotchkiss, 2011) .
