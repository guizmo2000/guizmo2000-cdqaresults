In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",33.18270308669315,9.920453187958072

In this research, a SEIR model was built up in AnyLogic. The model input was, to our best, the information collected at the time of the case study (February 9th). In addition, several assumptions were made in order to predict the future disease spread tendency in Wuhan. The initial infections were set to 41, which was the reported number until January 11th [7] . The basic reproduction rate of the COVID-19, which depicts the average number of secondary infections caused by one patient to all susceptible population throughout the whole course of its infection [14] , was set to 2.68 in Wuhan [6] . The incubation period of the COVID-19 was set to 7 days [73] . The average length of stay in hospital was set to two to three weeks [74] and the probability of contact infection was assumed to be 0.4. Taking into account the fact that Wuhan has been placed on effective lockdown since January 23th, 2020, the inbound and outbound transportation has been effectively cut off and the mobility of people within the city has been drastically restricted, so the disease may only be spread within a flexible domain of susceptible population. Due to this reason, the size of susceptible population was estimated with the best fit of the real data at the time of the case study, as shown in Figure 2a . The repetition of the simulation was set to 20 times and the confidence level was set to be within 10%. Figure 2b gives a prediction of the COVID-19 spread tendency in Wuhan from January 11th to March 11th, 2020, which indicates a significant increase of infections is expected at the end of February.

COVID-19 is a self-limiting disease in more than 80% of patients. Severe pneumonia occurred in about 15% of cases as revealed in studies with large cohorts of patients. The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon α2b, interferon β, chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon α2b and interferon β are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",27.70084622375513,12.598646191808786

Second, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in this family range from mild to moderate, with more systematic symptoms and more severe radiological abnormalities seen in older patients. Generally, COVID-19 appears to be less severe than SARS. Third, an asymptomatic child was found to have ground-glass opacities in his lung and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in his sputum sample.

Before SARS-CoV-2 attenuates further to a much less virulent form, early diagnosis and improved treatment of severe cases hold the key to reduce mortality.

Compared with the previous two epidemics (SARS and MERS), the case fatality rate was lower and approximately 2% in COVID-19, and only less than 15% of patients would seek hospital services. However, the case fatality rate of SARS and MERS was 10% and 34%, respectively (18) . Results of a study in China revealed the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% for COVID-19 (27) and some studies reported case fatality rate of 0.9% in Beijing (28) . In another study, Jung and colleagues reported a confirmed case fatality risk of 5.3% to 8.4% for COVID-19 (23) . However, due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, there is a higher number of death cases in the recent pandemic (N=3043, up to 02 March 2020) compared to SARS and MERS (N=1871) (29) . There is a poor prognosis for the disease in middle and older aged patients (28) . In a study on 44672 confirmed cases in China, case fatality rate was highest in the group of over 80 years (14.77%), followed by the age group between 70 to 80 years (7.96%) and no mortality was reported in age group below 10 years (30) . Even though death outcome is uncommon in young people, a few deaths are reported in this age group in China and Iran. Availability of and access to healthcare facilities has likely contributed to increase in death outcome. As a probable explanation for the difference between fatality rate in Wuhan (3%) and other provinces (0.7%) in China, death rates are likely affected by shortage in health resources due to increasing number of patient who had sought diagnosis and treatment services in the early phase of the epidemic in Wuhan (31).",34.76877644700082,10.666049657909026

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",24.968351393844443,8.830860172179356

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers have been converted into 'Fang Cang' (temporary quarantine hospital facilities) for infected patients with mild symptoms [14] (Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for psychiatric hospitals in China to safely manage patients' major psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19. In addressing these challenges, future community mental health system reform is necessary to re-balance the system by re-distributing resources from hospital-centric services to community-based and primary care services.

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",27.762127237623794,6.6149729996791

This finding is in line with the results of a previous study on SARS-CoV-1 that was done by Wong and colleagues (15) .

CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] . Moreover, the pathological findings associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 showed abundant interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, dominated by lymphocytes, once again implying that the immune hyperactivation mechanisms are at least partially accountable for COVID-19 severity [17] .

Among such individuals, cancer patients represent a large subgroup at high risk of developing coronavirus infection and its severe complications. A recent nationwide analysis in China demonstrated that, of 1590 COVID-19 cases from 575 hospitals, 18 had a history of cancer (1 vs 0.29% of cancer incidence in the overall Chinese population, respectively), with lung cancer as the most frequent diagnosis [5] . Patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events compared with patients without cancer (39 vs 8%; p = 0.0003). Moreover, cancer patients who underwent recent chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of clinically severe events than did those not receiving treatment. With the limit of a small sample size, the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of COVID-19, and poorer outcomes, than individuals without cancer. As a consequence, they recommended to consider an intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery for stable cancer in endemic areas [5] .",31.78116179280639,10.978125865465463

Furthermore, the limited cancer patient population described in this first report from the literature, was curiously characterized by the lack of individuals receiving anticancer immunotherapy. Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [7] . Cancer patients undergoing treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) currently used in everyday practice to treat solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, renal carcinoma, urothelial cancers and head and neck carcinoma constitute a growing oncological population [8] .

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is formerly known as the '2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia', which was originated from a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in early December 2019 [1] . On the 7 th January, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified and isolated this novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between persons via close contacts [2] leading to COVID-19. Infected patients may develop severe and even fatal respiratory diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure) ending up in intensive care [2, 3] . Due to potentially serious health outcomes brought by COVID-19, from 23 rd January, 2020, Wuhan and other regions in China have adopted strict quarantine measures to prevent and control the disease epidemic [4, 5] . From 27 th January, 2020 onwards, all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in China have initiated an emergency response to major public health emergencies [4] . On Ivyspring International Publisher the 30 th January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global health emergency [6] . As of 18th February, 2020, the COVID-19 has caused 2,004 deaths out of the 74,185 confirmed cases [7] . Worryingly, on 17 th February, 2020 the China CDC Weekly [8] reported that a total of 3,019 Chinese health workers have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2, of which, six of them died [9, 10] including Dr. Wen-Liang Li, a 'whistleblower' who first declared the possible emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome pneumonia in China, and Dr. Zhi-Ming Liu, the President of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital in Hubei province.",32.4319084697063,11.045215430969579

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",31.27589452537149,10.09562956338413

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test.

First, several online mental health services have been constructed across different areas, however, unified national management and coordination policies are still inadequate, which could result in uneven distribution and wastage of medical resources, let alone evaluating the efficacy of these services. Second, online mental health services are the predominant assistance measure and therefore, some people (e.g., older adults) who may have limited access to smartphones and the broadband internet, may benefit less from the services [42] . Third, frontline health professionals may have limited time and energy to access to these services due to heavy workload.

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare. This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available. However, at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected, to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years, too. There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months. Some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in Italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels, and those above expected levels will then be attributed to COVID-19.",29.699466249104024,10.147385616273422

The only estimate of the rate of spread of the virus to date has been in the scientific work of Li et al. from the 29 th of January [23] . However, it was difficult to subsequently determine R0 parameter on the first 425 patients in Wuhan. The estimate of the R0 for COVID-19 in their article was 2.2, but with a very wide confidence interval -from 1.4 to 3.9. It is a bit of tough luck for the Italians, again, that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 1.4 exactly. This figure is well known to all epidemiologists, it' s the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community. It should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that, with more data, R0 for COVID-19 would start converging more towards 1.4. Unfortunately, the more recent data suggests that R0 is more likely to lean towards 3.9, implying an incredibly fast spread. Thus, the greatest danger of COVID-19 remained unrecognized in Italy until the 8 th of March quarantine measures.

By the end of February 2020, it was already clear in the case of COVID-19 that it would be successfully suppressed in its primary focal point -Wuhan. It was also already stopped using the first line of defence in another thirty Chinese provinces and surrounding countries in Asia.

Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) .

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",34.99981124437346,13.955542971022654

This suggests a possible tight interaction between the S1 domain loops in the modelled structure and the CD26 surface. Previous studies of CD26 binding have shown that residues K267, T288, A289, A291, L294, I295, R317, Y322 and D542 interact with Bat-CoV (MERS) spike protein [10] . Interestingly our docked model supports this despite the variability between these spike proteins' S1 domains, with the same CD26 residues in close proximity to the active region of S1 domain in COVID-19. We also observed additional residues (Q286, I287, N338, V341, R336) of CD26 predicted to interact with the S1 domain of the spike protein via van der Waals or by hydrogen bonding. However, regarding the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we noticed many different and unique residues (R408, Q409, T445, V417, L461, D467, S469, L491, N492, D493, Y 494, T497, T150, Y504) predicted to interact with CD26. Some of these unique residues of S1 domain are also predicted interact with the ACE2 protein [6] . This underlines the novelty and uniqueness of COVID-19 and its interaction with human target proteins. This observation guides us to suggest that COVID-19 may share infection modes with that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and that interactions with other targets also warrant investigation.",27.750385561043693,9.579006743017967

Depending on the CFR value, the government response toward COVID-19 may vary, and estimates of CFR can also influence the strictness of policy judgement and the extent of containment and mitigation measures.

First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases should be adjusted by the delay in time from illness onset to reporting. Second, assessing only confirmed cases among all infections can offer limited insights into the severity among all infected individuals. Third, ascertainment bias and IFR are reduced by a shorter virus detection window and lower RT-PCR sensitivity. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health officials will need to confront the uncertainty in the risk of death, and prompt identification of high-risk individuals using the approaches covered in this article is needed. Subjectively, COVID-19 involves mild infections among the general population, but the risk of death among young adults is higher than for seasonal influenza, and the mortality among older adults with comorbidities requires close attention.

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",26.096835676668466,9.866930845224294

From the Benchmark Registry database [23] , the in-hospital mortality in patients with CS treated with IABP was 42.0%. We think there were two possible reasons for the lower mortality rate of patients with AMI and comorbid CS in our study. Firstly, emergency revascularization using PCI or CABG is done in Taiwan for most patients with STEMI and comorbid CS based on the current American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) guidelines [10] and on our customary daily practice. Of 550 patients with AMI and CS treated with IABP in our study, 453 (82.36%) had undergone CABG, 62 (11.27%) had undergone PCI, and only 35 (6.36%) had been treated only with medication. Therefore, most patients with AMI and comorbid CS treated with IABP underwent CABG, and our in-hospital mortality rate was 25.16%. Hemo et al. [21] reported that the in-hospital mortality rate of patients with CS undergoing CABG s/p IABP was 22.2%. Secondly, AMI comorbid with CS in our study was considered a major disease.

Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.",30.32959326025105,9.372667903410292

It is also reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 6 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 7 have caused critical cardiac lesions. In the present study, we have focused on cardiac lesion biomarkers in severe and very severe patients with COVID-19. We have proved elevation of cTnI, CK, HBDB, and LDH in critical cases. It is important to notify that, in very severe group, 8/8 patients exhibit cTnI above reference level; while 1/26 in severe group. This suggests that elevated cTnI could be a potential indicator for critically ill patients. It is worth notifying that among the 8 critically ill patients enrolled, the kidney and liver function markers are not as significantly disturbed as the cardiac lesion markers, suggesting that most patients enrolled have not been suffering from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Thus, the consistently high cTnI levels in very severe group point to the importance that the heart injury could be a distinct, or even lethal feature in very severe COVID-19. Protecting from myocardial injury could be of vital importance in clinical treatment for reducing the mortality rate. The study was limited by small sample size. And we haven't analyzed the echocardiography and MRI for the patients enrolled. Further analysis is needed to determine the etiology.",30.091826946208002,9.232139159971666

The UNDRR asked national disaster management agencies to continue with the development of their preparedness and response capacities to include health emergencies as a top priority, alongside earthquakes, floods, storms and other natural hazards (UNDRR, 2020). It also highlighted the importance of silo-breaking in disaster prevention and management, notably the silos between disaster management and health workers. The UNDRR reiterates that the Sendai Framework emphasizes the need for resilient health systems and the integration of disaster risk management into health care provision at all levels. After all, Sendai turns the focus from disaster response and management to preparedness, surveillance and disaster risk management in the health context (UNDRR, 2020). Yet it is not clear whether COVID-19 is leading to collaboration between the WHO and the UNDRR. We appraise the speed and scale by which COVID-19 response funds are made available.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) announces $6.5 billion initial response to COVID-19 pandemic (ADB, 2020). The UN announced $15 million dollars from the UN's Central Emergency Fund to help fund global efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, particularly vulnerable countries with weak health care systems (UN, 2020).

Several abnormalities also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection. 16 In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation have been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3",29.406882536474562,12.187775496862622

In this issue we published two reports related to the COVID-19 infection [1, 2] . In most of those severe cases of coronavirus infection, the clinical expression is characterized not only by a fever, cough and other constitutional symptoms, but also by a clinical constellation including a cytokine storm, respiratory failure and eventually death [3] . Among the aberrant laboratory findings which characterize these clinical expressions, one can find leukopenia, increased liver function tests and ferritin levels reaching the hundreds and sometimes thousands of units. This panoply of findings reminds us of four clinical conditions that we have described in the past under the new syndrome -hyperferritinemic syndrome [4] [5] [6] . These four conditions include macrophage activating syndrome (MAS) [4] , catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (cAPS) [7] , septic shock and an adverse reaction to the biological compound anti-CD-28 [8] . This reaction to the drug was observed in a short therapeutic trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in which 6 individuals were hospitalized in the intensive care unit with a cytokine storm following the therapy [8] . All the above conditions are characterized by high ferritin levels, a cytokine storm (especially of inflammatory cytokines such as Il-1, Il-6, Il-17, etc.) and a high mortality rate that is over 50%. The 6 hospitalized individuals from the aforementioned anti-CD-28 trial did not die as they were immediately rushed to the intensive care unit [8, 9] . In the other 3 conditions, we were able to reduce the morality rate significantly below 50% using combined therapies with corticosteroids, antibiotics, IVIG (intra-venous gamma-globulins) and anticytokinic therapy (anti-IL-1 and/or anti-IL-6) [10] [11] [12] . The resemblance between these clinical conditions and those of COVID-19, suggests that the very severe cases of the coronavirus are associated with a clinical picture similar to that of the macrophage activating syndrome (MAS), which is unsurprisingly associated with high levels of ferritin. Therefore, the enigma regarding the high mortally rate associated with COVID-19 is most probably explained by a cytokine storm. Understanding this pathogenetic pathway may lead to better therapy and better survival rates. We will consider this further in our discussion of therapy.",30.867539725812495,11.811839889227624

In order for the virus to complete entry into the cell following this initial process, the spike protein has to be primed by an enzyme called a protease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) uses a protease called TMPRSS2 to complete this process. 10, 11 In order to attach virus receptor (spike protein) to its cellular ligand (ACE2), activation by TMPRSS2 as a protease is needed (Fig. 4) . 10 After the virus enters the host cell and uncoats, the genome is transcribed and then translated. Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicate, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene. 12 The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins. Besides RNAdependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3 0 -to-5 0 exoribonuclease, 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1 0 -phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic Genotype and phenotype of COVID- 19 3 phosphodiesterase activities. 13, 14 The proteins are assembled at the cell membrane and genomic RNA is incorporated as the mature particle forms by budding from the internal cell membranes. 15",27.807345779085615,9.393235645538132

Summary,"The effective cure rate of QPD against COVID-19 is over 90 %.

The network pharmacology analysis showed that QPD has an overall regulatory effect via multi-component and multi-target. The primary site of pharmacological action is the lung, as 16 herbs to lung meridian, which indicated that the decoction is mainly specific for lung diseases. In addition, it can play the role of dehumidification through the rise and fall of the spleen and stomach, and exhibited the protection for heart, kidney and other organs. Among the potential targets screen, most of them co-expressed with ACE-2, the receptor of COVID-19, indicating the potential improvement of COVID-19. It can inhibit the replication of COVID-19 by acting on multiple ribosomal proteins. COVID-19 can lead to strong immune response and inflammatory storm [4] . Functional enrichment analysis showed that QPD could inhibit and alleviate excessive immune response and eliminate inflammation by regulating immune related pathway and cytokine action related pathway [5] .

While other zoonotic coronaviruses, including the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), had higher associated case fatality rates of 9.6% and 34.4%, respectively (15), COVID-19 has resulted in many more deaths than both of these prior outbreaks combined, an issue that is in part related to the greater infectivity and higher attack rate of this virus, leading to a larger number of infected patients (15, 16) . Uncertain and inconsistent disease ascertainment have resulted in variability in reported case fatality rates for several reasons, including: 1) the disease may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in a large proportion of patients (15) , 2) inadequate testing capabilities in most geographies, leading to frequent underdiagnosis, especially in patients with less serious illness, and 3) complications and death often ensue much later than contagion (typically between 2 and 3 weeks after infection).

Children account for the minority of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and appear to be less susceptible to severe disease, possibly due to stronger innate immunity, fewer comorbidities, differences in maturation of viral receptors, and/or prior exposure to other coronavirus species (22) .

Summary,"TCM has own characteristics such as holistic concept, balance of Yin and Yang, syndrome differentiation and treatment, strengthening the body resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors. TCM has thousands of years of experience in regulating the body and enhancing the resistance to epidemic diseases, with unique insights and prevention and control experience. For mild and common patients, the early intervention of TCM can effectively prevent the disease from transforming into severe and critical disease. In the severe cases, TCM has won time for rescuing them by improving symptoms (http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/ xwbfbh/wqfbh/42311/42560/index.htm). Treatment practice of COVID-19 showed that early intervention of TCM is important way to improve cure rate, shorten the course of disease, delay disease progression and reduce mortality rate. Furthermore, the reason why TCM works is not only to inhibit the virus, but might block the infection, regulate the immune response, cut off the inflammatory storm, and promote the repair of the body. Moreover, the prevention and control measures of COVID-19 fully reflect the ideology of ""preventive treatment of disease"". Apart from the epidemic diseases recorded in the Han Dynasty should be isolated, the preventive measures of TCM also include psychology, sports, diet, medication, etc.",26.878700037163885,7.77901529150887

The best available data do not provide a clear indication of which pathway will be dominant. On the one hand, our estimates of the proportion of health-care workers with child-care obligations might be optimistic because non-working adults might not be able to provide care or might require care themselves. On the other hand, it is possible that family members outside the household (eg, grandparents), neighbours, or friends could care for children, though no data are available in the CPS on these possibilities. Feng and colleagues 16 have cautioned that older people might become primary caregivers in this scenario, which puts this sensitive group at greater risk of infection. Critical level of the percent increase in mortality resulting from health-care workforce absenteeism associated with child-care obligations induced by school closures, κ, that would offset the mortality reduction achieved by school closures through case reductions (colour scale). The actual percent increase in mortality must be lower than κ to justify closing schools. The red point, κ=0·176, indicates the best national estimate of cases avoided because of school closures (15%, 95% CI 13-17) and the mean estimate of unmet child-care obligations in the health-care workforce, 15%.

What we know about distancing policies is based largely on models of influenza, 4, 17 in which children are a vulnerable group for morbidity. Anderson and colleagues 18 emphasised that children do not appear to be a sensitive group to COVID-19, and preliminary data on COVID-19 suggest that children are a small fraction of cases and might be less vulnerable than older adults. 19 If these early results hold up, then the already uncertain benefits of transmission reduction from school closures will be reduced compared with those from influenza. Conversely, school closures might be implemented earlier in COVID-19 outbreaks, which might lead to greater levels of prevented cases. Furthermore, school closures might lead to other adults staying home, which could also reduce cases. These are all important questions when considering school closures.",32.392610953480805,11.611719675603789

We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. , the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·5-29·1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3-12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·8-15·2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality.

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members. In addition, we remind the public not to panic, but to prevent it scientifically.",26.545006914954016,8.629537691580474

However, a systematic study on these aspects has not been done. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Kelvin To and colleagues 4 report the viral load and antibody profiles of a cohort of 23 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In these patients, the viral load peaked during the first week of illness then gradually declined over the second week. Viral load was also shown to correlate with age. Furthermore, both IgG and IgM antibodies started to increase on around day 10 after symptom onset, and most patients had seroconversion within the first 3 weeks. Finally, the IgG and IgM antibody level against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor binding domain correlated with neutralising activity.",32.173940668568356,12.099639465434223

Different virus epidemics take place throughout the world every year, but only a few rise to the level of public concern (Schlagenhauf and Ashraf, 2003; Viboud and Simonsen, 2012; WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), swine influenza A H1N1 virus (H1N1), and Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola) brought on the public's attention because they caused many severe infections and thousands of deaths (Dawood et al., 2012; Nicholls et al., 2003; WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014; ) . Similarly, the disease COVID-19 caused by a coronavirus (2019-nCoV) brought world-wide attention and caused public panic because many deaths had been reported without being put in the context of the many mild infections and its potentially low case fatality rate (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . For example, despite being a common infection, influenza rarely causes public concern because even though it is common, it leads to death in only 0.1% of cases. A variety of reports indicate that 2019-nCoV is highly infectious through multiple routes (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . While the high infection rate is certain, the mortality rate of COVID-19 has not been definitively determined. It is reasonable to suspect that the deaths of six of the first 41 patients (15%) in Wuhan (Huang et al., 2020) in the earliest reports by Chinese scholars were inaccurate.

The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Recently, a study posted in medRxiv 4 has reported neurological manifestations in COVID-19 in the current outbreak that involved 214 patients, of which 78 (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations, which affirms our rationale of the neurotropic potential in the COVID-19 virus.

As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19.

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement. Also, a staging system based on the severity and organ involvement is needed in COVID-19 in order to rank the patients for aggressive or conventional treatment modalities.

In addition, one unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3. However, both 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [-7.50% (95% CI: -10.99%, -3.88%) and -11.41% (95% CI: -19.68%, -2.29%)]. In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may also be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.",28.06249027012943,10.412740042266304

Generally, the curves tended to be not associated with COVID-19 mortality for DTR but were strongly positive for temperature. In addition, the curves associated with relative humidity and absolute humidity presented similar linear trends, which indicated that the higher level of humidity might cause decrease in the COVID-19 mortality. To confirm these results, lag and cumulative effects were discussed in the following analysis. Researchers confirmed that respiratory infection was enhanced during unusually cold and low humidity conditions (Davis et al., 2016) , indicating low humidity might also be an important risk factor for respiratory diseases. A 25-year study found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality, and low-humidity levels might cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms (Barreca, 2012) , similar to a study carried out in the United States (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012) . Consistent to these findings, our results also indicate that the risk of dying from COVID-19 decreases only with absolute humidity increasing. Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread (Lowen et al., 2007) . Moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is efficient under cold, dry conditions (Steel et al., 2011) , and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity (Shaman et al., 2009 ), which may be very similar to coronavirus. Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ",29.650530103987396,10.191801291283051

These were exemplified in health care professionals correcting preliminary and false assumptions online in the treatment of COVID-19, which included (1) the improper cessation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors, angiotensinreceptor-blockers, and low-dose acetylsalicylic-acid in patients with stable cardiovascular disease, and; 2 (2) the ingestion of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin as treatment of COVID-19, which is not recommended without proper physician supervision due to the risk of QT prolongation. 3 Critical medical leadership is urgently required at all levels of our health systems. Now is the time for collaboration, rather than fragmentation, to provide the necessary care for our patients, whilst bettering our understanding of the complexities brought upon individuals' cardiovascular health due to COVID-19.

To limit the virus spread, those in the USA are canceling both smaller (∼100 people) and large meetings, researchers are limiting their travel both overseas and within the country, and student college and graduate school visit weekends are being postponed or stopped altogether. Still, there is much uncertainty about how to proceed and what other measures should be taken. Since the outbreak began in China, Chinese scientists have already faced many of the questions that those of us in other locations are now asking. We therefore asked several Chinese scientists to discuss the strategies that they are pursuing to limit the impact of the virus both on their research and on society. Some of the actions taken by the scientists and the government under this extreme situation may have a long-term influence and shift our future research and funding paradigm. We anticipate that their perspectives will be valuable to the community. global lifethreatening concern in recent days. The war against COVID-19 there has now reached the most critical moment, as confirmed COVID-19 cases have peaked for several days, and almost all the people in Wuhan City have been screened for suspected case identification (as of late February). We cannot imagine how people there are sacrificing to control the spread of COVID-19. As alumni of Wuhan University that is located in the center of Wuhan city, we became deeply saddened and worried as we watched the entire city cope with an unprecedented emergency situation. We wanted to provide a glimpse of what chemical biologists have been working on, from the perspective of scientists in China. In the past 40 days, we have heard more stories of hope and resilience than of worry and grief in China, where 1.4 billion people are doing their best to bring this serious outbreak under control. Right now, the epidemic situation outside Hubei is gradually improving, and the situation inside Hubei has shown signs of stabilization. It is noteworthy that although it is mandated that most people have to stay at home as a quarantine procedure, scientists in China have been increasingly devoted to combating COVID-19, with several clinical trials currently underway. As for scientists throughout the world, researchers in China are making extraordinary efforts toward rapid advancement of diagnostic and treatment approaches, and are doing so under highly challenging personal circumstances with extensive restrictions on not only travel, but day-to-day activities. As mentioned by WHO officers, Chinese scientists have been extremely professional in the face of this epidemic and have made their findings rapidly available to researchers around the world to coordinate global efforts to characterize, treat, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. One team led by Yongzhen Zhang from Fudan University completed the deep sequencing of COVID-19 and made its whole genome sequence publicly available on January 10, 2020. 1 Medical experts, virologists, structural biologists, and medicinal chemists have made significant contributions in areas such as epidemic prevention and control, patient treatment, virus classification and traceability, structure analysis, and clinical drug development. The current progress relied on the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the dedication of scientific researchers.

The APhA has also recently issued a tool --Preparedness and Prevention Guidance during Coronavirus Pandemic --to help pharmacists be prepared. 3 For preparing clinicians to respond to health threats and emergencies related to disease outbreaks and disasters, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) is a vital information source. 3 In addition, many reference documents are now being made available to pharmacists so they can have access to the latest updates regarding COVID-19 management. The American Society of Hospital Pharmacists (ASHP) has recently initiated a comprehensive online resource that includes most of the COVID-19-related pharmacy information and free, 60-day open access to ASHP drug information. 4 It should be noted that pharmacists should regularly review these pharmaceutical recommendations because changes are expected as information about the virus accumulates. Below are directions to some of these online resources: patients, they need to pay attention to protecting themselves. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthcare staff wear appropriate eye protection, surgical masks, long-sleeved gowns and gloves when entering a room containing suspected or confirmed COVID-19-infected individuals. WHO has also recommended using a particulate respirator that is at least as protective as a US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified N95 when performing aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation or manual ventilation before intubation or bronchoscopy). 5 However, self-isolation of pharmacists who have been in contact with suspected COVID-19 individuals are not obliged to wear these unless otherwise ordered by health protection professionals. 6",29.05801742287275,9.516371453842806

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases. [7] [8] [9] More recent descriptions of patients in China also noted around 10% of patients were also noted to have elevated total bilirubin levels. 8 Gastroenterologists should be aware of these potential gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.",28.858687799307205,10.33743049367902

Methods: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]).

General measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection will be of utmost importance for these patients. Depending on the local infrastructure, implementation of COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals is warranted. However, based on the local COVID-19-burden, a sharp separation of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" wards/hospitals may not be sustainable, although recent evidence provides somewhat reassuring data regarding the absence of environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA of inanimate surfaces outside patient rooms. 20 Wherever possible, patients with chronic liver disease requiring inpatient care for non-COVID-19 causes should be admitted to COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals. As these institutions may not be able to provide specialised hepatology-care, similar to our recommendations on outpatient care, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information to facilitate immediate hepatology consultations. However, due to the contagiousness of the virus, patients with underlying liver disease will become infected and will subsequently require inpatient care for COVID-19. With regards to nosocomial-infections, recent observations from Spain that compared patient characteristics between patients with community-acquired influenza and nosocomial-acquired influenza could not detect a significant difference between these cohorts with regards to underlying chronic liver disease. 21 Whether these observations will also hold up in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be proven.

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",35.80646648126568,12.492456056090235

COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality. We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households. 5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities. We need to continue to inform, advocate for, and empower local communities and to lobby governments and policymakers to ensure that tuberculosis, as well as COVID-19, remain high on the global agenda.

The newly emerging 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was identified initially in Wuhan, China. Since its first description in December 2019, the total number of cases as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) had reached 191,127confirmed cases on February 18, 2020, with 7807 deaths [2] . The clinical picture and radiographic presentations were recently described [3, 4] and the clinical picture in nine pregnant women [5] were similar to non-pregnant women [3, 4] . One study showed that 15 pregnant patients with COVID-19 had mild disease [6] . All of the pregnant patients in one study and 66.7% of pregnant COVID-19 patients had C-section, moreover all the newborn survived [5, 6] . However, 4 of 9 (44%) pregnant COVID-19 patients had premature delivery [5] . In a previous study of MERS-CoV, there were 11 pregnant women [7] . A comparison between MERS-CoV and COVID-19 cases in pregnancy is shown in Table 1 . There was no difference in the age group of the patients, however, the gestational age was lower among MERS-CoV than COVID-19 patients. Of the MERS-CoV cases in pregnancy, 63.6% required intensive care unit admission and this is comparable to 50% of SARS pregnant women [8] . There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] . Thus, similar to the difference in the clinical presentation and course among SARS, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, there is also differences in the outcome and course of pregnant women with these coronaviruses' infection. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and outcome would guide healthcare authorities and public health on further risk mitigation and advise for pregnant women around the world.

Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths.

The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptibleinfected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21 st 2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 260 0 0 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,0 0 0.

Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate.

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",29.65109974290229,8.78513051172946

Recently, global influenza associated with respiratory mortality is occurring at a higher frequency than what has been previously reported 5 . From September 2019 through the present day, there have been more than 170,000 patients with influenza in the United States, more than half of whom have been infected with the influenza A (H1N1) virus. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia induced by influenza is 6.8% 6 . During the H1N1 global epidemic in 2009, Jain et al. found that 5% of patients with H1N1 influenza were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and 7% died 7 .",32.07688818825887,9.873333183514696

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients.

[3] Since 2002 there have been two other global outbreaks of highly-pathogenic coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS and MERS are not identical to SARS-CoV-2 in their genetic structures or clinical manifestations, the recent outbreaks of these viruses may provide insights on the effects of COVID-19 in the context of pregnancy. The literature on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are limited to a handful of case reports and series. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Many of these cases involved severe morbidity including the need for intensive care and cardiorespiratory support. Notably, there were cases of maternal mortality associated with SARS and MERS infection. The only published case-control study showed that pregnant women with SARS experienced worse outcomes than nonpregnant women of similar age. [10] Reports varied with respect to the effects of SARS and MERS on pregnancy outcomes. Spontaneous abortion has been reported among women infected with SARS and MERS in the first trimester.4 As well, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth have been reported in pregnancies affected by SARS and MERS in the second and third trimesters. [4, 9] It is important to note, however, that a number of pregnancies had good outcomes despite maternal infection with SARS or MERS. [6, 7, 8] Broadly speaking, and drawing upon our knowledge of other respiratory illnesses in pregnancy, adverse It remains to be seen whether the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses will be similar to those of SARS and MERS. To date, the reported case-fatality rate for the general population infected with COVID-19 is lower than that of either SARS or MERS (estimated at 1%-2% vs. 9%-10% and 35%-40%, respectively). Similarly, by now, there have been over 60 cases of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in China and the vast majority of these women have had mild to moderate pneumonia. [11, 12, 13, 14] To date here has been one case of severe maternal morbidity secondary to COVID-19 reported. [12] This 31-year-old woman was infected at 34 weeks gestation and went on to experience severe respiratory compromise and multi-organ dysfunction requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The pregnancy outcomes of the reported cases have been largely good, [11, 12, 13] with spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour being the most commonly reported adverse pregnancy outcomes. One stillbirth has been reported and this occurred in the case of severe maternal illness reported by Liu et al. [12] Given the limited data, it is too early to determine if higher rates of adverse outcomes are expected in pregnant women infected with COVID-19. As with SARS and MERS, pregnancy outcomes are likely to be strongly correlated with degree of maternal illness. [12] There has been no evidence of vertical (mother-to-infant) transmission found in any cases of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Additionally, analyses of amniotic fluid, serum, placenta, and breastmilk from pregnant women confirmed to have SARS or COVID-19 infection have found no detectable viral RNA, [8, 13] further supporting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Importantly, maternal infection with SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 has not been associated with teratogenicity. However, because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester (when embryogenesis occurs), risk of congenital anomaly associated with COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded.",24.92492203156891,8.779833102069894

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2, which have been responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2002 to 2004 and for the more recent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, respectively, interface with the RAAS through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme that physiologically counters RAAS activation but also functions as a receptor for both SARS viruses. 1, 2 The interaction between the SARS viruses and ACE2 has been proposed as a potential factor in their infectivity, 3, 4 and there are concerns about the use of RAAS inhibitors that may alter ACE2 and whether variation in ACE2 expression may be in part responsible for disease virulence in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. [5] [6] [7] [8] Indeed, some media sources and health systems have recently called for the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), both prophylactically and in the context of suspected Covid-19. Given the common use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs in patients with Covid-19 is urgently needed. Here, we highlight that the data in humans are too limited to support or refute these hypotheses and concerns. Specifically, we discuss the uncertain effects of RAAS blockers on ACE2 levels and activity in humans, and we propose an alternative hypothesis that ACE2 may be beneficial rather than harmful in patients with lung injury. We also explicitly raise the concern that withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors may be harmful in certain high-risk patients with known or suspected Covid-19.",27.970265254966908,11.467579884288083

Unfortunately, multiple studies have shown that patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension and coronary artery disease, are more likely to suffer from a severe COVID-19 infection that requires ICU care, have complications like ARDS, which in turn may result in death [27] [28] [29] 32, 40] . One study showed that patients infected with COVID-19 who had underlying hypertension had increased odds of death (OR 3.05 [95% CI 1.57-5.92, p b .001]) compared to those without hypertension. Similarly, coronary artery disease was associated with increased odds (OR 21.4 [95% CI 4.64-98.7, p b .0001]) of death [40] . In one meta-analysis, COVID-19 patients with hypertension had a relative risk ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.54-2.68, p b .00001) of having severe disease/ requiring ICU care compared to those without hypertension.

When analyzing the largest case series to date (44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases), the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that patients with cardiovascular disease had a case fatality rate of 10.5% and those with hypertension had a case fatality rate of 6%, both of which were higher than the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% [39] (Fig. 2) .

Patients with cardiovascular disease made up 4.2% of the COVID-19 cases, but were responsible for 18.3% of the COVID-19 deaths ( [42] , Fig. 2 ). This may be due to the fact that patients with history of coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes may have reduced or impaired cardiovascular functional reserve, and the COVID-19 infection may either precipitate a myocardial infarction (type 1 myocardial infarction), increase myocardial demand leading to worsening ischemia and necrosis (type 2 myocardial infarction), or increase metabolic demand that leads to heart failure and death [43] .",30.69059598495246,10.629960128837707

When no or few cases of disease have been reported in a country, laboratory testing is restricted to travellers presenting with an acute respiratory syndrome and coming from regions or countries with widespread transmission. When contact tracing efforts are implemented, criteria for laboratory testing often include symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases or asymptomatic contacts during or after quarantine. After local transmission is established, some countries, such as South Korea, have chosen to test all individuals who have acute respiratory syndrome or who have had contact with a confirmed case. 3 Because of limited testing capacity, other countries, such as Italy or Spain, have restricted laboratory testing to those seeking hospital care for severe COVID symptoms or to those prone to severe disease (the elderly and patients with comorbidities). 4 Thus, curves based on confirmed cases in countries that have been changing the testing recommendations and are now using stringent testing criteria could provide a false impression of flattening (or unmask much steeper curves), which could lead to misinterpretation of the status of the epidemic. By contrast, and as a basic epidemiological concept, comparisons of the number of COVID-19 cases by country or region should be adjusted by the size of the population at risk, using incidence risks (ie, new cases in a population at risk within a specified period of time, also called attack rates in the context of an epidemic). Similarly, mortality is better expressed as mortality risk (ie, number of deaths in a specific time interval divided by population size among which deaths occurred, commonly referred to as mortality rate; figure) and, if possible, should be stratified by age, given the differences in age-specific mortality rates for COVID-19 5,6 and the differential age structure by country. When the epidemic is contained and all cases are identified and contacts traced, absolute number of cases would still be an acceptable indicator if testing criteria have not changed. However, the capacity of countries to detect imported cases varies but is generally poor, estimated to be around 38% at the global level. 7 Thus, the crucial question is how to monitor disease burden when local transmission is widespread and a large proportion of the population has been quarantined or confined at home. We believe that the basic principle is to try to select an indicator that includes the numerator that is least affected by changing testing criteria and that is adjusted by population size. In regions with strong hospital admission or mortality surveillance systems, such an indicator could be the incidence risk of hospital admissions of laboratory-confirmed cases and COVID-19 mortality rates, which should provide a reliable picture of the epidemic, with the following assumptions: (1) most people with severe disease are admitted to hospital and are tested for SARS-CoV-2;",28.61040528832498,11.03856058445094

SARS and MERS HCoV are the most aggressive strains of coronaviruses, leaving about 800 deaths each. SARS HCoV has a 10% mortality rate, while MERS HCoV has a 36% mortality rate, according to the WHO [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

Patients at older age and with medical comorbidities are at the most risk of requiring hospitalization, ICU care, and at risk for death. In one of the largest epidemiologic studies to date from China with widescale testing, 81% of all infected may have mild symptoms (fever, cough, malaise), 19% required hospitalization, and 5% required critical care; with an overall case-mortality rate of 2.3%.

Early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quarantine and isolation strategies of patients with COVID-19 can significantly prevent and control the transmission of the virus. By appropriately identifying the infected individuals and minimizing the transmission of the virus in the community, it is possible to effectively control the spread of infection. The early clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lack specificity, and its etiology is difficult to identify through computed tomography scans. Therefore, the handbook guide [1] suggests that the gold standard of diagnosing COVID-19 is real-time fluorescence-based real-time isolation rooms and install air purification systems. Therefore, our hospital designed and set up a special room under negative pressure for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with an air change rate of 12 times per hour. To prevent close contact between suspected cases and the sampling collector, a transparent acrylic board with two openings for sampling was set up to separate the two areas for them ( Figure 1 ). The room was installed with air disinfectors and ultraviolet air purifiers.",26.944109975852786,10.410632574404653

Until today, six different strains of Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported, in addition to the newly emerged COVID-19 [2, 12] . 229E and NL63 strains of HCoVs belong to Alphacoronaviruses while OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 HCoVs belong to Betacoronaviruses [2, 11] . SARS and MERS HCoV are the most aggressive strains of coronaviruses, leaving about 800 deaths each. SARS HCoV has a 10% mortality rate, while MERS HCoV has a 36% mortality rate, according to the WHO [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . HCoVs generally are positive-sense and very long (30,000 bp) single-stranded RNA viruses. Two groups of protein characterize HCoVs; structural, such as Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N) Matrix (M) and Envelope (E), and non-structural proteins such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (nsp12) [11] . RdRp is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. RdRp is targeted in different RNA viruses, including Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Zika Virus (ZIKV), and coronaviruses (CoVs) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The active site of RdRp is highly conserved representing two successive aspartate residues protruding from a beta-turn structure making them surface accessible through the nucleotide channel (free nucleotides can pass through) [25, 26] Several in vitro and clinical trials started in China during the last month with the first approved drug, Favilavir, by the National Medical Products Administration of China is announced yesterday (18 February 2020) in Zhejiang province. Different directly acting antiviral drugs are approved against other viruses, by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), such as Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin against RdRp of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). These drugs are nucleotides derivative competing with physiological nucleotide for RdRp active site [22, 27, 28] . Additionally, a huge number of attempts to develop anti-RdRp compounds are under clinical testing against different viruses. The half-maximal Effective Concentration (EC50) for Ribavirin against COVID-19 is 109.5 μM, while its half-maximum Inhibition Concentration (IC50) against Dengue virus is 8 μM [29, 30] . Sofosbuvir show 4 μM against the Zika virus [31] . Remdesivir shows EC90 of 1.76 μM against COVID-19 in vitro [30] . We focus here in the present study on nucleotide inhibitors due to its strong evidence of inhibiting emerging viral RdRps [11, 16] . We build the COVID-19 RdRp model using homology modeling after sequence comparison to the available structures in the protein data bank [32] . Molecular docking is then performed to test some direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs against COVID-19 RdRp (Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Remidisvir, IDX-184). Additionally, the native nucleotides GTP and UTP, from which IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir are derived, are also tested against COVID-19 RdRp model.

[2] Seven of the 34 operative patients (20¢6%) died of COVID-19 associated complications. This mortality rate is much higher than the reported overall case-fatality rate of 2¢3% in COVID-19 patients without surgery, [9] and also higher than the case-fatality rate of 7¢9% in noncardiac surgical patients without COVID-19 infection who were admitted to multidisciplinary ICU. [20] Furthermore, the average duration from the time of first symptom to death of the 7 non-survivors (8¢7 days, range 4 to 13 days) is apparently shorter than that reported previously. In the report of Huang and colleagues, [5] the median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7.0 days (4.0À8.0) and to ICU admission was 10.5 days (8.0À17.0) and 6 patients (15% of the total of 41 cases studied) did not survive ICU. The study did not report the exact dates of patient death, but it is safe for us to say that the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was longer than 10.5 days and thus longer than that of the non-survivors in our study. In other words, it is highly likely that surgical stress occurred during the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbated disease progression and severity. Currently, no specialized medication is available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and supportive measures remain the mainstay of COVID-19 treatment. Thus, the patient's immune function is a major determinant of the disease severity, and populations with low immune function, such as older people are more vulnerable and have high mortality after COVID-19 infection. [7] Surgery may not only cause immediate impairment immune function, [12] but also induce early systemic inflammatory response. [21] Similar to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, [22] the SARS-CoV infected lung could induce and increase the amount of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, and increase the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. [23, 24] And, the high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines has been reported to be correlated with the severity of illness in patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). [5] Consistent with these findings, the most common laboratory abnormalities in this study were lymphopenia (29 [85¢3%] of 34 patients) and increased hypersensitive C-reactive protein.

At present we do not know if people with MS are at increased risk acquring SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 or developing severe COVID-19. Individuals with MS are not unique in their requirement to be treated with immunosuppressive therapies. We discussed the COVID-19 epidemic with our renal transplant team who informed us that at present they are not taking any specific action about the levels of immunosuppression for their transplant patients during the epidemic. Basic measures are recommended namely: to improve hand and home hygiene, to avoid highrisk travel and unnecessary contacts, to self-isolate if necessary and to reduce contact with the hospital and other medical institutions as much as possible, because they are more likely to be sources of COVID-19. It is business as usual. Nor are they necessarily halting their transplant programme.

Most transplant patients are on triple immunotherapy, compared to pwMS who are on monotherapy and even then, the level of immunosuppression is generally low. Hence, the mortality/morbidity risk to an individual on a DMT, infected with COVID-19, may be actually quite moderate to low. Another hypothesis being considered is that moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with COVID-19 infection. The severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by an over-exuberant immune response to the virus (Ramanathan et al., 2020) . As a result, several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in China and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus. Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxxx (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferon beta is also being trialled in COVID-19 based on its antiviral properties (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276688). Then there is the virology to take into account. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species (Andersen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. As it is a small RNA virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution. Vaccines take time to be developed, tested and introduced at a population level. Delaying treatment, de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory DMTs, such as interferonbeta, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, or interrupting dosing of DMTs to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of MS, especially as it may take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine. We, therefore, need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of COVID-19 in individuals with MS. If patients have active MS they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy DMTs. This should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virus.",27.179179647319355,10.220737845886243

[1] Consequently, we are expecting to find drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 from the experience of SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). Some drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir, and corticosteroids, have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, [2] within the selection range of ""conventional drug in new use"". Through clinical treatment of the COVID- 19 , it has been found that neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir), ganciclovir, acyclovir, ribavirin are ineffectual and not recommended for clinical application. [3] When we set our sights on the broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, we found that a drug unlisted, remdesivir, has demonstrated strength in trials related to MERS-CoV and Ebola virus infection. In the United States, the first patient with COVID-19 has shown significant improvement in clinical symptoms within 24 hours of treatment with remdesivir. This case has convinced the public that remdesivir could become a new ""specific drug"" for COVID-19.

For many of these urgent procedures, such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion, laparoscopy may offer the best surgical approach and outcomes for the patient. However, some have suggested that laparoscopic procedures should be avoided, and laparotomy procedures be universally employed when a patient is COVID-19 positive or status is unknown due to concerns about aerosolization of viral particles via the pneumoperitoneum. We strongly disagree with this premise. Based on best available evidence, we concur with both the recent U.S. joint professional society statement on minimally invasive gynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic (1) as well as the European joint society statements (2) endorsing laparoscopy as a safe surgical approach in this setting.",25.942544502366253,10.592296311082475

When our treatments are accompanied by good quality evidence, we have good estimates of benefit and can consent with access to data on likely acute and long-term harms. The risk benefit ratio of treatment changes in the context of a pandemic. If the likelihood of serious infection increases or the likelihood of the outcome of that infection being more serious increases, then the risk may start to outweigh the benefit. Estimating the harms of COVID infection for cancer patients is currently difficult because there have been too few reported events for modelling. A simple model could use the risk of COVID infection multiplied by risk of serious morbidity/mortality. If a patient has a 5% risk of infection and 10% risk of death from infection there may be a 0.5% mortality through exposure and attendance for radiotherapy. If the patient is young and healthy with a 5% risk of infection and 1% risk of death, then there is 0.05% mortality from COVID-19.

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",30.40053419625718,9.172118899470423

The result is a relatively easily transmitted virus with a case fatality rate currently estimated as well above that of the seasonal influenza. With its high transmissibility and rapid global circulation, COVID-19 is being compared with the deadly Spanish flu outbreak of 1918. 1 On 30 January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. Since erupting in China, it has claimed thousands of lives there, and has now spread globally, causing infections, death and growing alarm. The WHO's initial focus was on managing droplet and contact transmission, but it has since recognized the role fomites play as well. 2 Fomites are important because while populations generally protect themselves from clearly observable droplet transmissions (coughing, sneezing), being invisible, fomite transmission is regularly overlooked both in hospitals and communities. 3e5 Consequently, during the community saturation phase, fomite transmission may play a larger role than droplet transmission as a mechanism in emergent infectious diseases. 3e6 In this paper we argue that by implementing enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB), 6 an extension of the TCB deployed by Taiwan during the 2003 SARS outbreak, countries can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19's impact.",26.602142607832455,8.548123859348472

Thus far, no complications related to the steroids have been recorded in the mothers and infants, but their safety still needs more data to draw conclusions. Because of alterations in hormone levels and decreased lung volumes caused by increases in uterus size during pregnancy, patients might have a more rapid clinical deterioration. Additionally, the influence of the virus itself and these antivirals and Chinese medicines on fetal development is unknown. Therefore, for full-term pregnant women, after consultation with a multi disciplinary team, delivering as soon as possible might be a better choice for the sake of safety considerations. Timely use of antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infections and strengthen immune support treatment can reduce complications and mortality, so antibiotics were used routinely after operation. 15 COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy is a complicated clinical scenario, and a multidisciplinary team of medical personnel is needed to care for and treat these patients comprehensively. Relevant specialty areas include obstetrics, infectious diseases, internal medicine, paediatrics, anaesthesia, psychology, and infection control.

Other reasons should be considered and explored based on future data. In addition, the higher rates of familial clustering may be related to faecal shedding in shared toilets in households. Further multivariate analysis revealed sputum production from infected areas and increased LDH/glucose levels as independent risk factors for the disease. In addition, symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath and headache were also significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, which may be caused by their higher fevers and increased electrolyte imbalance. Liver damage should be carefully monitored, as we found significantly increased AST levels and coexisting conditions of liver disease in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms.

This concurs with pre-print studies that found similarly high mortality rates (35, (44) (45) (46) (47) . Despite the small number of patients that were analysed, this increases concerns about the prognosis of this vulnerable population. However, this high mortality rate could be attributed to several factors. The majority of COPD patients have various comorbidities that may also be associated with mortality and related conditions may have been underreported because of the difficulties finding the specific cause of mortality (48) . Moreover, in patients with severe COPD, respiratory failure is the principal cause of mortality and this demands ICU intervention. It is possible that limited access to respiratory support as part of COVID-19 management may be contributing to this mortality, dependent on critical care capacity in each hospital or region. According to a recent COVID-19 report from Italy, the surge in patients requiring intensive care has been unmanageable, with 12% of positive cases requiring ICU admission (49) , more than that reported in China (18, 28). As a consequence, patients were dying because mechanical ventilation could not be offered, on top of acute shortage of clinicians who were able to manage those patients (50, 51) .

However, COVID-19 is spreading in different rates at different countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic, climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID-19. We found that global connections, represented by countries' importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics did not affect this big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize almost every corner on Earth. Based on our global analysis, the global network of air transportation could lead to a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic if board control measures in international airports were not taken and are not sustained during this pandemic. Despite all limitations of a global analysis, our results indicate that the current claims that the growth rate of COVID-19 may be lower in tropical countries should be taken very carefully, at risk to disturb well-established and effective policy of social isolation that may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to collapse of national health systems. This is the case of Brazil, a well-connected tropical country that presents the second highest increase rate of COVID-19 and might experience a serious case of human-induced disasters if decision makers take into consideration unsupported claims of the growth rate of COVID-19 might be lower in tropical countries.",26.383883455786325,8.676414269494638

In particular, In particular, for influenza the mortality changes less significantly with age in comparison to coronavirus; hence common influenza models do not give much insight in modelling the COVID-19 epidemic. The report [3] , which is widely considered as the main document specifying the current epidemic in the UK and in the world, is almost entirely based on the use of standard epidemiological models and hence the conclusions of [3] seem to be lacking specifics related to important issues of the study such as heterogeneity of development of epidemic at different locations and even flexible use of different death rates across different ages. Moreover, as noted in [4] , the basic assumptions for the model of [3] were written more than 13 years ago and based on the specific dynamics of a flu pandemic and hence the model was not calibrated for COVID-19. Unreliability of COVID-19 data, including the numbers of COVID cases and COVID deaths, is a serious problem. It is discussed, in particular, by G. Antes, in [5] .",13.720256383555284,4.303362365680936
