In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",33.18270308669315,9.988412860170675

The disease is named due to the similarities to the SARS outbreak in China of 2002, which was also caused by a coronavirus. However, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be caused by a novel coronavirus not seen before. Alongside uncertainty related to infection aetiology and outcomes, emerging concerns relate to the use of common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. The Belgian Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products released a statement on 16th March 2020 stating 'It is well known that NSAIDs and corticosteroids can lead to serious complications'. Equally, a report by French Authorities suggested the use of ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients was detrimental to patient condition and recovery.

This is an excellent example of how a high-quality clinical study can make a major difference in policy setting. Several important clinical features of COVID-19 have also been documented in this study. First, an attack rate of 83% within the family context is alarmingly high, indicating the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Second, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in this family range from mild to moderate, with more systematic symptoms and more severe radiological abnormalities seen in older patients. Generally, COVID-19 appears to be less severe than SARS. Third, an asymptomatic child was found to have ground-glass opacities in his lung and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in his sputum sample. This finding of asymptomatic virus shedding raises the possibility for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic carriers to others, which is later confirmed by others [2] . Finally, the presentation of diarrhea in two young adults from the same family also suggests the possibility for gastrointestinal involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection and fecal-oral transmission. The study has set the stage for the control and management of COVID-19 [1] .

COVID-19 is a self-limiting disease in more than 80% of patients. Severe pneumonia occurred in about 15% of cases as revealed in studies with large cohorts of patients. The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon α2b, interferon β, chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon α2b and interferon β are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",26.098079891905762,9.590682662195912

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",29.102497679303703,8.538878691006419

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",26.069460505153923,8.337090575438904

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers have been converted into 'Fang Cang' (temporary quarantine hospital facilities) for infected patients with mild symptoms [14] (Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for psychiatric hospitals in China to safely manage patients' major psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19.

This finding is in line with the results of a previous study on SARS-CoV-1 that was done by Wong and colleagues (15) .

Furthermore, the limited cancer patient population described in this first report from the literature, was curiously characterized by the lack of individuals receiving anticancer immunotherapy. Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [7] . Cancer patients undergoing treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) currently used in everyday practice to treat solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, renal carcinoma, urothelial cancers and head and neck carcinoma constitute a growing oncological population [8] . Their specific susceptibility to bacterial or viral infections has not been investigated. Considering that immunotherapy with ICI is able to restore the cellular immunocompetence, as we previously suggested in the context of influenza infection, the patient undergoing immune checkpoint blockade could be more immunocompetent than cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy [9, 10] .",30.55920912631247,9.6407874155319

Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) is a phenomenon of immune hyperactivation typically described in the setting of T cell-engaging immunotherapy, including CAR-T cell therapy but also anti-PD-1 agents [15] . CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] . Moreover, the pathological findings associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 showed abundant interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, dominated by lymphocytes, once again implying that the immune hyperactivation mechanisms are at least partially accountable for COVID-19 severity [17] .

Among such individuals, cancer patients represent a large subgroup at high risk of developing coronavirus infection and its severe complications. A recent nationwide analysis in China demonstrated that, of 1590 COVID-19 cases from 575 hospitals, 18 had a history of cancer (1 vs 0.29% of cancer incidence in the overall Chinese population, respectively), with lung cancer as the most frequent diagnosis [5] . Patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events compared with patients without cancer (39 vs 8%; p = 0.0003). Moreover, cancer patients who underwent recent chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of clinically severe events than did those not receiving treatment. With the limit of a small sample size, the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of COVID-19, and poorer outcomes, than individuals without cancer.

Numerous studies have been published, establishing evidence and opinion-based guides for emergency physicians, who are at the front line. Although many have established pathways for dealing with patient screening, testing, prognosis and disposition, I would like to discuss the management of the crashing patients in need of ventilation who we ought to be prepared for the most. As of now, it is essential to contain a crashing suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient within the confines of a negative isolation chamber due to a high risk of aerosolization, with strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE), exclusively comprising of N95 or preferably a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) (1). Most experienced staff should look after the patient, in order to minimize contamination to few personnel only. Since conventional methods of Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) are inadvisable due to aerosol generation, it is suggested to secure a definitive airway with extreme precaution (2) . Pre-oxygenation can be performed with a Bag Valve Mask device with positive end expiratory valve and a viral filter, if available. It is recommended to form a good facemask seal with both hands, while making sure not to deliver any positive breaths (2) . Induction and relaxant medications should be administered at a maximum dose in order to prevent cough or gag reflex during the procedure (3). A video laryngoscope should be used so as to avoid having the operator position their face close to the patient. The most senior physician should at-tempt maintaining the airway, in order to maximally ensure first pass intubation success; however, in a failed airway scenario, attempts should be made to establish a surgical airway immediately. The endotracheal tube (ETT) should be positioned at a predetermined depth and secured properly. Avoid auscultation attempts to prevent instrument contamination, and look for bilateral chest rise or end tidal capnography waveform. If available, a viral filter should be connected to the adapter of the ETT, and another should be placed at the exhalation port of the ventilator (2) . A plastic transparent sheet can be placed over the patientâȂŹs head and chest to prevent droplet spread (4). All contaminated instruments should be placed in a transparent bag for immediate disposal and/or decontamination. The ARDSnet (acute respiratory distress syndrome network) protocol should be followed for patient ventilation. In case of poor PaO2/FiO2(PF) ratio (<150), place the patient in prone position (5) . Allow for permissive hypercapnia (pH > 7.2), if hemodynamics remain stable (6, 7) . Do not give fluid boluses and maintain the patient in negative balance (8) . If needed, place a central venous access line in femoral site for administering vasopressors to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure. Following intubation and initial ventilation, immediately proceed to transfer the patient to intensive care unit, after which, perform decontamination of the initial zone and the equipment used.

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",32.659093332300245,11.694792636189241

On the 7 th January, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified and isolated this novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between persons via close contacts [2] leading to COVID-19. Infected patients may develop severe and even fatal respiratory diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure) ending up in intensive care [2, 3] . Due to potentially serious health outcomes brought by COVID-19, from 23 rd January, 2020, Wuhan and other regions in China have adopted strict quarantine measures to prevent and control the disease epidemic [4, 5] .

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test.

First, several online mental health services have been constructed across different areas, however, unified national management and coordination policies are still inadequate, which could result in uneven distribution and wastage of medical resources, let alone evaluating the efficacy of these services. Second, online mental health services are the predominant assistance measure and therefore, some people (e.g., older adults) who may have limited access to smartphones and the broadband internet, may benefit less from the services [42] . Third, frontline health professionals may have limited time and energy to access to these services due to heavy workload. Fourth, based on experiences of SARS outbreak, some patients and health professionals would be traumatized by the COVID-2019 outbreak and still suffer from persistent psychiatric symptoms even after the outbreak [43] . Thus, the COVID-19 epidemic has become an extra socio-economic burden on existing mental health service provision in China.

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare.

Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available. However, at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected, to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years, too. There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months.

However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel.

The only estimate of the rate of spread of the virus to date has been in the scientific work of Li et al. from the 29 th of January [23] . However, it was difficult to subsequently determine R0 parameter on the first 425 patients in Wuhan. The estimate of the R0 for COVID-19 in their article was 2.2, but with a very wide confidence interval -from 1.4 to 3.9. It is a bit of tough luck for the Italians, again, that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 1.4 exactly. This figure is well known to all epidemiologists, it' s the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community. It should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that, with more data, R0 for COVID-19 would start converging more towards 1.4. Unfortunately, the more recent data suggests that R0 is more likely to lean towards 3.9, implying an incredibly fast spread.

The new virus is thought to have originated from an animal-to-human spillover event linked to seafood and live-animal markets. The infection has spread locally in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated on Jan 23, 2020. More than 500 patients infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China have been reported between Jan 1 and Feb 14, 2020. Although laboratory testing for COVID-19 quickly ramped up in China and elsewhere, information on individual patients remains scarce and official datasets have not been made publicly available. Patient-level information is important to estimate key time-to-delay events (such as the incubation period and interval between symptom onset and visit to a hospital), analyse the age profile of infected patients, reconstruct epidemic curves by onset dates, and infer transmission parameters.

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) .

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",28.872365692211282,10.45279972184681

Current evidence suggests that the virus originated from wild animals and birds (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/) [2] . To date, more than 2,800 deaths and 87,000 confirmed positive cases have been reported around the world, making COVID-19 a major health concern. As a first line of treatment, along with the antiviral drugs, clinicians are using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the S1 domain of the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein [1] . Very recently (25 January 2020) the first and complete genome sequence of COVID-19 was deposited in the NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3) providing the key to the likely structure and glycosylation pattern of the viral proteins and consequent mode of interaction with the host cell. Similar to most other coronaviruses, the outer membrane spike glycoprotein, known for its glycosylation [3] , is the prime host interacting protein with host cell targets (such as ACE2, CD26, Ezrin, cyclophilins and other cell adhesion factors) important for cell adhesion and virulence [4, 5] . However, the specific host cell factors or proteins that facilitate the novel COVID-19 remain elusive. The current study was thus undertaken to predict the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein structure and glycan shield pattern that has great implications for understanding the viral camouflage and mode of cell entry, potentially assisting the development of new vaccines, antibodies, small-molecule drugs and screening of the human host targets.",29.364436499067892,9.227760582169951

Interestingly our docked model supports this despite the variability between these spike proteins' S1 domains, with the same CD26 residues in close proximity to the active region of S1 domain in COVID-19. We also observed additional residues (Q286, I287, N338, V341, R336) of CD26 predicted to interact with the S1 domain of the spike protein via van der Waals or by hydrogen bonding. However, regarding the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we noticed many different and unique residues (R408, Q409, T445, V417, L461, D467, S469, L491, N492, D493, Y 494, T497, T150, Y504) predicted to interact with CD26. Some of these unique residues of S1 domain are also predicted interact with the ACE2 protein [6] .

This model was validated using the C-Score (confidence score) and TM score (structural similarity) ( Figure S2 ) demonstrating the most correct fold and confidence of the predicted structure. Further validation and refinement was completed by ensuring that the residues occupied Ramachandran favoured positions using Coot (www.mrcimb.cam.uk/) ( Figure S2 ).

Firstly, COVID-19 is a novel disease just recently recognised. The first version of a guideline for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 was announced on 16 January 2020. It took time for the medical professionals to learn about the virus and the disease in order to make correct diagnosis. Secondly, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires two independent confirmatory laboratory tests, which should be taken at least 1 day apart. Our results showed that the lag correlation is shorter for the suspected than for laboratory-confirmed cases.

Considering the current public health crisis, we considered the potential molecular interactions between COVID-19 spike protein and human CD26, with an interest to explore the structural differences or similarities between SARS-CoV and COVID-19 spike protein interactions. To this end, a computational model based selective docking was performed using the server Cluspro protein-protein docking (Www.cluspro.bu.edu) and Frodock (http://frodock.chaconlab. org/) for further validation using our modelled 3D homotrimer structure of COVID-19 Spike glycoprotein ( Figure 2 ) and the human CD26 (PDB: 4QZV) [10] .

As online CBT does not require the presence of mental health professionals (e.g., psychologists), this will be helpful to the general public in China as there is a shortage of psychologists. Based on our findings, cognitive therapy can provide information or evidence to enhance confidence in the doctor's ability to diagnose COVID-19. Cognitive therapy can challenge cognitive bias when recipients overestimate the risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19. As the majority of the general population in this study was homebound for 20-24 h per day during the epidemic, behavior therapy could focus on relaxation exercises to counteract anxiety and activity scheduling (e.g., home-based exercise and entertainment) to counteract depression in the home environment. Self-administered acupressure and emotional freedom techniques derived from key principles within traditional Chinese medicine are potential interventions which may benefit the mental health of general public during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Given the limited resources available and time-sensitivity of the COVID-19 outbreak, we adopted the snowball sampling strategy. The snowballing sampling strategy was not based on a random selection of the sample, and the study population did not reflect the actual pattern of the general population. Furthermore, it would be ideal to conduct a prospective study on the same group of participants after a period. Due to ethical requirements on anonymity and confidentiality, we were not allowed to collect contact details and personal information from the respondents. As a result, we could not conduct a prospective study that would provide a concrete finding to support the need for a focused public health initiative. There was an oversampling of a particular network of peers (e.g., students), leading to selection bias. As a result, the conclusion was less generalizable to the entire population, particularly less educated people. Another limitation is that self-reported levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression and stress may not always be aligned with assessment by mental health professionals. Similarly, respondents might have provided socially desirable responses in terms of the satisfaction with the health information received and precautionary measures. Lastly, the number of respondents with contact history and who had sought medical consultations was very small. Our findings could not be generalized to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. Notwithstanding the above limitations, this study provides invaluable information on the initial psychological responses 2 weeks after the outbreak of COVID-19 from respondents across 194 cities in China. Our results could be used as a historical reference. Most importantly, our findings directly inform the development of psychological interventions that can minimize psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the outbreak of COVID-19 and provide a baseline for evaluating prevention, control, and treatment efforts throughout the remainder of the COVID-19 epidemic, which is still ongoing at the time of preparing this manuscript.",26.065249165995866,6.861142878121516

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",28.10630645642715,9.690157966082424

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed.

They belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and can cause severe respiratory disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory failure. 2 Tracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation is the mainstay therapy to correct hypoxaemia. Preoxygenation with the standard bag-valve mask oxygenation followed by rapid-sequence intubation has been proposed in non-severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation to reduce the risk of aspiration and desaturation. However, a previous study reported that 23% of patients had SpO 2 <90% during intubation. 3 Thus far, more than 80000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China.

However, other common early-stage cancers (breast, prostate, cervical, nonmelanoma skin) may not. The quality of evidence in some cases is inadequate to support ""one size fits all"" statements applicable to every patient.

The economic fall-out from COVID-19 appears to be profound, at least $20 trillion in a few short weeks, and may exceed the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The direct costs of COVID-19 travel bans, social distancing, and other responses are merely one aspect. Far more devastating is the uncertainty that has gripped capital markets. Declining economic activity and large drops in capital markets have a mutually reinforcing impact, undermining the capacity of heavily indebted businesses and households to cover their debts. Uncertainty is the primary driver of such crises, and stems in large measure from lack of close coordination and science-based decision-making. Were there more certainty, households, investors and other economic agents would be less inclined to panic. COVID-19 appears certain to become a very costly lesson that DRR does indeed save many more multiples in avoided costs than its initial investment. An additional point in this regard is that health is a critical infrastructure. The resilience of critical infrastructure is well identified in DRR literature (e.g. [18, 19] ). Resilience is fostered not just by sciencebased decisions and coordination, but also via redundancy to ensure buffer capacity when a particular system collapses [20] .

The arrangement of nucleocapsid protein (N), envelope protein(E), and membrane protein (M) among betacoronaviruses are different as depicted in Fig. 3. 9 The role of replication process in pathogenicity SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) binds to ACE2 (the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2) by its Spike and allows COVID-19 to enter and infect cells. In order for the virus to complete entry into the cell following this initial process, the spike protein has to be primed by an enzyme called a protease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) uses a protease called TMPRSS2 to complete this process. 10, 11 In order to attach virus receptor (spike protein) to its cellular ligand (ACE2), activation by TMPRSS2 as a protease is needed (Fig. 4) . 10 After the virus enters the host cell and uncoats, the genome is transcribed and then translated. Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicate, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene. 12 The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins. Besides RNAdependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3 0 -to-5 0 exoribonuclease, 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1 0 -phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic Genotype and phenotype of COVID- 19 3 phosphodiesterase activities. 13, 14 The proteins are assembled at the cell membrane and genomic RNA is incorporated as the mature particle forms by budding from the internal cell membranes. 15",27.807345779085615,11.175426258614221

Several abnormalities also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection. 16 In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation have been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3",30.239563905812247,9.838208364711136

Radiotherapy is delivered to nearly 50% of cancer patients, a particularly vulnerable group given their older age, frequent comorbidities, and underlying cancer diagnosis. 2 Prostate cancer is frequently treated with radiation and the most common solid tumor in men; it is a heterogeneous disease where timely therapy is indicated for some cases, and where watchful waiting, active surveillance, or deferral of treatment could be acceptable for others. 3, 4 Given the current epidemic crisis, delaying radiotherapy treatment (which requires multiple visits to healthcare facilities) for prostate cancer patients may potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic exposure to COVID-19. At the healthcare system level, when clinically appropriate, reducing visits conserves limited hospital resources (e.g. personal protective equipment (PPE)) for use by health-care workers who will have to care for the potentially vast number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The decision to delay life-saving cancer treatment in a time of a resource-intensive pandemic represents a clinical conundrum without modern precedent. In these exigent circumstances, guidelines as to how to manage patients who present with prostate cancer would be valuable for the practicing clinician.

Summary,"The effective cure rate of QPD against COVID-19 is over 90 %. According to the theory of TCM, the target organ location of COVID-19 is the lung, and the etiology attribute is ""damp and toxin plague"". The network pharmacology analysis showed that QPD has an overall regulatory effect via multi-component and multi-target. The primary site of pharmacological action is the lung, as 16 herbs to lung meridian, which indicated that the decoction is mainly specific for lung diseases. In addition, it can play the role of dehumidification through the rise and fall of the spleen and stomach, and exhibited the protection for heart, kidney and other organs. Among the potential targets screen, most of them co-expressed with ACE-2, the receptor of COVID-19, indicating the potential improvement of COVID-19. It can inhibit the replication of COVID-19 by acting on multiple ribosomal proteins. COVID-19 can lead to strong immune response and inflammatory storm [4] . Functional enrichment analysis showed that QPD could inhibit and alleviate excessive immune response and eliminate inflammation by regulating immune related pathway and cytokine action related pathway [5] . Furthermore, through the prediction of molecular docking, it was found that patchouli alcohol, ergosterol and shionone in the formula had better anti−COVID-19 effect, which provided new molecule structures for new drug development [6] .",25.828044342746264,7.841762699397875

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members.

Efforts have been made to search for a reservoir host or intermediate carriers from which the infection may have spread to humans. Initial reports identified two species of snakes that could be a possible reservoir of the COVID-19. However, to date, there has been no consistent evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds [10, 18] . Genomic sequence analysis of COVID-19 showed 88% identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [19, 20] , indicating that mammals are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans. Several reports have suggested that person-to-person transmission is a likely route for spreading COVID-19 infection. This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan [13, 21] . Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth.

This hypothesis has led some European countries to produce initial policies relying on decreased transmission rates during the summer months, 3 and the belief that African countries will face smaller epidemics than their European counterparts. However, no strong evidence base exists for such claims; SARS-CoV-2 might have simply arrived later to warmer countries. We used data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Baltimore, MD, USA) to plot the cumulative number of cases since the diagnosis of both the first patient and the first five patients by country, both in Europe and Africa (figure). Although the first confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred later in west Africa than in Europe, once these first cases were confirmed in west Africa, the expansion in the number of confirmed COVID-19 was rapid. Of particular concern are Burkina Faso and Senegal, which saw sharp increases in the number of cases soon after the initial cases were confirmed in these countries. Cases in both countries might evolve in a similar way to what was observed in European countries with the most expansive epidemics (ie, Italy and Spain, where SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly after case number five was detected).

Remdesivir is being developed by Gilead as a monophosphoramidate prodrug: GS-441524. It was intended to be an intravenous treatment for Ebola but it also shows potential against coronavirus and Nipah virus infection. The results from evaluating the antiviral efficiency of remdesivir against a clinical isolate of COVID-19 in vitro suggest that it could inhibit COVID-19 strongly with an EC50 ranging from 0.77 to 1.76 μM [3] . Remdesivir cured the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the USA, which prompted Gilead and the Chinese authorities to move the Phase III trial ahead and expand it to a lot more patients who desperately need treatment. Final results of the clinical trial will be announced in April 2020. In contrast to remdesivir, the activity report of favipiravir in vitro and in vivo is limited. However, there are still three active clinical trials regarding favipiravir that have begun enrolling patients in China. Lopinavir and ritonavir, targeting 3Clpro, were used to treat SARS patients from China in 2003. Shortly after the emergence of MERS-CoV, researchers identified lopinavir and ritonavir as MERS-CoV inhibitors. The national expert group has recommended lopinavir and ritonavir as effective anti-COVID-19 agents in China, and most clinical trials on COVID-19 select both drugs as positive controls. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Currently, only one trial combines emtricitabine/tenofoviralafenamide and lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19 patients. Arbidol as a 2′-5′oligoadenylates synthesis (OAS) inhibitor against severe pneumonia and virusassociated cytokine dysregulation has displayed anti-COVID-19 potential in clinical trials [4] . However, the mechanism needs to be clarified in the near future. Chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have elicited antiviral effects on several viruses such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E by interfering with endosomal acidification. Based on the advantage of known broadspectrum activity and rarely occurring adverse reactions, a series of clinical trials on chloroquine and its derivatives have been advancing rapidly. Presently, Chinese government authorities have approved chloroquine phosphate to be used to treat adult patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Further, treatments combining Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and chemical molecules (popularly known as Western medicine in China) have shown some exciting results. In view of inconclusive clinical evidence on TCM efficacy, pharmacologists should separate active pharmaceutical ingredients and identify explicit targets as soon as possible [5] . Surprisingly, various drugs are also in clinical trials despite the lack of biological rationale, such as the antiinfluenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir targeting neuraminidase, baloxavirmarboxil targeting cap-dependent endonuclease that is not found in COVID-19, ASC09 targeting protease with no anti-coronavirus research reported, and cobicistat targeting CYP3A4 with only unpersuasive predicted activity by computer virtual docking. As the crystal structures of COVID-19 spike [6] , dimeric full-length human ACE2 [7] and COVID-19 spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ACE2 receptor [8] are published in succession, the lead drug discovery strategy such as structure-based HTS and molecular dynamics simulation to discover inhibitors with affinity to ACE2, the S protein or the protein-protein interaction will be possible in the near future. There have been three major outbreaks of coronaviruses in the 21st century: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19. Drawing experience from effective screening strategies on antitumor drug development, the credible and large-scale screening system of the especially deadly coronaviruses must be set up at the molecular level and in animal models as soon as possible. Although the clinical safety of old drugs has been proven, some of them can cause serious adverse reactions. For example, hydroxychloroquine has the side effect of arrhythmia, which can itself lead to death. Thus, special attention needs to be paid to the safety of old drugs in new indications.",27.566116738524205,11.43653686828629

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement. Also, a staging system based on the severity and organ involvement is needed in COVID-19 in order to rank the patients for aggressive or conventional treatment modalities.

COVID-19, a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified, is similar to the coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV with >79% sequence identity; but it is more distant from MERS-CoV (only 50% homology) [2] . For all coronaviruses including COVID-19, at least three structural proteins are shared on the membrane: spike (S), the membrane protein (M) and small membrane protein (E). Also, another four functional proteins were found in almost all coronaviruses: 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase. During the viral infection process, including intracellular transport of virions, proliferation and assembling of virions in the infected cellnot only structural and functional proteins but also some proteasesplay a key part, suggesting that targeting these proteins or enzymes as a therapy against COVID-19 infection could be a promising strategy. To date, no special drugs or vaccines have been used to deal with human coronaviruses. Considering the seriousness and suddenness of the COVID-19 outbreak, ~200 clinical trials on COVID-19 have commenced in China, and it is promising to report that certain targets and their agents have displayed strong antiviral potential, of which some have been permitted to be used in an attempt to combat the disease in clinical trials.",27.87769891154212,10.068168677548613

Using the ratio of COVID-19 to influenza cases identified in an early retrospective surveillance study in China [3], it was estimated that the actual number of severe pediatric cases and mildly infected children may have been significantly larger (by a factor of several hundreds and several thousands, respectively) compared to what had been registered suggesting that the force of infection from children may have been grossly underestimated [14] .

Nevertheless, based on the assumption that viral RNA load correlates with high levels of viral replication, 5 there are important insights to be gained from this time-course analysis. Currently, our understanding of the relationship between viral RNA load kinetics and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 remains fragmented. Zou and colleagues reported that patients with COVID-19 with more severe disease requiring intensive care unit admission had high viral RNA loads at 10 days and beyond, after symptom onset. 4 Unfortunately, it is unknown when in the course of their disease these patients deteriorated. By contrast, Lescure and colleagues report the viral RNA kinetics of two patients who developed late respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. It would be interesting to know whether viral RNA load in lung tissue, or a surrogate sample such as tracheal aspirate, mirrors the decline in nasopharyngeal shedding. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that these late, severe manifestations might be immunologically mediated and has obvious implications for the potential to use immune-modulatory therapies for this subset of patients. This finding is consistent with recent reports that corticosteroids were beneficial for acute respiratory distress syndrome, 6 and possibly those with COVID-19. 7 With more detailed data such as those provided by Lescure and colleagues, the use of viral RNA load to suggest potential clinical strategies to treat COVID-19 could be exploited.",23.95390487308338,5.970562728328131

For example, nonpharmacological treatments such as re-positioning in bed or the use of handheld fans may help relieve symptoms, although use of the latter in inpatient settings may be limited due to risk of aerosolizing viral particles. Pharmacological treatments such as judicious use of opioids and benzodiazepines for dyspnea and anxiety, respectively, could be used carefully for patients with respiratory failure. COVID-19 patients may also experience gastrointestinal, olfactory and hypogeusia/ageusia symptoms for which providers should assess and provide symptom-targeted relief (in the case of gastrointestinal symptoms) or acknowledgement (for changes in smell and taste).

All pharmacy professionals should keep up to date, and be familiar, with the latest CoV prevention and treatment guidelines, which are rapidly changing. 1 Several resources are available to help pharmacists worldwide care for individuals and communities, such as the American Pharmacists' Association (APhA) resource centre webpage, which provides the latest information from federal agencies and a decision-tree document that can be used to assist pharmacists in talking to individuals with different levels of COVID-19 risk. The APhA has also recently issued a tool --Preparedness and Prevention Guidance during Coronavirus Pandemic --to help pharmacists be prepared. 3 For preparing clinicians to respond to health threats and emergencies related to disease outbreaks and disasters, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) is a vital information source. 3 In addition, many reference documents are now being made available to pharmacists so they can have access to the latest updates regarding COVID-19 management. The American Society of Hospital Pharmacists (ASHP) has recently initiated a comprehensive online resource that includes most of the COVID-19-related pharmacy information and free, 60-day open access to ASHP drug information. 4 It should be noted that pharmacists should regularly review these pharmaceutical recommendations because changes are expected as information about the virus accumulates. Below are directions to some of these online resources: patients, they need to pay attention to protecting themselves. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthcare staff wear appropriate eye protection, surgical masks, long-sleeved gowns and gloves when entering a room containing suspected or confirmed COVID-19-infected individuals. WHO has also recommended using a particulate respirator that is at least as protective as a US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified N95 when performing aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation or manual ventilation before intubation or bronchoscopy). 5 However, self-isolation of pharmacists who have been in contact with suspected COVID-19 individuals are not obliged to wear these unless otherwise ordered by health protection professionals. 6",29.05801742287275,10.169603091395187

To limit the virus spread, those in the USA are canceling both smaller (∼100 people) and large meetings, researchers are limiting their travel both overseas and within the country, and student college and graduate school visit weekends are being postponed or stopped altogether. Still, there is much uncertainty about how to proceed and what other measures should be taken. Since the outbreak began in China, Chinese scientists have already faced many of the questions that those of us in other locations are now asking. We therefore asked several Chinese scientists to discuss the strategies that they are pursuing to limit the impact of the virus both on their research and on society. Some of the actions taken by the scientists and the government under this extreme situation may have a long-term influence and shift our future research and funding paradigm. We anticipate that their perspectives will be valuable to the community. global lifethreatening concern in recent days. The war against COVID-19 there has now reached the most critical moment, as confirmed COVID-19 cases have peaked for several days, and almost all the people in Wuhan City have been screened for suspected case identification (as of late February). We cannot imagine how people there are sacrificing to control the spread of COVID-19. As alumni of Wuhan University that is located in the center of Wuhan city, we became deeply saddened and worried as we watched the entire city cope with an unprecedented emergency situation. We wanted to provide a glimpse of what chemical biologists have been working on, from the perspective of scientists in China. In the past 40 days, we have heard more stories of hope and resilience than of worry and grief in China, where 1.4 billion people are doing their best to bring this serious outbreak under control. Right now, the epidemic situation outside Hubei is gradually improving, and the situation inside Hubei has shown signs of stabilization. It is noteworthy that although it is mandated that most people have to stay at home as a quarantine procedure, scientists in China have been increasingly devoted to combating COVID-19, with several clinical trials currently underway. As for scientists throughout the world, researchers in China are making extraordinary efforts toward rapid advancement of diagnostic and treatment approaches, and are doing so under highly challenging personal circumstances with extensive restrictions on not only travel, but day-to-day activities. As mentioned by WHO officers, Chinese scientists have been extremely professional in the face of this epidemic and have made their findings rapidly available to researchers around the world to coordinate global efforts to characterize, treat, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. One team led by Yongzhen Zhang from Fudan University completed the deep sequencing of COVID-19 and made its whole genome sequence publicly available on January 10, 2020. 1 Medical experts, virologists, structural biologists, and medicinal chemists have made significant contributions in areas such as epidemic prevention and control, patient treatment, virus classification and traceability, structure analysis, and clinical drug development. The current progress relied on the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the dedication of scientific researchers. During the epidemic, almost all industries not related to any antiepidemic efforts were halted due to the lock down of transportation and lack of manpower. It has been extremely difficult to complete highlevel scientific research under such an extreme situation.",26.83166801002057,10.072048419657794

It may be necessary to use innovative approaches, such as converting single rooms to double occupancy; expediting discharges; slowing admission rates; and converting spaces like catheterization laboratories, lobbies, postoperative care units, or waiting rooms into patient care venues. For example, at Michigan Medicine, designated beds in critical care units and non-critical care settings for persons under investigation and patients who test positive for COVID-19 have been identified. A dedicated team of hospitalists and critical care providers has been established, with clinical schedules and roles for leadership, communication, and activation criteria.

At the national and international level, travel restrictions have been implemented for regions with the highest COVID-19 incidence currently, but these recommendations and polices are likely to rapidly change and warrant close monitoring. Patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 with recent travel to areas of higher incidence (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy based on the most recent CDC data) should be asked to wear a standard surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be placed in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne isolation room (negative-pressure room). 3, 7 It is important to note that travel history criteria for testing for COVID-19 will change as community-based spread is emerging within the United States and patients living in or with recent travel to areas where COVID-19 has been confirmed should be considered for testing as well. Any concern for possible COVID-19 should immediately prompt notification of institutional infection prevention and control as well as local or state health departments. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions (gown and gloves), airborne precautions (with N95 respirator), and eye protection (goggles or a face shield). Testing has been performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but is now more widely available in state and city laboratories and is becoming available commercially. It is important that more common respiratory illnesses (influenza, etc.) are also ruled out. What should we tell our patients based on our current knowledge? First, this is a rapidly evolving area with new information emerging on a daily basis. Therefore periodically checking on recommendations from leading national and international health organizations, such as the CDC or the World Health Organization (WHO), is the most important way for both patients and physicians to stay informed with accurate information. Second, it is important to realize that the majority of cases (80+%) have been mild, the fatality rate for COVID-19 is lower than prior coronavirus outbreaks, and the proportion of severe/fatal cases may be an overestimate as milder or asymptomatic cases are likely under-reported. 15 Third, there are currently no specific recommendations for people on immunosuppression, such as IBD patients. Prior IBD research has found that viral infections are more likely among patients on immunomodulators (such as 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine) than those on biologics but it is unclear if this can be extended to COVID-19. 16 There are no data currently about the impact of immunosuppressive agents, although one of the largest case series from China did note that 2 patients with immunodeficiency (not further specified) had non-severe disease. 8 17 Last, the best measures to decrease the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 are the same as standard practices against any viral illness. These include good hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizers or soap and water, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing, limiting touching your face, avoiding close contact with anyone with influenza-like and/or upper respiratory symptoms, and staying home if you are sick.",26.629680037375994,10.634083709077881

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases. [7] [8] [9] More recent descriptions of patients in China also noted around 10% of patients were also noted to have elevated total bilirubin levels. 8 Gastroenterologists should be aware of these potential gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.",26.93460403579124,9.401412242965666

General measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection will be of utmost importance for these patients. Depending on the local infrastructure, implementation of COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals is warranted. However, based on the local COVID-19-burden, a sharp separation of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" wards/hospitals may not be sustainable, although recent evidence provides somewhat reassuring data regarding the absence of environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA of inanimate surfaces outside patient rooms. 20 Wherever possible, patients with chronic liver disease requiring inpatient care for non-COVID-19 causes should be admitted to COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals. As these institutions may not be able to provide specialised hepatology-care, similar to our recommendations on outpatient care, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information to facilitate immediate hepatology consultations. However, due to the contagiousness of the virus, patients with underlying liver disease will become infected and will subsequently require inpatient care for COVID-19. With regards to nosocomial-infections, recent observations from Spain that compared patient characteristics between patients with community-acquired influenza and nosocomial-acquired influenza could not detect a significant difference between these cohorts with regards to underlying chronic liver disease. 21 Whether these observations will also hold up in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be proven. Until further evidence emerges, we recommend that patients with chronic liver disease and COVID-19 are admitted for inpatient care if they have additional risk factors for a more severe COVID-19 course like hypertension, diabetes or obesity, cirrhosis, HCC or a posttransplant status.",29.119733548378257,9.354407324567791

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",32.80522111713766,10.596076274722392

COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality. We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households. 5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities. We need to continue to inform, advocate for, and empower local communities and to lobby governments and policymakers to ensure that tuberculosis, as well as COVID-19, remain high on the global agenda. These two pandemics, one old and one new, remind us of the need to be proactive and longsighted, to plan ahead, and to not become complacent.",29.88043730967196,8.579136448895268

The number of affected people will also be a small proportion of the global drug and vaccine market. So by the time a new drug or vaccine is developed, there might not be any patients for clinical trials and also no meaningful market for newly discovered drugs.

[5] [6] [7] It has rapidly spread globally. As of February 18, 72,532 cases were laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed, and 6242 were suspected in China. 8 The reproductive number (R0), defined as the expected number of secondary infectious cases generated by an infectious case in a susceptible population, is estimated to 3.77. 9 Recent publications have depicted the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. 2 , 3 , 7 , 9-11 The definite diagnosis of COVID-19 is expected with the novel coronavirus nucleic acid positive in swabs, sputum, or secretions from the lower respiratory tract, or blood by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). However, the new coronavirus nucleic acid kits are in short supply and time-consuming in manipulation. Furthermore, false negatives may exist in some cases due to the insufficient viral materials in the specimen. Recent studies have reported the cases with initial SARS-CoV-2 negative but typical CT findings, 12 , 13 however, most of them turned out to be positive after repeated tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Therefore, chest CT imaging plays a critical role in the surveillance and diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia with a higher sensitivity and efficiency than the chest X-rays do. Guan et al. also reported that 76.4% cases with viral pneumonia findings at CT were verified COVID-19. 11 Based on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia, patients with typical CT imaging features in Hubei Province will be grouped as clinicallydiagnosed cases, contributing to the total number of confirmed diagnosis according to the ""Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 Pneumonia (Fifth Trial Version)"" released by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China since February 12, 2020. 14 Pregnant women are more susceptible to infectious diseases due to the immune suppression. 15 Previous studies found that there was a male-dominated tendency and few cases occurred in children for COVID-19 pneumonia. 3 , 9 To the best of our knowledge, there are few published data involving the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women and children. 16 , 17 In this present study, the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were investigated for the pregnant women and children in comparison with non-pregnant adults from two centers.

However, 4 of 9 (44%) pregnant COVID-19 patients had premature delivery [5] . In a previous study of MERS-CoV, there were 11 pregnant women [7] . A comparison between MERS-CoV and COVID-19 cases in pregnancy is shown in Table 1 . There was no difference in the age group of the patients, however, the gestational age was lower among MERS-CoV than COVID-19 patients. Of the MERS-CoV cases in pregnancy, 63.6% required intensive care unit admission and this is comparable to 50% of SARS pregnant women [8] . There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] . Thus, similar to the difference in the clinical presentation and course among SARS, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, there is also differences in the outcome and course of pregnant women with these coronaviruses' infection. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and outcome would guide healthcare authorities and public health on further risk mitigation and advise for pregnant women around the world.

Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study reveals that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We find a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship is confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence reveals that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI).

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",30.635916148094708,8.191124254528612

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2, which have been responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2002 to 2004 and for the more recent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, respectively, interface with the RAAS through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme that physiologically counters RAAS activation but also functions as a receptor for both SARS viruses. 1, 2 The interaction between the SARS viruses and ACE2 has been proposed as a potential factor in their infectivity, 3, 4 and there are concerns about the use of RAAS inhibitors that may alter ACE2 and whether variation in ACE2 expression may be in part responsible for disease virulence in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. [5] [6] [7] [8] Indeed, some media sources and health systems have recently called for the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), both prophylactically and in the context of suspected Covid-19. Given the common use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs in patients with Covid-19 is urgently needed. Here, we highlight that the data in humans are too limited to support or refute these hypotheses and concerns. Specifically, we discuss the uncertain effects of RAAS blockers on ACE2 levels and activity in humans, and we propose an alternative hypothesis that ACE2 may be beneficial rather than harmful in patients with lung injury. We also explicitly raise the concern that withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors may be harmful in certain high-risk patients with known or suspected Covid-19.",27.970265254966908,10.206859397349131

One study showed that patients infected with COVID-19 who had underlying hypertension had increased odds of death (OR 3.05 [95% CI 1.57-5.92, p b .001]) compared to those without hypertension. Similarly, coronary artery disease was associated with increased odds (OR 21.4 [95% CI 4.64-98.7, p b .0001]) of death [40] . In one meta-analysis, COVID-19 patients with hypertension had a relative risk ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.54-2.68, p b .00001) of having severe disease/ requiring ICU care compared to those without hypertension.

When analyzing the largest case series to date (44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases), the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that patients with cardiovascular disease had a case fatality rate of 10.5% and those with hypertension had a case fatality rate of 6%, both of which were higher than the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% [39] (Fig. 2) .

Therefore, to facilitate efforts, both in China and glo bally, to prevent and control COVID-19 pneumonia in children and pregnant women, 3 we retrospectively collected and analysed detailed clinical data from pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. In this study we present clinical features of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and examine the vertical trans mission potential of COVID-19. ",29.331452723967644,9.569085581918223

Reportedly, the pregnant woman had developed fever for 8 h and was suspected to have COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of her typical chest CT image before admission; an emergency caesarean section was subsequently done, which was followed by confirmation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, the neonate's throat swab sample was collected approximately 30 h after birth, thus providing no direct evidence for intrauterine infection. Additionally, no direct testing of intrauterine tissue samples such as amniotic fluid, cord blood, or placenta was done to confirm that the COVID-19 infection in the neonate was due to intrauterine transmission.

Early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quarantine and isolation strategies of patients with COVID-19 can significantly prevent and control the transmission of the virus. By appropriately identifying the infected individuals and minimizing the transmission of the virus in the community, it is possible to effectively control the spread of infection. The early clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lack specificity, and its etiology is difficult to identify through computed tomography scans. Therefore, the handbook guide [1] suggests that the gold standard of diagnosing COVID-19 is real-time fluorescence-based real-time isolation rooms and install air purification systems. Therefore, our hospital designed and set up a special room under negative pressure for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with an air change rate of 12 times per hour. To prevent close contact between suspected cases and the sampling collector, a transparent acrylic board with two openings for sampling was set up to separate the two areas for them ( Figure 1 ). The room was installed with air disinfectors and ultraviolet air purifiers.",26.358352078703696,8.429356582758503

As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization.

To date, the epidemic had spread to more than 199 countries and more than 664,941 individuals have contracted the virus worldwide with 30,894 reported deaths, including 37,575 confirmed cases in France and 2,314 deaths [2] . However, these numbers are probably underestimated as not all patients are tested, especially those who are asymptomatic, or with only mild symptoms and no associated comorbidities. The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or sequencing [3] . However, these tests might not be available in an emergency setting and their results are not immediately available. Computed tomography (CT) can be used as an important complement to RT-PCR for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in the current epidemic context [4, 5] . Indeed, when the viral load is insufficient, RT-PCR can be falsely negative while chest CT shows suggestive abnormalities [4, 5] . A large series based on 1014 patients reported a 97% sensitivity of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19, while the mean time interval between initial negative and positive RT-PCR was approximately 5 days [5] . Thus, CT can play a pivotal role in the early detection and management of COVID-19 pneumonia [6] , at least for patients who have been symptomatic for more than three days [4] . Indeed, 56% of patients imaged during the first 2 days following symptom onset may have normal CT findings [7] .",25.18232077211887,6.922078826504574

On average, 0.95 kcal/mol is the difference between the SARS and COVID-19 RdRps' binding energies for these compounds. On the other hand, the difference between COVID-19 and SARS HCoV RdRps' binding energies to IDX-184 and its parent nucleotide GTP are 2.3 and 1.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, all the tested compounds show lower (better) binding energies to COVID-19 RdRp compared to SARS RdRp.

In one report, positive tear and conjunctival secretions occurred in a single patient who developed conjunctivitis from a cohort of thirty patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia [18] . In another report [19] , 64 samples of the tear film from 17 patients with COVID-19 showed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 by viral culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, the frequency of conjunctivitis in patients with COVID-19 reported to date is low, at < 3% [18, 20] , although it has been suggested that CoVs could possibly be transmitted by aerosol contact with the conjunctiva in patients with active disease [18, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

For example, aggressive public health steps to contain the spread of the virus locally may make it relatively safe for a patient to start an immunosuppressive therapy. Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic may trigger a large number of neurologists and patients to reconsider treatment strategy and choice of initial DMT and to opt for less effective immunomodulatory DMTs. This change needs to be considered carefully. The COVID-19 pandemic in all likelihood will be short lived and it would be unfair to patients treated during the epidemic to be disadvantaged in the long term regarding the management of their MS. Neurologists have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort to activate the MS community: to advance the principle that 'time is brain', to treat MS proactively to a target of no evident disease activity (NEDA) and more recently, to flip the pyramid and use higher efficacy treatments first line. These treatment principles are evidence-based and should not be thrown out in the context of a potential, but yet undefined, risk to our patients.",27.204372383140523,8.680752928002724

Most transplant patients are on triple immunotherapy, compared to pwMS who are on monotherapy and even then, the level of immunosuppression is generally low. Hence, the mortality/morbidity risk to an individual on a DMT, infected with COVID-19, may be actually quite moderate to low. Another hypothesis being considered is that moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with COVID-19 infection. The severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by an over-exuberant immune response to the virus (Ramanathan et al., 2020) . As a result, several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in China and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus. Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxxx (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferon beta is also being trialled in COVID-19 based on its antiviral properties (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276688). Then there is the virology to take into account. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species (Andersen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. As it is a small RNA virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution. Vaccines take time to be developed, tested and introduced at a population level. Delaying treatment, de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory DMTs, such as interferonbeta, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, or interrupting dosing of DMTs to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of MS, especially as it may take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine. We, therefore, need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of COVID-19 in individuals with MS. If patients have active MS they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy DMTs. This should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virus.",27.2679812946126,8.668009879278321

The ICU capacity increased up to 65 beds in the same time by mobilizing the three ICUs of our centre, as well as surgery theatres.

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",28.59796911315822,7.139083131580017

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a virus (SARS-CoV-2) from the same family as the lethal coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). COVID-19 is a relatively large virus (120 nm) and is enveloped, containing a positive-sense single-stranded RNA [1]. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with the infected person’s respiratory droplets (coughing and sneezing), as well as contact with infected surfaces. COVID-19 virus can survive for days on surfaces, but a simple disinfectant can eliminate this [2]. COVID-19 signs and symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can lead to pneumonia, serious respiratory problems and ultimately, fatalities. Thousands of people have been reported to have been infected with the virus so far [3]. Apart from China, other cases of the disease, also known as COVID-2, have been reported in several countries, including Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, Iran, and the United States.

Evaluation of the individual residues in this region revealed that the loss of binding was caused by the single F29R mutation (mut6). The single mutation S32N (mut7) also abrogated all Opa binding. The double mutation G41A+Q44R (mut9) clearly diminished Opa binding, but when these mutations were tested individually, a difference between Opa variants was noted. For OpaI interaction, both the G41A and the Q44R mutations were deleterious. This was also the case for interaction with OpaC, although to a lesser extent. The Q44R mutation had a moderate effect on OpaB binding, whereas the G41A change had no effect at all. Mutations in the region between residues 51 and 55 caused only a moderate decrease in Opa binding.

Many professionals in the field of Epidemiology keep talking about the Covid-19 pandemic issues and strongly insisted their opinions to appeal their existence. Many people who do not have related knowledge could only trust what epidemiologists have said [4] [5] . Although professionals have provided historical (scientific) facts which they might learn from the textbook or statistical data, there are a lot of conflictions even within their documented scientific facts. Many data scientists are working for delivering the valuable insights from the Covid-19 data [3, [6] [7] but most of them are spending their efforts for gathering and visualizing data rather than doing theoretical studies to build up a model which could describe the Covid-19 pandemic situations. Basically, the area of Epidemiology is too complicated to provide solid solution based historical facts without having theoretical thinking at the beginning.",14.043315636167813,2.7137947573934604

However, COVID-19 is spreading in different rates at different countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic, climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID-19. We found that global connections, represented by countries' importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics did not affect this big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize almost every corner on Earth. Based on our global analysis, the global network of air transportation could lead to a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic if board control measures in international airports were not taken and are not sustained during this pandemic. Despite all limitations of a global analysis, our results indicate that the current claims that the growth rate of COVID-19 may be lower in tropical countries should be taken very carefully, at risk to disturb well-established and effective policy of social isolation that may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to collapse of national health systems. This is the case of Brazil, a well-connected tropical country that presents the second highest increase rate of COVID-19 and might experience a serious case of human-induced disasters if decision makers take into consideration unsupported claims of the growth rate of COVID-19 might be lower in tropical countries.",14.39724512863589,3.4565091857209937
