Outcomes of a virus infection are shaped by the interplay between various multilayered events of viral-host interactions. Classically, viruses initiate the cycle of infection by attachment of viral surface proteins to specific target cell receptors. Most of the viral surface proteins have extremely immunogenic structures that can bind and stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses (Sahay et al., 2017) . Neutralizing antibodies inhibit virus infection by binding to surface domains essential for virus replication such as the receptor binding site (RBS) and the fusion peptide (Taylor et al., 2015) . In some circumstances, viral-induced antibodies could be detrimental, resulting in enhanced illness such as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE was first reported in 1964 by Hawkes et al. who demonstrated enhanced infectivity of a number of flaviviruses [Murray Valley encephalitis virus, West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)] in the presence of virus-specific antisera, specifically IgG antibodies (Hawkes, 1964) .

In few cases, pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies have shown to increase ADE, while in some experiments such antibodies exhibited therapeutic potential. For instance, preincubation of human myeloid cells (U937), which are poorly permissive for ZIKV, with convalescent serum obtained from subjects who resolved DENV infections, resulted in increased ZIKV infectivity (Dejnirattisai et al., 2016) . These results were confirmed by Charles and Christofferson (2016) , who used a DENV serotype 2-derived mAb (4G2) to demonstrate ADE in ZIKV infections. A contradictory finding is reported by Pantoja et al. (2017) who reported reduction in viremia in DENV-exposed rhesus macaques, when compared with naïve animals. Antibodies to WNV have also shown cross-reactivity with ZIKV E protein, resulting in viremias that were at least 35fold higher than those of the controls, and studies to determine the role of anti-WNV antibodies in enhancing ZIKV revealed a pattern like that observed with anti-DENV antibodies. WNV may enhance ZIKV in vitro as well as in vivo; however, the amplitude of enhancement is less than that of DENV (Bardina et al., 2017) . Because 4G2 is widely used as an anti-flavivirus mAb, the possibility of using this mAb for other flaviviruses such as JEV and YFV or to limit WNV mediated ADE of ZIKV should be considered.",40.386157281256324,16.1805365646579

More recently, ADE was reported for Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the presence of low IgG titers elicited after single immunization by CHIKV vaccine (Hallengärd et al., 2014) . Studies on Ross River virus (RRV) has also shown persistent productive infection of macrophages when using diluted sera from RRV infected patients (Linn et al., 1996) .

Disease enhancement by EBOV antibodies raises the concern of an adverse vaccine effect,0.1783456989264222,2.8992621898651123,3.625192165374756,37f6a419-ff6f-4384-8dc0-93ea1192696b,comm_use_subset/a section of the journal Frontiers in Microbiology Viral-Induced Enhanced Disease Illness,"ADE has also been recorded in Ebola virus (EBOV) infections. EBOV belongs to the Filoviridae family and is the causative agent of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which is a rare but deadly disease (Burk et al., 2016) . The largest Ebola outbreak occurred recently in West Africa, affected around 28,600 individuals and resulted in more than 11,300 death 1 . This massive outbreak prompted intense efforts to develop treatments and vaccines. Disease enhancement by EBOV antibodies raises the concern of an adverse vaccine effect. Several early reports showed that immunization of mice with surface glycoprotein (GP) of the Zaire strain of Ebola (ZEBOV) induces enhanced infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with this protein in vitro. This enhanced activity was shown to occur through an FcR-mediated mechanism (Takada et al., 2001) . Additionally, EBOV enhanced infectivity of non-monocytotic cells was found to occur by a different mechanism that requires the involvement of complement factor 1 (C1). In this case, two or more IgG molecules bind to specific epitopes in close proximity, permitting the binding of C1q to the Fc portion of the antibodies and resulting in a complex formation that enhances virus-cell interactions (Takada and Kawaoka, 2003) . Subsequent studies have showed that ADE of EBOV GP was strain specific and correlated with IgG2, IgG3 and IgM but not the IgG1 class of antibodies, which has low affinity to C1q (Takada et al., 2007) . A recent work by Furuyama et al. investigating the molecular mechanism of EBOV ADE highlighted the involvement of Scr family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in the Fcγ-receptor IIa (FcγRIIa)-mediated ADE (Furuyama et al., 2016) . They found that antibody-virus complexes bind to the cell surface FcγRIIa and trigger the Src signaling pathway, which in turn contributes to facilitating the viral entry into in human leukemia FcγRIIaexpressing cells. Additionally, specific epitopes on ZEBOV GP were found to enhance the infection. This was confirmed by the use of mouse antisera to the chimeric ZEBOV GP lacking the ADE epitopes, where less ADE activity was produced compared to the mouse antisera against the wild-type ZEBOV GP (Takada et al., 2007) . Although some mAb to ZEBOV GP have shown protective effect from lethal infection in mice (Qiu et al., 2011) , enhanced virus infectivity generated by other anti-GP antibodies has raised concerns of using this protein as a vaccine candidate (Taylor et al., 2015) . Recently, a study investigated the ability of mAbs obtained from filovirus human survivors to induce ADE (Kuzmina et al., 2018) . Results showed that at subneutralizing concentration, all mAbs potentiate ADE regardless of particular epitope specificity, neutralizing capacity, or the subclass. Moreover, when Fcγ receptors were blocked, or Fc domain was mutated, a reduced, yet not abolished ADE was observed with high-affinity binding antibodies. Nevertheless, low-affinity binding antibodies were still able to cause ADE. This can explain the previous failure of EBOV therapeutic attempts when insufficient doses of passively transferred antibodies were administered (Kuzmina et al., 2018) . On the other hand, the use of high concentrations of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies showed improved efficacy and absence of ADE in animal models and human volunteers (Kudoyarova-Zubavichene et al., 1999; Corti et al., 2016) . Currently, there is no approved vaccine for EBOV, although many promising vaccine candidates are in clinical trials. This includes vector-based vaccines, such the replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) and the replicationdefective chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3), DNA vaccines, and subunit vaccines (Ohimain, 2016; Pavot, 2016) . Importantly, in light of previously observed EBOV ADE, which is a complex process affected by the different immunization strategies and may lead to extreme virulence, cautions should be taken in designing and developing a new Ebola vaccine. In addition, the vaccine must be carefully tested over a wide dose range in order to define the protective dose that can overcome ADE. Similar to Ebola virus, complement-mediated and FcγRsmediated ADE were reported with in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. It was observed that HIV seropositive sera, which typically have low neutralization activity, have the ability to enhance virus infectivity in cell culture (Robinson et al., 1987) . Specifically, human monoclonal antibodies V10-9, N2-4, and 120-16, which are directed to the transmembrane glycoprotein 41 (gp41), enhanced infectivity of HIV-1 in vitro (Robinson et al., 1990a) . It was then documented that complement receptor 2 (CR2) bearing T cells are susceptible to enhanced infectivity by HIV seropositive sera, concluding that CR2 and CD4 are essential for HIV complement dependent enhancement (Robinson et al., 1990b) . On the other hand, FcR dependent enhancement was observed in macrophages and CD4 T cells, which was specifically mediated by FcRIII (Homsy et al., 1989) . The entry of HIV to CD4 cells is mediated by the conformational changes that occur after the interaction between the HIV envelope protein and CD4, and then chemokine receptor (such as CCR5) on the cell surface. This induces additional conformational changes in gp120 and facilitates its fusion with cell membrane and entry of the viral capsid into the target cell (Guillon et al., 2002) . Therefore, independent from the neutralization capability, antibodies to HIV can enhance the infection by producing conformational changes to the gp120 (Shmelkov et al., 2014) . Although the idea of HIV ADE has been proposed decades ago, shortly after the first isolation of the virus in 1984, it has been ignored in HIV research for long time until enhanced illness was observed in HIV clinical trials (Shmelkov et al., 2014) . Enhanced disease was reported in the RV144 HIV vaccine clinical trial in 2012 and was attributed to non-neutralizing envelope-specific plasma IgA antibodies (Haynes et al., 2012) . Moreover, evaluation of AIDSVAX vaccine (Genentech, U.S.), showed disease enhancement as well. Statistical analysis of AIDSVAX clinical trials indicated that low antibody response to the recombinant glycoprotein 120 (rgp120) increased the rate of HIV infection compared to the control group (Gilbert et al., 2005; Shmelkov et al., 2014) . Significant efforts have been made to identify T-and B-cells protecting and enhancing epitopes. HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb), which are produced in very low number of the infected individuals, typically target conformational epitopes that are masked by glycosylation or not well exposed to the immune system. In contrast, epitopes targeted by T cells are short peptides and can be used to design a vaccine free of non-protective epitopes (Fischer et al., 2007; McCoy and Burton, 2017) . Accordingly, an effective HIV vaccine should be designed to contain both, conserved T cell epitopes, as well as selected B cell epitopes that are capable of strictly eliciting bNAb, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Antibodydependent cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI) rather than harmful antibody responses (Sahay et al., 2017) .",27.576394995941204,13.892633579485334

This has been reported for other feline pathogens, i.e. feline coronavirus (FCoV) which can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [44] . During the pathogenesis of FIP, the virus targets macrophages and infection of these cells can be enhanced in the presence of antibodies (antibody-dependent enhancement, ADE) [45] . Takano et al. [44] showed that cats passively immunized with antibodies to serotype I FCoV showed an enhanced onset of disease following inoculation with the homologous serotype; this was not found when cats passively immunized with antibodies to serotype II FCoV were challenged with serotype I. The authors concluded that FCoV re-infection with the same serotype might induce ADE and could advance the development of FIP. Although ADE has also been suspected in bacterial infection [46] , it is unknown whether it might play a role in the pathogenesis of feline hemoplasma infections [15] . Signs of infection enhancement have recently been documented in ""Candidatus M. turicensis""-recovered, seropositive cats following a challenge with Mhf [15] . The study suggested that the presence of antibodies directed against CMt could enhance Mhf infection. However, to the best of our knowledge, disease enhancement after rechallenge with the same feline hemoplasma species has not been documented. In contrast, two studies showed that cats that had recovered from Mhf or CMt infection were protected from re-infection following re-challenge with the same hemoplasma species, respectively [27, 28] . Both studies had used an aliquot of the same Mhf or CMt isolate for re-infection that had been used for primary infection of the cats (personal communication, RHL).",36.48299076865453,13.69755780000109

Any vaccine that fails to produce broad protective antibodies could lead to adverse effects by rendering vaccinated individuals more susceptible to infection as demonstrated in previous clinical trials. A successful vaccine approach relies on the design of novel immunogen that can induce a balanced and protective immunity. It is now suggested that efficacious vaccines should strictly target protective epitopes (B-and Tcell), which are able to elicit functional immune responses, such as bNAb, ADCC and ADCVI (Sahay et al., 2017) . Moreover, selection of appropriate adjuvants affects vaccine immunogenicity considerably and thus, affects vaccine efficacy. Nonetheless, even when selecting the appropriate antigen and adjuvant, ADE remains a concern when neutralizing antibodies are elicited at sub-neutralizing doses. Consequently, evaluating vaccines in terms of protective and enhancing doses are crucially needed before vaccine administration (Figure 2 ).",21.487824386819188,12.533069830400143

DENVs are group of structurally related, antigenically distinct serotypes, namely DENV1-4 (Diamond and Pierson, 2015) . Infection with one serotype produces protective type-specific antibodies, but cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies against other subtypes that can efficiently enhance the infection (Halstead, 2014) . Halstead et al. first reported enhanced DENV infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) culture obtained from immunized nonhuman primates (NHP) compared to the non-immunized ones (Halstead et al., 1973) . This observation was attributed to the presence of nonneutralizing antibodies that facilitate the viral infection into the mononuclear phagocytes (Halstead et al., 1976; Halstead and O'Rourke, 1977b) . Later subsequent studies revealed that cross-reactive antibodies against different DENV serotypes are predisposing factor for enhanced illness (Morens et al., 1987) . DENV specific ADE was found to be correlated with increased viremia rate (Vaughn et al., 2000) and contribute to the development of severe forms of the disease including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (Guzman et al., 2013) . Epidemiological reports showed that individuals with preexisting dengue immunity had increased risk of developing DHF that required hospitalization (odds ratio of greater than 6.5) (Burke et al., 1988) . Moreover, infants with passive-acquired immunity from DENV immune mothers tend to develop sever DHF following primary DENV infection (Halstead et al., 2002; Simmons et al., 2007) . In addition, secondary heterotypic infection was strongly associated with high viral loads and sever disease (Endy et al., 2004) . As with many other viruses, FcR-mediated, antibody-dependent enhancement is the main mechanism for dengue enhanced disease (Takada and Kawaoka, 2003) . This mechanism has been proven through different models and experiments in vivo and in vitro. For example, the use of FcγR-expressing BHK cells showed that sera from patients after secondary infection produced 10-folds higher virus titers, compared to FcγR-negative cells and sera after primary infection (Moi et al., 2011) . Complement receptors (CR) have been also shown to play a role in DENV enhanced illness. This mechanism was first described by Cardosa et al in early 1980s for another flavivirus, West Nile Virus (WNV), where the enhancement is mediated through CR3 and IgM-dependent manner (Cardosa et al., 1983) . Notably, the CR mechanism of enhancement suggests that infections can spread to non-immune cells as well, since CRs are widely distributed in many cells and are not exclusively restricted to immune cells like FcγRs (Takada and Kawaoka, 2003) .",21.558330853758605,12.424673346670888

Indeed, there are many structural and non-structural proteins of PRRSV which make this possible through their ability to induce a robust humoral immune response [15, 80, 102] . However, recent research on other pathogens has shown that non-neutralizing antibodies may play a much larger role in immunity than was previously appreciated [128] [129] [130] [131] . Alternative antibody functions, such as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent complement-mediated virolysis may be important in the clearance of virus and virally infected cells from an animal. To our knowledge, there are only two published papers investigating non-neutralizing antibody functions in the context of PRRSV infection [59, 132] . Both of these in vitro studies utilized a PRRSV-1 virus and failed to find an effect of ADCC and CDC on infected cells. However, experiments focused on PRRSV-2 viruses with extended time points beyond 12 h are warranted. A more extensive review of non-neutralizing antibody functions can be found in the cited review [133] .",23.743883977458136,12.372829947415829

Although SARS-CoV primarily infects the respiratory tract, it was found that it can directly infect and replicate in human immune cells despite the absence angiotensin Iconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2; SARS receptor) on these cells (Li et al., 2004; Kuba et al., 2005; Imai et al., 2007) . Antibodymediated cell entry was suggested as a possible mechanism for SARS-CoV infection of immune cells (Taylor et al., 2015) . Accordingly, Several studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV mediated ADE. It was initially reported by Kam et al. that immunization with recombinant full-length SARS-CoV spike S-protein elicited protective immune response in vivo, but induced viral infection of human B cells in vitro via FcγRII-dependent and ACE2-independent pathways, suggesting novel ADE mechanism for SARS-CoV (Kam et al., 2007) . Similarly, results of Jaume et al. study showed that anti-spike antibodies were able to potentiate infection of immune cells with both SARS-CoV spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp) and replication-competent SARS-CoV. Likewise, this antibody-mediated infection was FcγRII dependent and ACE2 independent (Jaume et al., 2011) . Another study demonstrated that enhancement of infection with replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoVpp in microphages was linked to antispike IgG, specifically through FcγRII signaling (Yip et al., 2014) . Wang et al. found that ADE response is stimulated by antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins rather than nucleoproteins (Wang et al., 2014) . It was also shown in the same study that ADE response was dependent on antibody titers, as sera with high antibodies concentration neutralized the virus, while diluted sera significantly enhanced the infection and induced more apoptosis (Wang et al., 2014) . Classically, following its binding to ACE2 receptor, SARS-CoV enters susceptible cells through pH-dependent endocytosis (Yang et al., 2004) . Moreover, the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L was found to play a crucial role to achieve an efficient infection (Huang et al., 2006) . In contrast, FcR-mediated infection occur independently of the endosomal acidic pH or the activity of cysteine proteases (Jaume et al., 2011) . Unfortunately, clinical studies investigating ADE in SARS-CoV patients are limited. Several studies have reported no correlation between the clinical outcome and anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in affected individuals (Taylor et al., 2015) . To the contrary, other studies correlated poor prognosis with early SARS-CoV seroconversion (Ho et al., 2005) . Like the story with other viruses, vaccine-induced disease enhancement is also a concern with developing a SARS-CoV vaccine. This was reported in only small subset of SARS-CoV vaccine studies (de Wit et al., 2016) . In a mouse study that investigated the role of SARS-CoV vaccine in inducing disease enhancement, Tseng et al. (2012) it was revealed that vaccines were able to protect against FIGURE 2 | A general strategy for designing an efficacious vaccine that overcomes ADE requires: 1, Identifying the right epitope that elicits functional protective antibodies: An effective vaccine should be designed using conserved and functional epitopes, which usually exist in the pre-fusion conformation of the surface glycoproteins; 2, Selection of the right adjuvant that can direct the immune system toward a balanced Th1/Th2 response; and 3, A carful and accurate assessment of the efficacy and safety of the vaccine at different doses in pre-clinical and clinical trials.",23.418619213515413,12.32049585213747

Further, in an AG129 mouse model, wild-type mAbs ZKA78 and DV82 (without the LALA mutation), when administered prior to DENV-2 infection, resulted in severe disease and death of mice on the 5th day post-infection, suggesting that the DENV infections were affected by the presence of pre-existing ZIKV antibodies (Stettler et al., 2016) . However, antibodies against the envelope dimer epitope 1 (EDE1) region were shown to neutralize ZIKV, in addition to all four DENV serotypes, indicating their potential immune-therapeutic potential in ZIKV infections (Swanstrom et al., 2016) . The mouse mAb 2A10G6 reported to bind the conserved 98DRXW101 motif of the FL loop is a broadly neutralizing antibody. It not only neutralizes DENV1-4, but also protected A129 mice against ZIKV infection . Hence, it seems that the antigenic epitopes against which the antibody is generated is the deciding factor in developing/not developing ADE.

Until this time, ZIKV was considered to induce only mild illness, but it has now been established as the cause of severe clinical manifestations, including fetal anomalies, neurological problems, and autoimmune disorders. Infection during pregnancy can cause congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly and neurological degeneration, and in other cases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, making infections with ZIKV a substantial public health concern. Genomic and molecular investigations are underway to investigate ZIKV pathology and its recent enhanced pathogenicity, as well as to design safe and potent vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics. This review describes progress in the design and development of various anti-ZIKV therapeutics, including drugs targeting virus entry into cells and the helicase protein, nucleosides, inhibitors of NS3 protein, small molecules, methyltransferase inhibitors, interferons, repurposed drugs, drugs designed with the aid of computers, neutralizing antibodies, convalescent serum, antibodies that limit antibody-dependent enhancement, and herbal medicines. Additionally, covalent inhibitors of viral protein expression and anti-Toll-like receptor molecules are discussed. To counter ZIKVassociated disease, we need to make rapid progress in developing novel therapies that work effectually to inhibit ZIKV.",19.561672787356876,11.092225276600297

The virus has three structural proteins: capsid (C), pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E), and seven non-structural proteins (Colpitts et al., 2012) . Human WNV infection causes subclinical febrile illness in about 80% of the cases, and leads to lethal encephalitis in <1% of these patients. Whether this is related to ADE is still not fully known (Taylor et al., 2015) . Similar to DENV disease enhancement, the main cause of ADE in WNV infection is related to the presence of sub-neutralizing concentration of antibodies, which bind to the virion and facilitate its entry to cells bearing Fc-γ receptors (Pierson et al., 2007) . In addition to antibodies titer, protection or diseases enhancement by WNV mAb depends on the class and the isotype of the antibodies (Cardosa et al., 1986) . Complementmediated ADE has been also reported in WNV infection. In one study, viral infectivity of FcR-bearing cells was enhanced in the presence of antiviral monoclonal IgM antibodies, and this enhancement was blocked by anti-complement receptor type 3 (CR3) antibody but not by antibodies specific to FcR (Cardosa et al., 1983) . As with other flaviviruses, the E glycoprotein is the primary target of neutralizing immune responses (Colombage et al., 1998) . As previously described for DENV, domain II of the E protein encompasses epitopes near the fusion loop which elicit cross-reactive but sub-neutralizing antibodies and thus, enhance the risk of ADE (Oliphant et al., 2006) . On the other hand, the most potent neutralizing antibody response to WNV infection in mice is directed to domain III of the E protein (Pierson et al., 2007) . Strong neutralizing potency was demonstrated by antibodies that bind the DI-II region of E protein, such as CR4354 antibody, which was isolated from a WNV infected patient (Vogt et al., 2009 ). Epitopes at this region are exclusively found on the intact virion, but not on the recombinant E protein, and are composed of amino acid residues that interact with both monomers in the E dimer at the hinge region between EDI and EDII (Brandler and Tangy, 2013) . Antibodies to those epitopes were found to neutralize WNV infection by neutralizing the virus in a post-attachment step, thus, preventing the rearrangement of E proteins into a fusion-active state required for the pH-induced infection of the host cell (Kaufmann et al., 2010) .",19.954158820219725,9.006379656123878

There are four serotypes of DENV (1) (2) (3) (4) , which together cause an estimated 50 million human infections per year [29] , and each can cause DF, DHF or DSS. Because of the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), or other immune phenomena, protection against one DENV serotype increases the risk of DHF or DSS when the individual is exposed to another serotype [30] [31] [32] .

Virus infection was completely inhibited at concentrations that had no adverse effect on the host cells. These findings were corroborated by quantification of viral RNA levels in culture supernatant. Antiviral activity was also observed against other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever virus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In particular, potent antiviral activity was observed against TBEV. Time-of-drugaddition experiments indicated that LCTA-949 inhibits an early stage in the DENV replication cycle; however, a virucidal effect was excluded. This observation was corroborated by the fact that LCTA-949 lacks activity on DENV subgenomic replicon (that does not encode structural proteins) replication. Using a microsopy-based binding and fusion assay employing DiD-labeled viruses, it was shown that LCTA-949 targets the early stage (binding/entry) of the infection. Moreover, LCTA-949 efficiently inhibits infectivity of DENV particles pre-opsonized with antibodies, thus potentially also inhibiting antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).

The incidence and geographical distribution of the four distinct DENV serotypes and its vector are increasing dramatically. DENV causes more than 50 million infections annually (mainly in South-East Asia and Latin America) and infections with this virus may develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [2] [3] [4] . Increased disease severity has been associated with pre-existing heterologous DENV antibodies, a phenomenon described as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Antibodies have been found to enhance viral entry into Fc-c-receptor-bearing cells and to alter the antiviral immune response, leading to increased virus particle production and subsequent immune activation. During homologous re-infection, antibodies are believed to neutralize the infecting virus and provide life-long protection against disease development. Intriguingly, however, during heterologous re-infection, cross-reactive antibodies have been implicated to enhance viral replication leading to a higher infected cell mass and increased viral burden. There is neither a vaccine nor a specific antiviral therapy available [3] . This is also the case for YFV that, together with DENV, is a leading cause of hemorrhagic fever worldwide, although a highly efficacious vaccine is available [5] . Furthermore, vector-control strategies that were once successful in eliminating YFV have faltered, thereby leading to a re-emergence of the disease [5] .

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is thought to be a major contributor to severe disease following secondary infection [4] . In a secondary infection with a heterologous serotype, the virus forms immune complexes with pre-existing sub-neutralizing antibodies and bind to Fc-receptorbearing cells, leading to increased infection and viral replication [5] . The cell biology of ADE is not fully understood, but some proposed mechanisms include: increased virus attachment to the cell surface, increased efficiency in post-attachment steps due to Fc-receptor-mediated signaling, delivery of antibody-virus complexes to more favorable locations in the endocytic compartment, and direct alterations in the fusion process (reviewed in [6, 7] ).",40.57818467821163,17.03849698495784

There are 4 similar but distinct serotypes of dengue viruses (ie, DEN 1-4). Until recently, there was no vaccine (it was under development and trial) and no specific treatment available. In the past 50 years, dengue incidence has increased 30-fold in tropical areas, 27 a concern in a time of climate change. The threat is compounded by the fact that immunity is life-long for only the strain responsible for the infection; cross immunity for the other 3 strains is partial and temporary. 28 Moreover, reinfection with a different strain carries greater risk of life-threatening complications resulting from antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with increased risk of hemorrhagic fever. 26, 29, 30 To better understand the dynamics of this complex disease, scientists at IBM Research and the University of California San Francisco used STEM to test 3 models of increasing complexity. 31 The first ''host only'' model is based on work reported in the literature. 32 The second model includes the mosquito vector, and the third adds a variable defining the incubation period in humans to the compartment model. Results in all 3 models showed that cross immunity alone did not account for the dynamics (ie, 3-4 years outbreak periodicity) observed in the data reported from Thailand; 33 significant levels of antibody dependent enhancement were also required. In repeated simulations, the first model showed a high degree of chaotic behavior. The other 2 more complex models diminished this instability, suggesting that explicitly including the mosquito vector may support efforts to calibrate a model based on surveillance data and to achieve greater predictability.",39.14887655313448,16.378351427986942

The availability of numerous broadly neutralizing mAbs for HIV provides the impetus for determining the most appropriate mAb combinations.

Along these lines, a role for the interaction between immune complexes consisting of IgGs and hRSV (ICs) with Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) could be a process contributing to both, re-infection episodes, and enhancement of hRSV-disease elicited by vaccination with formalin-inactivated hRSV (FI-hRSV) and later hRSV natural infection (Kim et al., 1969) . This hypothesis is supported by the fact that high amounts of antibodies with low neutralizing activity can be induced by immunization with FI-hRSV, which correlates with enhancement of the hRSV-induced disease (Kapikian et al., 1969; Kim et al., 1969) . Therefore, it is possible that these low affinity antibodies promote the infection of FcγR-bearing cells through a phenomena called antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), as previously observed for other viruses (Yip et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2015; Flipse et al., 2016) . Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the blockade or absence of particular FcγRs expressed on the surface of immune cells can modulate the immune response against this virus and the onset of hRSVinduced disease (Osiowy et al., 1994; Kruijsen et al., 2013; Gomez et al., 2016; van Erp et al., 2018) .

For more than a century, toxins have been believed to be neutralized by antibodies not by indirect mediated measures but rather by a direct ""interfering"" antibody-dependent mechanism in which antibodies bind to toxins and interfere with their interactions with host cells, thus preventing the attachment of the toxin to the target cell or its enzymatic activity that might otherwise damage the target cell.

In some cases, ADCP has been demonstrated to promote infection. Termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), this has predominantly been described for viruses from the genus Flavivirus including dengue virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and zika virus (135) (136) (137) (138) (139) (140) . Fc receptor-dependent ADE is a particular concern for infections by dengue virus (141) (142) (143) . There are four serotypes of dengue virus, and antibodies generated in response to infection with one serotype have variable degrees of cross reactivity to the other three serotypes. Upon re-challenge with the original serotype, antibodies are protective. However, the pre-existing antibody response will augment infection and promote more severe disease upon secondary infection with any of the other serotypes (143) . Moreover, ADE resulting from cross reactivity may not be limited to secondary infection with another strain of the same virus; ADE might also occur when the secondary infection is a different but closely related virus. For example, the results of recent studies have suggested that dengue virus-specific antibodies may be capable of enhancing zika virus infection (144) , and reciprocally, that zika virus-specific antibodies may be capable of enhancing dengue virus infection (140) . These observations have been met with skepticism (145) , and additional work will be required to demonstrate that this type of ADE has clinical relevance to dengue and zika incidence and disease. ADE is thought to occur when non-neutralizing antibodies, or suboptimal concentrations of neutralizing antibodies, bind and opsonize virus, and are subsequently internalized by Fc receptor expressing cells via ADCP. Within the cells these immune complexes may perturb normal antiviral immune functions resulting in the virus not being destroyed. Instead, the virus exploits ADCP as a tool to expand access to host cells, resulting in higher infection burden and often stimulating an overt inflammatory response that contributes to disease pathogenesis (143) . How do viruses such as dengue subvert the process of ADCP to promote increased infection? One potential mechanism that has been proposed to allow for dengue virus to escape Fc receptormediated antiviral signaling is through engaging the inhibitory receptor leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1) (146) . Thus, for dengue and other viruses, the outcome of each interaction between antibody-virus immune complexes and phagocytes depends on the balance of activating signals, which are expected to promote ADCP and virus elimination, and inhibitory signals, which have the potential to enhance infection.",34.67369199661872,14.409881117979301

However, unlike acute viral pathogens, HIV-1 chronically replicates in the host and evades the antibody response. This immune evasion, along with the large genetic variation among HIV-1 strains worldwide, has posed major obstacles to vaccine development. Current HIV vaccine candidates do not elicit neutralizing antibodies against most circulating virus strains, and thus the induction of a protective antibody response remains a major priority for HIV-1 vaccine development. For an antibody-based HIV-1 vaccine, progress in vaccine design is generally gauged by in vitro assays that measure the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize a broad spectrum of viral isolates representing the major genetic subtypes (clades) of HIV-1 [2] . Although it is not known what magnitude and breadth of neutralization will predict protection in vaccine recipients, it is clear that current vaccine immunogens elicit antibodies that neutralize only a minority of circulating isolates.

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is the phenomenon that heterotypic antibodies do not neutralize virions of the subsequent infecting DENV type, but facilitate virus entry, replication in target immune cells, and consequently lead to higher viremia [44] . It is widely regarded as one of the reason for the development of severe dengue [45] . A study indicated that ADE was inversely correlated with surface expression of DC-SIGN in vitro: Mature DC, which expresses lower level of DC-SIGN, exhibited ADE, while immature DC, expressing higher levels of DC-SIGN, did not undergo ADE [21] . Platelets from DENV-infected patients present signs of activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of apoptosis caspase cascade, which may contribute to the genesis of thrombocytopenia. DC-SIGN, as a critical receptor, was involved in this progress of DENV-dependent platelet activation [22, 23] . Expression of DC-SIGN was downregulated on platelets in patients with dengue infection, and the decreased receptor expression diminishes platelet activation [46] .

Antibodies can exert their protective functions via a multitude of mechanisms. Some functions, such as neutralization, mainly depend on interaction of the Fv domain ( Figure 1A ) with antigen and are therefore predominantly Fc domain independent. Other functions, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), require interactions between the antibody Fc domain with other proteins or immune effector cells via recognition by Fc receptors (9) (10) (11) (Figures 1A-C) . These Fc receptor-dependent antibody functions provide a direct link between the innate and adaptive immune systems, harnessing the potent anti-pathogen functions of the innate immune system, and overcoming its inherent limited pattern recognition capacity by utilizing the diversity and specificity of the adaptive immune response. Fc receptordependent antibody functions are important components of the immune response that provide mechanisms for clearance of infected host cells, immune complexes, or opsonized pathogens.

Naïve B cells are stimulated and develop into DENV-specific B cells, which either differentiate into memory B cells (MBCs) residing in the secondary lymphoid organs or into plasma cells (PCs) secreting antigen-specific antibodies (Abs). Short-lived PCs are active during acute infection, while long-lived PCs (LLPCs) migrate to the bone marrow and are responsible for long-term humoral immunity [6, 7] . MBCs, which retain antigen-specific Abs at their surface, and LLPCs, which secrete antigen-specific Abs, undergo affinity maturation, and only clones bearing Abs with the highest affinity survive long-term [8] . This process takes several weeks after acute infection and continues despite the absence of circulating antigen. During a secondary (2u) DENV infection, MBCs are rapidly activated [9, 10] . Prior DENV infection provides robust immunity against the homotypic DENV serotype [11, 12] . In contrast, 2u heterotypic infections are associated with a higher incidence of DHF/DSS, possibly attributable in part to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), where pre-formed Abs to the 1u infecting serotype bind but do not neutralize the 2u infecting serotype, instead facilitating an increase in viral uptake by Fcc-receptor bearing cells [13] . In addition to ADE, cross-reactive T cells formed during the 1u DENV infection can be over-activated, potentially contributing to dengue pathogenesis [14, 15] . However, the vast majority of 2u DENV infections are asymptomatic or only result in mild disease [16] , suggesting a protective immune response [17] .",30.077487642091732,12.669671620014087

Moreover, as mentioned above, viral epitopes for the known broadly neutralizing MAbs appear to be poorly immunogenic in infected individuals and as vaccine candidates. Insights into the immunoregulation of some of these latter epitopes (e.g., epitopes defined by MAbs 2F5 and 4E10) was provided by recent studies in which the MAbs were discovered to bind one or more self antigens [50, 51] , raising the possibility that these antibody specificities are subjected to negative regulation mechanisms, such as receptor editing or deletion. Thus, Env as an immunogen may bypass key steps in the B cell inductive pathway, or may actively induce negative production or downregulation of production of some broadly neutralizing antibodies [52] [53] [54] .",23.438111200390427,11.37918454911347

Importantly, there is substantial evidence that supports ADCP as contributing either to protection from infection, or reduction in disease severity for diverse types of viruses. In most cases, it is likely that ADCP works in tandem with additional Fc-independent and Fc-dependent antiviral activities as part of an effective polyfunctional humoral response. In fact, for many viruses that have been demonstrated to have antibody-dependent correlates of protection it is highly likely that ADCP is involved, but perhaps was not thoroughly explored. Additional investigation into the role of ADCP in protective viral responses, and the specific virus epitopes targeted by ADCP antibodies, may provide insight into strategies for rational vaccine design to elicit these types of antibody responses while avoiding deleterious ADE activity. Additionally, identifying the types of phagocytes and Fc receptors involved in ADCP at sites of virus infection within tissues, throughout the course of infection and virus clearance, remains an understudied aspect of host and virus interactions. Finally, as most ADCP assays used to measure this immune response in vitro quantify uptake of virus subunits, virions, and in some cases infected cells, there remains a gap in knowledge regarding the outcome of phagocytosis. Further research into this area could determine if protection by ADCP is dependent on clearance and elimination of virus and virus infected cells, or by potentiating subsequent immune responses via antigen presentation or immune signaling. As our understanding of ADCP grows, it is likely that approaches to successfully leverage this important immune response for improved antiviral immunity will be discovered.",19.26717463707552,11.31350500038732

Another recent study has reported an association between higher ratios of cross-reactive ELISA versus neutralizing antibody titers early during A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and more severe illness [41] .

Unlike the current ferret or prior human studies, however, these swine studies used adjuvanted whole virion vaccine that was additionally heterosubtypic for the neuraminidase surface protein (i.e. N2 versus N1), the relevance of which is uncertain.

This level and timing of peak viraemia is consistent with virological data from secondary DF and DHF patients [9] . This reparametrization can also be easily interpreted biologically in the context of a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which proposes that antibodies from a first infection cross-react with virus from a secondary infection, but lead to incomplete neutralization.

The first observation was made by Robinson et al. (1988 Robinson et al. ( , 1989 who demonstrated using patient serum that liaison between antibody and complement results in enhanced HIV infection. This phenomenon was later dubbed as complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV infection (C-ADE) (Robinson et al., 1990) . Afterward, multiple studies including experimental infection in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with SIV presented data supporting this thesis [reviewed in detail in (Stoiber et al., 2008) ]. The complement opsonized virions bound to CD35 on erythrocytes are also liable for spread to antigen-presenting cells bearing CR-2, -3, and -4 (Hess et al., 2002) . Specifically, it was hypothesized that CD35 on erythrocytes can support the cleavage of C3b attached to HIV with the help of factor I, the cleaved C3b (iC3b or C3dg) has less affinity for CD35 and hence will be transferred to antigen-presenting cells decorated with receptors for inactivated C3b. Supporting this, iC3b coated HIV display enhanced infection of monocytes/macrophages and DCs expressing CR-3 and CR-4, wherein the complement-opsonized HIV efficiently bypasses the SAMHD1 restriction in DCs (Posch et al., 2015) . Similarly, C3d coated HIV were shown to be associated with B cells that express CD21 (Moir et al., 2000) . It is likely that these viruses carrying B cells disseminate infection systemically. Further, in vitro experiments have also shown the CD21 dependent transfer of HIV from B cells to T cells (Jakubik et al., 2000; Moir et al., 2000) . In addition to B cells, follicular dendritic cells also trap HIV which is maintained in the germinal centers (Joling et al., 1993; Kacani et al., 2000) and it is believed that this is critical for the pathogenesis of HIV infection (Stoiber et al., 2003) .",22.7939842186182,10.158662233216885

Seminal studies by Albert Sabin, dating from the WWII era [148] , have demonstrated that volunteers exposed to DENV showed long-lived homotypic immunity but short-lived cross-protection against viruses of a different serotype. However, the mechanisms behind these observations are still not fully understood and prospective studies at the population level show that these conclusions cannot be generalized to inform rational vaccine design [149] . While a majority of DENV infections go unnoticed, some infected individuals progress along the disease spectrum and develop dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock. Although no consensus exists about the pathophysiology behind this progression, it is most likely due to host-specific factors related to the presence of preexisting immunity such as antibody-dependent enhancements (ADE) and immune-mediated cytokine storm related to the antigenic sin phenomenon that occurs even past the peak in viremia in symptomatic individuals [10, 150] . Indeed, a second heterologous DENV infection is expected to elicit a strong memory recall of DENV-specific T and B cells that will produce an enhanced level of cytokines and neutralizing antibodies. However, this adaptive immune response might not lead to the control of viremia but rather quite the opposite, resulting in an antibody-dependent enhanced infection (virus opsonization and increased replication), mast cell activation (vascular permeability), and cellular cytotoxicity (cytokine storm) [151] . With this in mind, an effective antiviral therapy would need to be taken as a prophylactic treatment and would most likely be highly expensive given the number of individuals living in endemic areas. Thus, the only way to eradicate dengue worldwide would be to develop a safe, effective, and pan-serotypic vaccine that confers long-term sterilizing immunity.",21.816030358616842,9.91356323100181

It was proposed that FcγR participates in immune evasion by promoting 'antibody bipolar bridging, ' i.e., HSV antibody interacts with the FcγR on one end and target antigen on the other resulting in inhibition of Fc domain functions (Frank and Friedman, 1989) . This notion was well-supported by the crystal structure of HSV-1 FcγR bound to IgG Fc (Sprague et al., 2006) . In addition, in vitro studies showed that presence of FcγR protects HSV-1 from antibody-dependent complement-mediated neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (Frank and Friedman, 1989; Dubin et al., 1991; Lubinski et al., 2011) . These results were also corroborated by in vivo infection studies (Lubinski et al., 2011) . Together, the aforementioned studies provided compelling evidence that immune evasion molecules such as gC and gE/gI play an essential role in HSV infection.

In recent years, it has been shown that autophagy has a role in many emerging and re-emerging infectious viral and bacterial diseases that pose significant threats to humans. Autophagy initially encounters these infectious pathogens to neutralize them; however, may infections can propagate themselves as persistent intracellular infections and are generally associated with wide outbreaks, epidemics, and highly devastating effects. Many viral life cycles are linked with autophagic pathways. The influenza A virus induces autophagosome formation during the early stages of infection and inhibits autophagosomal maturation during the later stages. Classical swine fever virus replication is negatively regulated by mTORC1 via autophagy and IRES-dependent translation, whilst Dengue/Zika virus pathogenicity is modulated by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) which can induce autophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Multimodal necrotic cell death is driven by open reading frame-3a of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV), that triggers the lysosomal damage and dysfunction and therefore transcription of autophagy-related genes is enhanced, whilst endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in Dengue virus (DENV) infections results in autophagy activation, viral replication, and pathogenesis. The disruption of mitochondrial membrane potentials by the non-structural protein of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus results in apoptosis, whereas paramyxovirus V proteins inhibit constitutively active MDA5 proteins to induce autophagy. All of these viral events are related to autophagy and can provide directions for future therapies for Chikungunya (CHIKV), DENV, and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections. Autophagy has a pivotal role in viral diseases such as bird flu [32], swine fever [33], Ebola virus disease [20], ZIKV infection [34,35], SARS [36], CHIKV infection [37], DENV infection [38], viral encephalitis [39], CCHF [40], Hendra virus (HeV) infection [41], Nipah virus (NiV) infection [42], and the West Nile virus (WNV) infection [43]. Apart from these, other viral diseases, such as rabies, rotavirus enteritis, and smallpox, have already posed a serious threat to human life [44-48]. Autophagy has also been shown to have a central role in microbial infections [49], including those caused by Listeria [50], Salmonella [51], Shigella [52], and Streptococcus [53]. Autophagy can kill or eradicate infectious disease-causing pathogens via the autophagosome or autophagolysosome (autolysosome) to prevent or treat infection [20, 21] ; however, autophagy can also disseminate pathogens during pathogenesis. For example, gut epithelial autophagy can disseminate viruses and bacteria in enteric diseases. Therefore, autophagy can play a dual role in infections [20, 21, 54] .",18.178881164895454,8.817097531534667

PRRS virus (PRRSV) replicates mainly in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) and develops persistent infections, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), interstitial pneumonia and immunosuppression. But the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection still are poorly understood. Here we report on the first genome-wide host transcriptional responses to classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a infection using Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tagbased high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method, and analyse systematically the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after N-PRRSV infection and infection pathology. Our results suggest that N-PRRSV appeared to utilize multiple strategies for its replication and spread in infected pigs, including subverting host innate immune response, inducing an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory state as well as developing ADE. Upregulation expression of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes and inflammatory cells, antibodies, complement activation were likely to result in the development of inflammatory responses during N-PRRSV infection processes. N-PRRSV-induced immunosuppression might be mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused depletion of immune cells and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will benefit for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV infection, developing novel antiviral therapies and identifying genetic components for swine resistance/susceptibility to PRRS.",28.093871353573817,10.839082079606777

Therefore, we performed an isotype-specific ELISA utilizing full-length EBOV GP to determine if any differences in the antibody isotypes occurred between the vaccines. As shown in Figure 6 , the positive control NHP ratio of IgG2/IgG1 on day 0 post-challenge was around 1.0, whereas this ratio was an average of about 2.0 for all the vaccinated animals from groups 2-4.

This model, in which the immunized mice are challenged with a highly pathogenic VV (the Western Reserve (WR) strain), is one of the most popular methods of evaluating the efficacy of smallpox vaccines [62] (Figure 3 ). We immunized each group of mice with a single dose (10 4 , 10 5 or 10 6 PFU) of each VV via the intramuscular (i.m.) route. We found that the level of protective immunity elicited by LCm8∆ was comparable with that elicited by Dryvax and superior to that elicited by MVA. For example, the minimal dose (10 4 PFU) of LC16m8∆ or Dryvax fully protected mice from lethal infection with WR, whereas mice immunized with MVA, LC16m8, m8B5R or m8dTM, lost weight and, in some cases, died. The maximum dose (10 6 PFU) of MVA resulted in prominent weight loss after WR challenge. It is noteworthy that immunization with LCm8∆ was more efficient than that with m8B5R or m8dTM when compared at their minimal dose. In particular, m8B5R was significantly inferior to LC16m8∆ (t-test, p = 0.005). These results suggest that B5R does not play a major role in eliciting protective immune responses in these mice. In addition, LC16m8∆ elicited protective immune responses in cynomolgus monkeys and fully protected them against lethal infection with monkeypox virus [63] . Taken together, these data suggest that LC16m8∆ is as effective as the first-generation smallpox vaccine, Dryvax. Although several studies report that the B5 protein is the major target of EEV-neutralizing antibodies, which are significant for protection against smallpox infection, immunization with B5-deficient vaccine viruses protects animals against lethal challenge by pathogenic orthopoxviruses [58, [64] [65] [66] [67] . In addition, some reports show that smallpox vaccines do not always induce anti-B5 antibodies, and antibody response profiles against each viral protein are highly heterologous in humans [68] [69] [70] . They also concluded that the key to inducing a strong neutralizing antibody response is to elicit antibodies that recognize multiple viral proteins; these antibodies then act synergistically to provide better protection.

Adults with Down syndrome (DS) are particularly susceptible to respiratory infections, and respiratory disease is a primary cause of death in individuals with DS over the age of 20 years. Although no studies to date have identified the pathogens responsible for the majority of respiratory infections observed in adults with DS, data from previous influenza epidemics suggest that individuals with DS have significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality as a result of influenza infection. Data evaluating the effectiveness of immunizations in individuals with DS is limited and inconclusive, although it has been established that those with DS have decreased B cell counts. Herein, the King lab hypothesized that adults with DS will have an attenuated antibody response to immunization. Antibody titers to influenza A, influenza B and Bordetella pertussis were evaluated using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Their results demonstrated that adults with DS had decreased antibody titers to influenza B and pertussis toxin. Interestingly, adults with DS had significantly increased IgG antibody titer to Influenza A compared to age matched controls (p value = 0.005). They hypothesize that this may be due to adults with DS acquiring a subclinical influenza A infection despite immunization. This outbreak highlighted EBOV's ability to cause massive epidemic events and the need for a safe and efficacious vaccine that protects against ebola virus disease for health care workers and people of endemic regions. The V920 vaccine, being developed by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA and NewLink Genetics (Ames, IA, USA), is a live, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-Indiana (VSV-I) where the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene is replaced with the glycoprotein of Zaire-EBOV (ZEBOV). The vaccine has been tested in numerous Phase 1-3 clinical trials, and the data suggest that the vaccine is generally well tolerated and effective at preventing ebola virus disease. Since the V920 vaccine candidate is constructed using the backbone of an arbovirus, studies evaluating the potential for V920 to replicate and transmit in arthropods are necessary. To accomplish this, they assessed the ability of V920 to replicate in several sandfly and mosquito cell lines, intra-thoracically (IT) inoculated and blood-fed Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. A wild-type VSV-I was used as a positive control and a VSV-I vectored vaccine against Semliki Forest virus (rVSV-SFV) was used as a comparator in all experiments.

These often are family members, health care workers as well as pets and other animals in close contact with the vaccinee. Knowledge about biodistribution, shedding and the immunological status of the vaccinee close contacts will help in identifying the route of transmission. If the virus-vector is inadvertently transmitted to these individuals, clearance should be effective given that a good proportion of the population already have pre-existing immunity to VACV/MVA. However, should the close contacts have compromised immunity due to old age, very young, sick or are on immunosuppressive drugs, clearance may be inefficient and the consequences of infection might be more significant. In these individuals, interactions (exchange of genetic materials, helper functions of gene products/factors) between GM virus vector and resident natural viruses could generate quasi virus species that are unstable and constantly mutate. This could lead to species with altered epitopes and thus less infectivity [164] . Altered epitope can result in less efficient immune clearance due to weak binding to receptors on the immune cells and can lead to establishment of chronic, latent or persistent infections. A situation in which non-neutralizing antibodies facilitate the infection of other cells (antibody-dependent enhancement of infection) may arise [165, 166] . With respect to MVA/MVA-vectored vaccines, the potential for transmission to non-target hosts is low due to its multiplication incompetence in most mammalian cells.

FECV is mucosally transmitted, replicates to the greatest levels in the intestinal tract, and most commonly persists in the colonic epithelium [3, 4] . While some cats are able to control FECV replication and eliminate the infection, others remain infected and are intermittent or persistent virus shedders [5] [6] [7] . Additionally, immunity to FECV is not life-long, so reinfection can occur, with FECV continually churning in cat populations, particularly within shelters or breeding colonies through cycles of repeated exposure, infection, and shedding. Within FECV-infected cats, the combination of high virus replication and high error rate in RNA replication results in innumerable mutations. If a mutation occurs that allows the virus to escape immune surveillance and efficiently infect and replicate in monocytes, it can then systemically spread, and fatal FIP may occur [2] .

The incidence of DHF/DSS is higher in people with previous exposure to different serotypes of DENV, and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may be a mechanism for DHF/DSS [1] . Enhancing antibodies may increase viral entry and increase the number of infected cells. DENV infection via the ADE route has also been shown to downregulate several genes of the innate immunity system, resulting in suppression of the innate response and increase of DENV replication [35, 36, 37] . In this study, we further demonstrate that DENV per se is a weak cytokine inducer because IL-10, IL-12, and TNFa were induced to a lower extent in DENV-2infected BMDCs.

They can either neutralize viral particles via their antigen binding fragment (Fab) domains or interact with innate immune receptors, such as crystallizable fragment-gamma receptors (FcγRs), via their crystallizable fragment (Fc) domains. The diverse FcγR-mediated mechanisms to eliminate targets exposing vulnerable antigens include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis (ADCML) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). ADCC is mediated by effector cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and monocytes, that release cytotoxic molecules to eliminate virally infected cells [1] . In humans, this response is initiated by the Fc regions of IgG1 or IgG3 subtypes that bind the activating FcγRIIIa (CD16a) receptor on effector cells [2] . This is followed by the cross-linking of the FcγRs, resulting in intracellular signaling via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs to release granzyme B and perforin granules [3] . Granzyme B causes DNA fragmentation and apoptosis of the target cell [4] . Additionally, signaling via CD16a also leads to the secretion of several cytokines and chemokines, including IFN-γ, TNF, and β-chemokines that inhibit viral spread [5] [6] [7] . ADCP is carried out by monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils. These phagocytes can be engaged by either complement receptors and/or FcγRs, including FcγRIIa (CD32a) and FcγRI (CD64) [8, 9] .

Several members of the Flavivirus and Hepacivirus genera are human pathogens that cause millions of infections annually and thus exert a global burden on public health [14, 15, 198] . HCV, a member of the Hepacivirus genus, is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis and at least 3% of the human population is infected by HCV worldwide [200, 201] . Long-term chronic HCV infection often leads to multiple liver diseases, including steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [202, 203] . The four prevalent human pathogens DENV, WNV, JEV and ZIKV belong to the genus Flavivirus [199, 204, 205] . These mosquito-transmitted viruses account for most severe arbovirus infections in the human population and irregular outbreaks exert an enormous threat on global health [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] [210] [211] [212] . Primary DENV infection often causes reactions ranging from asymptomatic illness to symptoms such as rush, headache and dengue fever [205, 206, 213] . Secondary, homo-or heterotypic infections may develop into severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), most likely due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which increases viral infectivity and pathogenicity [205, 206, 213, 214] . JEV is a major cause of encephalitis flavivirus in the Asia-Pacific region [207, 208, 215] . No significant symptoms are observed in the vast majority of JEV-infected individuals but severe clinical illness still occurs in rare cases of infection, resulting in an approximately 30% mortality rate, particularly in children [207, 208, 215] . Most remnant-infected patients who survive often suffer permanent neurological deficits, including seizures, paralysis and mental retardation [207, 208, 215] . WNV is an emerging and mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that causes fever and neuroinvasive diseases, including encephalitis and poliomyelitis [210, 216] and serious illness in aged and immunocompromised patients often introduces a higher risk of mortality [217, 218] .

The development of an effective vaccine against Zika virus may be problematic because of the cross reactivity of the antibodies with other flaviviruses leading to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Moreover, rapidly replicating positive strand RNA viruses, including Zika virus, generate large spectrum of mutant genomes (quasi species) every replication round, allowing rapid selection of variants resistant to drugs targeting virus-specific proteins. On the other hand, viruses are ultimate cellular parasites and rely on the host metabolism for every step of their life cycle, thus presenting an opportunity to manipulate host processes as an alternative approach to suppress virus replication and spread. Zika and other flaviviruses critically depend on the cellular secretory pathway, which transfers proteins and membranes from the ER through the Golgi to the plasma membrane, for virion assembly, maturation and release. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of interactions of Zika and similar arthropod-borne flaviviruses with the cellular secretory machinery with a special emphasis on virus-specific changes of the secretory pathway.

A dengue vaccine sponsored by Sanofi Pasteur has been licensed in multiple dengue endemic countries, and several candidate vaccines are at various stages of development (73) . Although the US military has maintained interest in several different candidate vaccine to prevent dengue, Sanofi Pasteur in 2010 initiated the first phase 2b proof of concept trial using their CYD tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV). The trial was conducted in Thailand among 4,000 children aged 4-11 years. CYD-TDV is composed of four chimeric live-attenuated viruses (CYD1-4) based on a yellow fever vaccine backbone (YF 17D) with structural DENV proteins (74) . Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that a three-dose vaccination regimen induced balanced immune responses to all four serotypes, and pre-existing flavivirus infection seemed to induce a more rapid immune response with no increase in vaccine-derived viremia. Unfortunately, this tetravalent vaccine did not provide equal protection against all four dengue serotypes, with especially low efficacy against DENV-2 (75). Subsequent multi-country phase III trials in Asia and Latin America in 2-to 16-year-old children showed good efficacy against DENV-3 and 4, moderate efficacy against DENV-1 and marginal efficacy against DENV-2. Notably, an increase in relative risk of severe dengue in vaccine recipients aged 2-5 years during the third year of the Asian phase III trial (76, 77) led to the age indication of children 9 years of age and above. CYD-TDV (trademarked as Dengvaxia ® ) eventually received licensure in 20 dengue endemic countries but has not yet been approved in the US. Based on an assessment of potential overall public health benefit, WHO recommended in July 2016 that vaccination could be carried out in highly endemic areas (>70% dengue seropositive rates) (65, 78) . However, in November 2017 Sanofi, who continued to monitor safety of their vaccine, announced the results from a new laboratory test that could infer dengue serostatus prior to vaccination in subjects from their phase III trials and found that seronegative persons of any age (including those >9 years) who receive Dengvaxia ® had a higher risk of severe dengue. On April 19, 2018, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization revised their recommendations, emphasizing individual testing before vaccinating in order to minimize the likelihood of seronegative individuals receiving Dengvaxia ® . 1 The US army initially focused on tetravalent live-attenuated vaccine candidates, entering into a partnership with GSK in early 2000. A tetravalent live-attenuated dengue vaccine candidate was eventually evaluated in a phase II clinical trial in Puerto Rico (79) .

The YFV 17D-based chimeric dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi-Pasteur is the most advanced in clinical testing [38, 39] . The establishment of reverse genetic manipulation of DENV has greatly facilitated the generation of promising vaccine candidates [36, 38] . The recent progress in understanding the mechanism of attenuation of 29-O-MTase mutant flaviviruses has provided a novel approach for vaccine and antiviral development [40] .

Importantly, enhancement of infection was not observed after heterologous infection of immunized mice. The fear in a clinical setting is that sub-neutralizing titers of antibodies could enhance infections, even though this has so far not happened in the context of vaccine trials in humans [41] . A commonly used approach to address ADE in vitro is to infect K562 cells in the presence of antibodies. Virus alone is not able to infect K562 cells efficiently, whereas virus-antibody immune complexes bind to K562 cells via Fc-c receptors (FccR's), assisting the internalization of the virus and infection of the cells. We found that K562 cells could be infected in the presence of serum from immunized mice and monkeys at dilutions that were approximately 50% neutralizing in the U937-DC-SIGN system (Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4 ). This is in line with a previous report, which found that even strongly neutralizing antibodies are enhancing at concentrations that are close to the 50% neutralizing titer [42] . Clinically relevant ADE would be expected at sub-neutralizing titers and only after heterologous infection, and this was not observed in our experiments. A caveat of the K562 system is that the cells do not express inhibitory FccRIIb, which is present on human target cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) and which negatively regulates ADE [43, 44] . Physiological amounts of complement, another negative regulator of ADE, are also not taken into account [45] . In summary, while the K562 assays done here did not show more ADE for heterologous infections, we cannot exclude ADE because of the limitations of the assay.

Mutant viruses cause the same or less antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) than the respective wild-type viruses in the heterologous setting (0.5160.16 vs. 0.7460.2 for DENV-1 immunization and ADE tested against DENV-2 and 0.6460.22 vs. 0.6260.14 for DENV-2 immunization and ADE tested against DENV-1) ( Table 1 ). More importantly, we did not observe enhanced infection in vivo ( Fig. 2C and see later challenge experiments with a virulent DENV-2 strain). These data suggest that vaccination with the E216A/E217A mutants does not cause ADE during heterologous challenge even though lower neutralizing Ab titers are generated by the mutant strains compared to the wild-type virus. Recombinant MTases were assayed for GpppA-RNARm7GpppA-RNA and m7GpppA-RNARm7GpppAm-RNA conversions to indicate N7-and 29-Omethylation activities, respectively. The reactions were analyzed on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates [11] . Relative methylation activities were indicated below the TLC images with WT activity set as 100%. (C) Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA). BHK-21 cells were electroporated with equal amounts of WT and mutant genome-length RNAs of DENV-2. At indicated days post transfection, the cells were subjected to IFA using mouse antibody 4G2 against DENV E protein and anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FITC as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively [23] . (D) Plaque morphology. WT and mutant viruses recovered from genome-length RNA-transfected cells (passage 0), as well as the viruses after culturing on Vero cells for 10 rounds (passage 10) were analyzed by plaque assays [23] . Vaccinated mice generate a non-structural proteinspecific CD8 T cell response While antibodies are crucial to reduce the viral load by binding and neutralizing virus particles, T cells are necessary for efficient viral clearance [31, 32] . AG129 mice are not suitable to study T cell responses because of their lack of IFN-c signaling, which is critical to activate T cells. We therefore used IFNAR mice lacking the receptor for IFN-a/b [33] . IFNAR mice were immunized with 2.75610 5 Pfu DENV-2 E217A or DENV-2 WT and spleens were harvested at day 7 for restimulation in vitro and detection of IFN-c production (Fig. 3A ). Mutant and WT virus elicited a strong CD4 and CD8 T cell response after re-stimulation with DENV-2. The CD4 response was weaker in E217A-immunized mice, likely due to the lower total viral load in E217A-immunized mice compared to mice immunized with the WT virus (Fig. 3B ). To test for targeted DENV T cell response splenocytes were re-stimulated with a pool of NS4B and NS5 CD8 peptides described by Yauch et al [32] . No significant difference in the NS4B and NS5-specific T cell response was seen between mice immunized with E217A or WT DENV-2 ( Fig. 3B ). Taken together, DENV 29-O-MTase mutants induce a T cell response and epitope presentation that is similar to WT infection. Nevertheless, additional studies in mice and monkeys are necessary to assess the T cell response in greater detail and to test its functional contribution to protection.",21.61100057763312,14.347435774414329

To date, there is no specific treatment proven effective against this viral disease. In addition, no vaccine has been licensed to prevent MERS-CoV infection thus far. Therefore, our current review focuses on the most recent studies in search of an effective MERS vaccine. Overall, vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV are mainly based upon the viral spike (S) protein, due to its vital role in the viral infectivity, although several studies focused on other viral proteins such as the nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E) protein, and nonstructural protein 16 (NSP16) have also been reported. In general, the potential vaccine candidates can be classified into six types: viral vector-based vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, nanoparticle-based vaccine, inactivated-whole virus vaccine and liveattenuated vaccine, which are discussed in detail. Besides, the immune responses and potential antibody dependent enhancement of MERS-CoV infection are extensively reviewed.

In our study, we systematically screened the immunogenicity of rVSVs expressing a variety of ZIKV antigens including E, E truncations, aE, aE truncations, prM-E, prM-E truncations, prM-E-NS1, and NS1. To our knowledge, this is first time to utilize co-expression of NS1 with prM-E as potential antigens in vectored ZIKV vaccine candidates. In addition, we used viral MTase as a novel approach to attenuate VSV for delivering ZIKV vaccine. We demonstrated that a single immunization (IN or IM) with mtdVSV-based vaccine triggered high levels of ZIKV-specific Ab and T cell immune responses and provided complete protection against ZIKV challenges in both BALB/c and highly sensitive A129 mice. In contrast, DNA vaccine requires high doses and multiple booster vaccination, and antibody was undetectable in both BALB/c and A129 mice at early time points (Figs. 1, 5 , and Supplementary Table 1 ). Our results suggest that the efficacy of this VSV-based vaccine is much higher than a DNA vaccine. A VSV-based vaccine offers many other advantages, including genetic stability, expression of multiple antigens, low cost, simplicity of production, multiple routes of administration, and ease of manipulation. During the Ebola virus outbreaks in Africa in 2013-2016, VSV-based vaccine (rVSV-EBOV) was successfully used in humans and was found to be safe and efficacious [38] [39] [40] [41] . In addition, several other VSV-based vaccine candidates and oncolytic agents are being tested in human clinical trials. It is likely that more analysis of the safety and efficacy of VSV as a vector in humans will be forthcoming soon, which will facilitate the use of VSV-based vaccines in mass vaccination in the future. We found that ZIKV NS1 alone can induce partial protection against ZIKV challenge. In BALB/c mice, both rVSV-G1670A-NS1 and pCI-NS1 provided substantial protection against viremia in the absence of neutralizing antibody. Overall, the protective efficacy of mtdVSV-based NS1 vaccine (rVSV-G1670A-NS1) was higher than the DNA vaccine (pCI-NS1) approach. The partial protection of pCI-NS1 against lethal ZIKV challenge was also observed in A129 mice. Overall, the disease severity, viremia, and virus burden in pCI-NS1 vaccinated group were significantly lower than the pCI control group in A129 mice (P < 0.05), t-test (Figs. 6, 7) . The flavivirus NS1 is a nonstructural glycoprotein that is essential for viral replication and immune evasion. Previously, it was shown that immunization with purified NS1 and recombinant NS1 or passive administration of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against NS1 can protect mice against lethal infection by WNV, JEV, DENV, and YFV 23, 25, 44, 59, 60 . In addition, vaccination with DENV1, DENV3, or DENV4 NS1 provided substantial cross protection against a heterologous DENV2 lethal challenge 3 study did not evaluate the efficacy of MVA-ZIKV-NS1 in A129 mice which is more highly sensitive to ZIKV infection. The finding that NS1 conferred partial protection against ZIKV infection highlights an alternative strategy to design ZIKV vaccine. Current efforts on development of ZIKV subunit vaccines have been exclusively focused on prM and E proteins which rely on generating high levels of neutralizing Ab. However, it has been reported that anti-flavivirus Abs are cross-reactive with other species of flavivirus which may facilitate ZIKV infection through the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism 62-64 . Since NS1 is absent in the virion, Ab against NS1 will not neutralize ZIKV, but it may provide an alternative antigen for vaccine development because it avoids the potential risk of disease enhancement [65] [66] [67] .",24.39118305721674,13.878987820521768

Human polyclonal antibodies produced in transchromosomal bovines also protect mice from ZIKV lethal infection, eliminated ZIKV induced tissue damage in the brain and testes, and protected against testicular atrophy [45] . Thus, administration of therapeutic antibodies seems to also be a potential strategy against ZIKV. Nevertheless, it should be noted that, although still controvertial in the case of ZIKV infection [46] , the well-known antibody dependent enhancement effect (ADE) [47] , of which dengue virus (DENV) is the prototypic model, may potentiate the risk of disease exacerbation.",32.459923289731904,13.029970343788978

Here we further characterize a novel and robust DENV serotype 1 (DENV1) infectious clone system that can be used to support basic and applied research. We demonstrate how the system can be used to probe the antigenic relationships between strains by creating viable recombinant viruses that display or lack major antibody epitopes. The DENV1 clone system and recombinant viruses can be used to analyze existing vaccine immune responses and inform second-generation bivalent vaccine designs. KEYWORDS antibody, dengue, epitope, infectious clone D engue viruses (DENVs) represent a significant threat to human health and the global economy, causing widespread and frequent epidemics (1, 2) . Transmitted by female mosquitos, the DENV family has four known serotypes that are genetically and antigenically related. Infection with any one DENV serotype typically produces asymptomatic or mild disease but induces long-term immunity against that serotype (3) . However, subsequent exposure to a different serotype may result in more-severe disease characterized by dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome often attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (2, 4) .

The overexpression of mature GP1,2 on the plasma membrane results in the masking of antigenic epitopes on GP1,2 itself and the shielding of MHC-I and integrin β, leading to evasion of antiviral immunity. Steric shielding of surface epitopes by the heavily glycosylated GP impairs the recognition and killing of EBOV-infected cells by the natural killer and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell during an acute viral infection. It may also contribute to the persistent infection in the natural reservoir host to perpetuate the spread of the EBOV [99] [100] [101] . The sGP can evade host antibody-mediated response through ""antigenic subversion"" by eliciting non-neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with GP1,2. Thus, the massive secretion of sGP by the EBOV may prevent effective neutralization of the virus during an EBOV infection and reduce the effectiveness of vaccines that rely upon neutralizing antibody responses against GP1,2 [20, 21] . Some of the antibodies against GP1 may lead to enhancement of infectivity of the EBOV via interaction with complement component C1q, a phenomenon known as the antibody-dependent enhancement. The EBOV initiates infection by binding its GP1 to its specific human receptor sites on the surface of human cells. The interaction of C1q enhances binding between the virus-antibody complex and the C1q ligands on the cell surface, promoting interaction between the EBOV and its receptor. These infectivity-enhancing antibodies were virus species specific and were primarily correlated with immunoglobulin IgG2a and IgM levels, but not with IgG1 levels [102, 103] . The presence of infectivity-enhancing antibodies against GP1,2 in the EBOV infection raises concerns about the effectiveness of GP-based EBOV vaccines, and the use of passive prophylaxis or treatment with GP-based antibodies [104, 105] .",22.063069811982555,9.711062425407691

HSP90 and HSP70 are part of a receptor complex of DEN and are associated with membrane rafts essential for virus entry into neuroblastoma cells and human monocytes/macrophages [18, 19] . DC-SIGN is present in membrane rafts [61] , and neolactotetraosylceramide is a sphingolipid within membrane rafts. One of risk factors of hemorrhagic fever and fatal hemorrhagic shock syndrome after secondary infection with a serotype different from the primary infection is probably antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which can be explained by the hypothesis that preexisting nonneutralizing antibodies will generate immune complexes with a new serotype secondary-infecting DEN, leading to enhancement of the capacity to infect macrophages and other Fc Υ receptor-(Fc Υ -) bearing cells. The ADE of DEN-4 infection in the human myelomonocyte cell line U937 has been suggested to require membrane rafts [20] .

Most dengue-specific antibodies in human immune sera are weakly neutralizing and bind to multiple DENV serotypes. The human antibodies that potently and type specifically neutralize DENV represent a small fraction of the total DENV-specific antibody response. Moreover, these neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to novel epitopes including complex, quaternary epitopes that are only preserved on the intact virion. These studies establish that human and mouse antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the dengue virion.

Millions of people living in tropical and subtropical regions of the world are infected by DENV each year. Several hundred thousand of these infections progress to DHF, which is a life threatening disease [1] . The DENV complex consists of 4 distinct but related viruses designated as serotypes. DENVs display antibody epitopes that are unique to each serotype and epitopes that are shared between serotypes. People who have recovered from primary DENV infections develop robust antibody responses that cross react with the 4 serotypes. Despite the cross reactivity, antibodies only prevent re-infection by the same serotype (homologous serotype) and individuals are susceptible to a second infection with a different serotype (heterologous serotype) [2, 3] . People experiencing a secondary dengue infection with a new serotype face a much greater risk of developing DHF indicating that pre-existing immunity to DENV can exacerbate disease. Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV is the most widely supported theory explaining the higher risk of DHF associated with secondary infection [4] . Thus, the antibody response to DENV infection is complex, with potential to benefit or harm the host. Currently many dengue vaccines are under development including live attenuated DENV vaccines, which are entering phase III human trials. An in-depth understanding of the human antibody response to DENV is highly relevant to evaluating vaccines already in the pipeline and for developing new vaccines.

However, subunit vaccines often show insufficient efficacy. Structure-based vaccine designs have been intensively pursued to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines, aiding battles against various viral diseases (24) (25) (26) . In these vaccine designs, the envelope proteins of HIV, influenza virus, and non-ZIKV flaviviruses are modified to preserve specific neutralizing epitopes while subtracting or masking epitopes that potentially induce antibody-dependent enhancement effects or other unfavorable immune responses (24, 25, 27, 28) . Trying to understand the generally low efficacy of viral subunit vaccines, we recently identified an intrinsic limitation of recombinant subunit vaccines, using Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as a model system. That is, subunit vaccines are part of a large viral envelope protein or a virus particle, and hence much of their surface areas are buried; however, when a recombinant subunit vaccine is made, the previously buried surface areas become artificially exposed, and they contain immunodominant nonneutralizing epitopes that distract the host immune system from reacting to neutralizing epitopes (29) . We also developed a neutralizing immunogenicity index (NII) to quantitatively characterize the contribution of each of these epitopes to the overall immunogenicity of the subunit vaccine (29) . In spite of their initial success in MERS-CoV subunit vaccine designs, the concept of the intrinsic limitation of viral subunit vaccines and the strategy of using NII to quantitatively characterize epitopes have not been extended to subunit vaccine designs targeting another virus.",22.687576675690035,12.066284206009792

Fcγ receptor bearing human cell lines such as monocytes and macrophages, which are not efficiently infected with DENV alone, become highly permissive to infection in the presence of sub-neutralizing antibody concentrations. ADE has been well demonstrated with monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera in vitro using Fcγ receptor bearing human cells such as K562, U937, and primary human monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Initially it was believed that ADE simply resulted from a greater number of infected cells producing more infectious virions (extrinsic ADE). However, recent studies by Ubol and colleagues with THP-1 cells (a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) indicate that the phenomenon is more complex [95] . DENVs entering THP-1 cells via Fc receptors suppressed type I interferon responses and the activation of cellular antiviral molecules more effectively than DENV infecting the same cells in the absence of antibody [95] [96] [97] . Moreover, THP1 cells infected in the presence of antibody produced more infectious virus per infected cell compared to cells infected in the absence of antibody. This phenomenon, which has been termed ""intrinsic ADE"" demonstrates that antibody mediated infection leads to a suppression of the antiviral state within the infected cell and the release of a greater quantity of infectious virions by each infected cell compared to cells infected by antibody-independent entry. Ubol's observations about intrinsic ADE have been confirmed by other groups working with primary human cells, although the specific mechanisms and molecules implicated appear to depend on the cell type being used or other variables introduced by the different laboratories performing these studies [98] [99] [100] . With THP-1 cells, antibody dependent infections inhibited type I interferon responses and increased levels of the suppressive cytokine IL-10 [97] . In studies with primary human PBMCs, one group did not observe any differences in type Type I IFN or IL-10 levels [99] whereas another group observed decreased levels of type I interferon and increased levels of IL-6 [100] . Boonak and colleagues compared ADE infections in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells and observed increased IL10 production in primary monocytes but not in macrophage or dendritic cells [98] . The picture emerging from these studies is that antibody-complexed dengue viruses infecting cells via Fcγ receptors leads to the suppression of cellular antiviral responses but further studies are needed to better define the cellular pathways and mechanisms that contribute to this phenotype.",21.15517714337877,9.71401644697517

The most compelling evidence for ADE has come from studies with infants, who have passively acquired antibodies to DENV from their mothers [85] [86] [87] . Soon after birth high levels of maternal antibodies appear to protect infants from dengue. Infants born to dengue immune mothers are at greatest risk of developing severe dengue between 6-12 months after birth and this has been attributed to maternal antibody decaying to low, sub-neutralizing levels that enhance DENV. Studies with older children experiencing secondary infections also provide evidence in support of ADE and severe disease. In one study, the ability of immune sera collected just before a second infection to enhance DENV in cell culture was positively correlated with risk of severe disease [88] . However, not all human studies support the ADE theory of DHF/DSS. For instance, in their study with maternally transferred antibodies in infants, Libraty et al. [80] did not find a significant association of ADE with the disease outcome. In a prospective study with school children in Thailand, ADE activity of pre-illness undiluted sera did not correlate with the severe disease severity or viral load following secondary infections [89] . While it is difficult to directly compare different studies because of differences in study design and methods, the ADE hypothesis is biologically plausible and supported by sufficient evidence to justify conducting more human cohort studies specifically designed to test the ADE hypothesis.",17.625552728315796,8.92042153089167

Taken together, this study has given insight into the molecular events following SARS-CoV infection as well as identified an imperative signature for immunological protection against SARS-CoV in both a reinfection and vaccination model. Specifically, the ferret model of SARS-CoV infection showed a two step temporal paradigm of host immune responses in the lung. SARS-CoV infection in the ferrets was characterized by an early innate immune response (robust IFN and chemokine gene expression) followed by adaptive immunity likely eliciting localized anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and protective immune responses. Likewise, the lack of repeat robust innate immune responses in ferrets when reinfected with SARS-CoV suggested that the postreinfection gene signatures may reveal immune correlates related to successful immunization that may be applied to future use of the ferret model of SARS infection in vaccination strategies. Thus, the identified IRGs have the potential to be inverse correlates of immunity against acute SARS-CoV infection versus reinfection, or SARS-CoV vaccination versus challenge.

Several laboratories around the globe are working at an unprecedented pace to develop a SARS vaccine utilizing essentially two different types of SARS-CoV-derived immunogens, 1) inactivated whole virus, and 2) SARS-CoV encoded N and S proteins using recombinant DNA methods. The possibility of producing an engineered live, attenuated SARS-CoV has also been considered. Takasuka et al (2004) have reported that subcutaneous administration of UV-inactivated purified SARS-CoV virion elicits a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in long-term antibody secretion and memory B cells [60] . The antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the virus. The inactivated virus also induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production upon restimulation with inactivated virus in vitro [60] . These studies suggest that whole-killed virion may have the potential as a candidate antigen for SARS vaccine to elicit both humoral and cellular immunity. When SARS-CoV inactivated by beta-propiolactone was used as antigen in mice and rabbits, the animals elicited antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) present in the S1 region of SARS-CoV.

Depletion of RBD-specific antibodies from patient or rabbit immune sera by immunoadsorption, significantly reduced the virus neutralizing ability of the sera, suggesting that the RBD epitope in the S protein is a critical determinant in developing vaccine strategies [62] .",12.932991189293492,8.786351784950842

Clinical studies documented side effects associated with the rVSVΔG-based vaccine, including post-vaccination arthritis, detection of vector RNA in blood, and infectious vaccine virus in the skin of vaccinated individuals 122,123 . Animal studies were not always in line with Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine clinical trials, suggesting that immune correlates of protection are not universal and depend on vaccine platform, vaccine regimen, host genetics, pre-existing immunity, immunization schedule, and challenge protocol 124 .

The second rVSV-based LASV vaccine candidate supported by CEPI is based on the VesiculoVax platform licensed by Profectus BioSciences. This platform was developed to further improve the safety of the rVSV vector by N gene translocation and truncation of VSV-G cytoplasmic tail (CT1). The attenuated rVSV-N4CT1 vector was immunogenic in NHPs and induced only a mild inflammatory response after intra-thalamic inoculation 125 . This vector was used to generate experimental vaccines expressing single or multiple GPs that protected NHPs against EBOV and MARV challenges 126-128 , but there are no peer-reviewed pre-clinical data in support of the LASV vaccine based on the VesiculoVax platform.

As these responses against OppA were significant in comparison to the negative responses following the first vaccinations, this is evidence of a secondary immune response as a result of immune memory. If memory cells are produced after the initial contact with an antigen, subsequent exposure to the same antigen will allow the host to recognize the antigen faster, and with greater magnitude (49, 50) . The responses elicited by the DNA vaccines were, however, dose dependent as well as vector dependent since different results were produced by each vaccine when using the same dose. This highlights a possible role of the vaccine vector in the observed antibody responses. The VR1020_oppA vaccine, on average, elicited higher titer values compared to the pCI-neo_oppA vaccine, which might be due to the TPA signal sequence of the VR1020 plasmid, which is situated upstream of the oppA gene, and assists with protein expression in mammalian cells and export of the protein out of the cell. This would in turn increase the immunogenicity of the antigen (45) . In addition to this, sequences in the plasmid backbone have intrinsic immunostimulatory activity which enhance the immune system's response to the expressed protein antigen (51, 52) .",13.23708164553031,8.321120899429566

Flaviviruses are a genus in the Flaviviridae family and include important emerging and resurgent human pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and yellow fever virus [2, 4] . Flaviviruses are transmitted by insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, and can cause severe human diseases characterized by encephalitis, meningitis, and hemorrhages [2, 3] . More than one third of the world's population lives in dengue fever endemic areas, and there are an estimated 50-100 million cases of dengue infection and 500,000 cases of the more lethal complication, dengue hemorrhagic fever, per year [5, 6, 7, 8] . There are currently no antiviral therapies for flaviviruses. DENV vaccine development is underway but is problematic due to the presence of four DENV serotypes and the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement of infection [2, 6, 9, 10] .

Substantial anti-RSV T-cell priming and B-cell responses were observed in mice receiving RSV-ICs, resulting in predominant Th1-type CD4 + T-cell response and IgG2c antibody responses. Importantly, the ICs also primed anti-RSV CD8 + T cells. These data have important implications for the prophylaxis and treatment of pediatric RSV infections. Nevertheless, interactions between ICs and neonatal versus adult innate and adaptive immune systems still need to be investigated because mouse studies have revealed potential antibody-induced neonatal autoimmunity in certain settings. 85, 86 ICS AND IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION In the course of viral infections, the formation of ICs composed of viral determinants and the resulting host humoral responses can potentially produce deleterious effects. Persistent ICs are formed in a variety of chronic viral infections and may lead to unregulated and protracted FcγR signaling. This may lead to immune dysfunction instead of stimulating antiviral immune responses. In this regard, the high levels of ICs formed during LCMV infection interfere with FcγR-mediated activities. 87, 88 These endogenously formed ICs were shown to outcompete the effector functions of exogenously administered therapeutic mAbs, in particular binding to FcγRs expressed by immune cells. Persistent endogenous ICs are also linked to dysfunctional B-cell responses in HIV infection, including the suppression of antiviral IgA responses and impaired production of neutralizing antibodies (reviewed in Moir et al. 89 ). The composition of ICs might also negatively affect the efficiency of the antiviral immune response. For instance, the composition of ICs has been shown to be dynamic throughout the course of HIV infections due to changes in both antibody specificities and virion levels. Notably, circulating ICs are initially comprised of antibodies that opsonize both infectious and non-infectious virions. This results in a decrease in the availability of antibodies able to blunt viral propagation. This phenomenon probably contributes to the reduced efficiency of the antibodies generated during acute infection. 90 Changes in circulating ICs have also been reported in HCV infections. The level of circulating ICs is low in acutely infected patients, whereas chronically infected individuals show a high proportion of immunocomplexed HCV, raising the possibility that ICs may have a role in the pathogenesis of HCV, namely liver damage. 91 Moreover, the formation of ICs with non-neutralizing antibodies may also lead to the antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection of FcγR-expressing cells. This happens in several viral infections, including those by the dengue virus. [92] [93] [94] [95] Along this line, the binding of ICs to FcγRs on monocytes/macrophages can paradoxically suppress innate immunity, induce IL-10 production and bias responses from Th1 toward Th2. This in turn leads to the increased infectious outputs by infected cells via intrinsic antibodydependent enhancement. 94, 96 Finally, ICs have also been reported to have a role in increasing viral loads in the context of gene transfer-based vaccination strategies. In the STEP HIV-1 vaccine trial, which evaluated a replication-defective adenovirus type 5 vector vaccine, the ICs formed with pre-existing anti-Adv5 antibodies improved the environment for HIV-1 replication in T cells. This may have been due to the IC-driven activation of a DC-T-cell axis that induces the activation of CD4 + T cells and leads to a permissive environment for HIV-1 infection. This environment probably explains the increased propagation of HIV-1 infection among adenovirus type 5-seropositive vaccine recipients. 97 ",19.443041092386764,12.406769206306162

Up to 50,000 human cases of JE are reported annually in Asian countries, of which 10,000-15,000 result in fatality [1] . A high proportion (nearly 50%) of survivors, especially young children and those greater than 65 years of age, exhibit permanent neurologic and psychiatric sequelae. A wide range of animals including swine, equines and birds can also be infected. Pigs, as well as birds, serve as amplifying and reservoir hosts [2, 3] . Further, JEV infection has accounted for significant economic losses in the pig industry due to fetal encephalitis and reproductive failure in pregnant sows and hypospermia in boars [4] . There is no specific treatment available for JE, and vaccination is the only effective way to prevent JEV infection in humans and domestic animals. JEV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity against JE [5, 6] . Further, like other flaviviruses, NS1 is able to elicit protective immunity without the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement. These characteristics make NS1 an attractive alternative immunogen. As such, much research is currently being devoted to NS1-based vaccine development [7, 8, 9] .

Similar expression of CCL2, CCL7 and CCL20 was detected comparing infected SCID controls and GKO recipients; by contrast CCL2 and CCL7 were upregulated and CCL20 downregulated in recipients of WT CD4 + T cells ( Figure 7A) . These data suggest that in contrast to EAE, CCL2, CCL7 and CCL20 chemokine expression is regulated by IFN-γ rather that IL-17 during JHMV infection. Moreover, no significant difference in CXCL2 mRNA was found comparing SCID-infected controls and recipients of either WT or GKO CD4 + T cells ( Figure 7A) , supporting CXCL1 as the major neutrophil chemoattractant during JHMV infection. CNS infection with JHMV induces a limited number of MMPs, that is, MMP9, MMP3 and MMP12 [46] . As MMP9 is specifically expressed by neutrophils [47] , abundant neutrophil recruitment in the CNS of GKO T cell recipients (whether or not treated with anti-IL17) correlated with MMP9 expression ( Figure 7B ). MMP3 and MMP12 mRNA expression were also upregulated in GKO recipients compared to infected SCID controls and WT recipients, suggesting a potential role of these MMPs in GKO mortality by mediating tissue destruction ( Figure 7B) . However, survival of GKO recipients treated with anti-IL17 also expressed increased MMP3 and MMP12 mRNA ( Figure 7B ), suggesting that MMP3 and MMP12 play no role in the early mortality of GKO recipients. Finally, to investigate a potential contribution of GM-CSF to the rapid disease progression, relative levels of GM-CSF were measured in the CNS of SCID-infected controls, and recipients of WT and GKO CD4 + T cells. GM-CSF mRNA expression was increased in GKO recipients relative to controls and WT CD4 + T cell recipients. These data were reminiscent of enhanced GM-CSF expression by Th17 compared to Th1 cells in EAE [27] and suggested a potentially detrimental role during JHMV encephalomyelitis.

There is no direct evidence of ADE linked to SARS-CoV infection in humans to date, and infection of human macrophages with SARS-CoV was previously shown to be abortive [25] . However, it was recently shown, in a viral pseudotype assay expressing the full-length spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoVlike viruses, that these cannot be neutralized with either homologous or heterologous mouse immune sera, and that both the sera and human mAbs neutralizing SARS-CoV enhance infectivity of the pseudotype for the human adenocarcinoma cells used as indicator system [34] .

We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. Methods: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chimeric constructs of fragment crystallizable γ receptors (FcγR), which bind antibody-coated pathogens. Results: We show here that anti-Spike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp). Macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, however, did not support productive replication of the virus. Purified anti-viral IgGs, but not other soluble factor(s) from heat-inactivated mouse immune serum, were sufficient to enhance infection. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on signaling-competent members of the human FcγRII family, which were shown to confer susceptibility to otherwise naïve ST486 cells, as binding of immune complexes to cell surface FcγRII was necessary but not sufficient to trigger antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Furthermore, only FcγRII with intact cytoplasmic signaling domains were competent to sustain ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection, thus providing additional information on the role of downstream signaling by FcγRII.

Our previous results demonstrated that only FcγRIIA and, to a lesser extent, FcγRIIB1 triggered infection by SARS-CoVpp in presence of anti-Spike serum [16] . Although it would have been desirable to perform FcγR blocking experiments also in macrophages, coexpression of all FcγRs in these cells [29, 30] However, the relationship between internalization of immune complexes and ADE of infection by SARS-CoV via FcγRIIs appears to be a complex process. Thus, FcγRIIB2 has been shown to mediate internalization of immune complexes at a faster rate than FcγRIIA [33] , whereas we found that ADE of infection via FcγRIIA was more prominent than with FcγRIIB. Recently, involvement of downstream signaling triggered by FcγRs activation has been evaluated with respect to ADE of dengue virus infection [34] . Thus, abrogation of FcγRI and FcγRII signaling competency was associated with significant impairment of phagocytosis, but only the signaling-incompetent FcγRI become unable to trigger ADE of dengue virus. Conversely, no discernible effect on dengue virus immune complex infectivity was observed for both wild type and signaling incompetent FcγRIIA. These findings point to fundamental differences between FcγRIA and FcγRIIA with respect to their immuneenhancing capabilities and suggest that different mechanisms of dengue virus immune complex internalization may operate between these FcγRs [34] .",32.07341530661424,16.231911299220958

Previous studies have demonstrated ADE in vitro due to FccR-or complement-mediated mechanisms or to modulation of the interaction of gp120 with CCR5 [52, 53, 54] . Here we demonstrate that enhancement in vitro occurs at the level of transcytosis across epithelial cells and involves FcRn. In vivo, Ig isotype, as well as neutralizing activity, are likely to play a determining role in whether an antibody might protect from or enhance infection. As demonstrated recently, intrarectally applied dIgA1 HGN194 mAb, but less so the IgG1 version, prevented SHIV infection following intrarectal challenge [40] . In vitro, the dIgA1 inhibited transcytosis, whereas we now show that the IgG1 version enhances transcytosis at pH 6.0. Another study showed that, compared to irrelevant-and no-antibody controls, there was an increase in the number of transmitted/founder SHIV variants when vaginal challenge followed systemic or local infusion of a non-neutralizing IgG1 mAb [55] . Clearly, other studies have found that IgG with neutralizing activity can prevent lentivirus infection after vaginal challenge [56, 57] . Thus, whereas a strong vaccine-induced neutralizing IgG response may protect, nonneutralizing IgG or waning titers of neutralizing IgG present in an acidic lumen might enhance transcytosis across mucosal barriers while allowing infection of susceptible target cells. However, whether an antibody protects, enhances or has no effect is likely to depend on the potency and breadth of antiviral activity, the viral strain, the inflammatory state of the exposed individual, and genetic factors-such as FccR polymorphisms-that might influence antibody function [58] . Finally, if FcRn-mediated transcytosis applies in vivo, our results would strengthen the argument for a mucosal IgA response to vaccination-though not at the exclusion of a strong IgG neutralizing or other anti-viral response-since IgA can inhibit transcytosis, would not engage FcRn, and mediates only uni-directional translocation of immune complexes from the subepithelial space into external secretions [40, 59] .",34.58342895403503,14.893045386902983

Therefore, we explored the immunogenic and protective potential of VSV replicon particles as a vectored vaccine approach against PRRSV. Such VRP were successfully used before as efficacious experimental vaccines against SARS, IAV and BTV [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . In the present study, VSV replicons were engineered to express PRRSV structural proteins, individually or in combination (Table 1) . Emphasis was on GP5, M, GP4 and GP3, since these proteins are important targets for neutralizing and protective antibodies [11, 23, 26, 27] , with the major neutralizing epitopes residing on GP5 [18] . Since several studies have shown that co-expression of PRRSV antigens resulted in better humoral and cellular immune responses than expression of the individual proteins [30, 60] , GP5, M, GP4, GP3 and GP2 proteins were co-expressed to partly mimic the formation of the GP5/M and GP4/3/2 oligomers. Vaccination of pigs with VRP expressing two or five PRRSV envelope proteins in total did not result in any significant reduction of viremia compared with the control group. A tendency for reduced PRRSV-related inflammatory responses was observed only when all five proteins were expressed. Interestingly, vaccination with GP5/M induced fever up to 41.5 °C for 1 day following challenge infection with PRRSV Olot/91 whereas mockvaccinated pigs remained asymptomatic. Fever was less pronounced when all envelope proteins were included in the vaccine. Enhanced disease following vaccination with recombinant GP5 and M was observed previously [42, 61] . This was attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease during natural infection, which is probably mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies [26, 62] . Such antibodies were shown to increase virus infection in porcine alveolar macrophage cultures and in vivo [62] involving different FcγR isoforms [63, 64] .",20.05804060135044,13.005673950729918

These titers were comparable to those induced by Ebola VLPs in mice 16 , or by chimeric hPIV3 bearing the EBOV GP in guinea pigs 8 . Antibodies elicited by BC-PIV/EBOV-GP also induced antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) 17 of pseudotyped EBOV infection (Fig. 5c ). The ADE activities induced by BC-PIV/EBOV GP were also comparable to those induced by Ebola VLPs in mice 16 and those of the sera from monkeys that survived challenge with EBOV 16 . A sufficient neutralizing activity of the sera indicates that the ADE effects were overcome by the inhibitory effects of the sera in virus infection. Replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)/EBOV-GP was previously reported to protect against lethal EBOV challenge in nonhuman primates 7, 18 , thereby CD4+ T cell-depleted animals succumbed to EBOV infection due to a lack of induction of specific antibodies while the CD8+ T cell-depleted ones survived 19 . These findings suggested that antibodies play an important role in VSV/EBOV-GP-mediated protection against EBOV challenge.

For the outside version, the M2e peptide gene was fused with the HN gene in the hPIV2 genome and used to produce the recombinant vectors in the Vero/ BC-F cells or genetically modified Vero cells expressing M2e-fused F protein. Since F and HN proteins are oppositely oriented across the viral membrane, these strategies work (Fig. 1b,d) . The M2e peptide was detected by a Western blot analysis in each case (Fig. 1d) . The bands of the inside peptide are more abundant than those of the outside peptide. This may have resulted from differences in the expression of these peptides: the inside peptide was derived from its abundant and stable expression in the packaging cells, while the outside peptide was derived from transcripts from the vector.

In contrast, there are some examples that closely mimics hallmarks of natural host disease such as the case of CCFHV infections, where proinflammatory host responses, severe thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy are observed; BTV infection, that leads to damage in lung and lymphoid organs and alteration in the level of blood parameters; or CHIKV, that exhibits a marked tropism for skeletal muscles, joints and skin, that constitute the classical symptomatology and organ affectation in the natural hosts. In some other cases, this model was useful to study various important phenomena of disease, as the role of type I IFN responses to control the access to the CNS, as the case of WNV, the study of the sexual and vertical transmission of ZIKV or the antibody dependent enhancement mediated by sub-neutralizing antibodies during secondary DENV infections.",20.83322770555469,10.763647032835864

Dengue Fever virus is the etiologic agent of the self-limited febrile illness dengue fever (DF), as well as the potentially lethal severe dengue disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, DHF/DSS). Symptomatic infections are characterized by: fever, retro-orbital headache, muscle, joint and bone pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, mucosal bleeding, and thrombocytopenia. In the most severe form of the disease, severe bleeding, organ dysfunction, vascular permeability, and shock can occur. Replication of DENV has been tested in immunocompetent mice [82] . C57BL/6 mice infected with DENV-1 strain Mochizuki presented some signs of dengue disease such as thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, liver damage, and increase production of IFNγ and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) cytokines. However, no changes in CD4 and CD8 populations were observed comparing infected and mock infected groups. In addition, this strain was propagated in newborn (1 to 2 days old) Swiss mice, by intracerebral (ic) inoculation of infected cell culture supernatant. This propagation method resulted in a neurological disease phenotype that is unlike the multi-organ involvement typically observed in clinical dengue infections [44] . Although this DENV strain induce detectable viremia in C57BL/6 strain, the overwhelming majority of immunocompetent mouse models do not result in clinical signs of dengue infection [44] . To overcome this issue, a pathological analysis were performed in IFNAR(−/−) mice. It has been shown that mortality rates depend on the DENV serotype and strain used [44] . A severe dengue-like disease is observed when animals are infected with sufficiently high DENV2 challenge doses and clearance of DENV from the central nervous system (CNS) and prevention of paralysis in this mouse model has been confirmed to be dependent of CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ response [45] . Most primary DENV infections with any serotype are asymptomatic or lead to the self-limited febrile illness DF, in patients infected with DENV. However, secondary infection with a different DENV serotype leads to increased risk of developing severe dengue disease [47] . This increase in severity upon secondary infection is thought to be mediated in part via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), whereby interaction between antibodies generated during a prior infection and the current infecting serotype can lead to increased uptake of virus via Fc receptors expressed on susceptible myeloid cells [46] . This phenomena was observed also in IFNAR(−/−) mice, with a dramatic increase in the mortality rate in individuals intraperitonially (ip) injected with anti-E mAb 4G2 24 h before challenge [48] . Additionally, another study published in 2009 revealed the important role for CD8+ T cells in the host defense against DENV, demonstrating that the anti-DENV CD8+ T cell response can be enhanced by immunization. This study identified DENV-specific CD8 T cell epitopes, and peptide vaccination with these epitopes resulted in enhanced control of DENV infection and viral load [83] . Another immunization study has been performed in this model using live attenuated dengue vaccine 2 -o-methyltransferase mutants, eliciting a strong adaptive immune response [84] .",19.108886974325905,9.781612974449889

These signal molecules can elicit a more robust immune response via activation of innate immune pathway (Coffman et al., 2010) . Various strategies have been adopted to increase the immunological efficacy of the inactivated viral emulsified vaccine, such as the addition of the immunopotentiators (Fox et al., 2013) . The adjuvant, CVCVA5, showed the effects on improving efficacy of both the serum and mucosal antibody response and the cell mediated immune response of inactivated vaccine in chickens (Tang et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2016) . The components of CVCVA5 contain ligands to pattern recognition receptors, poly I:C, resiquimod, imiquimod, muramyldipeptide (MDP), and chemicals with immune enhancement activity, levamisole hydrochloride. The poly I:C is the ligand of toll-like-receptors (TLRs)-3 and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR). While the resiquimod, imiquimod are the ligands of TLR-7/8 (Vasilakos and Tomai, 2013) .

The virus can infect more varieties of ducks such as Beijing duck, golden duck, Shaoxing duck, Cherry Valley, Campbell ducks, Jinyun duck, etc. Laying ducks infected mainly demonstrated drops in egg production, follicular rupture and bleeding, and yolk peritonitis. Ducklings mainly displayed standing instability and paralysis, retarded growth, with 10 to 30% mortality rates [2, 3] . Other birds such as Chickens, geese, sparrows, etc were also infected and displayed obvious clinical signs [4] [5] [6] . So far, the disease has resulted in a great economic loss to the poultry industry and caused wide public concern. There is no specific treatment available for TMUV and the vaccination is an effective way to prevent TMUV infection in waterfowl. The inactivated vaccines and live attenuated vaccines against PLOS TMUV have been successfully developed and already used in clinical production [7, 8] . But the live attenuated vaccines could display disadvantages of reversion of virulence and spread, and the inactivated vaccines didn't display an effective cellular immunity. So the development of a new type of vaccine is very urgent. TMUV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which belongs to the Ntaya virus group within flavivirus genus, flaviviridae family [9] . TMUV genome encodes a single polyprotein which is cleaved into three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [3] . Among them, NS1 protein is a glycoprotein which is present in cell-surface or in the form of cell-associated protein [10] . NS1 protein possesses several unusual and interesting performances which is closely related to the membrane function and indispensable in the early viral replication, assembly and release of the virus [11] . NS1 protein contains multiple protective T-cell and B-cell epitopes which can induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity without the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement [12, 13] . The B-cell epitopes mainly refer to multiple continuous amino acid residues on the protein surface or the spatial conformation of discontinuous amino acid residues. Accurate analysis of the epitopes on NS1 protein is critical for further understanding the mechanism of NS1-mediated immune protection. In recent years, epitope-based marker vaccines have increasingly attracted wide attentions in public [14] . The identification of linear epitopes on NS1 protein would be conducive to the development of epitope-based marker and subunit vaccines, preparation of protective antibodies and understanding protein functions [15] .",14.74816215770145,6.7909134592398495

Each vaccine type has different advantages and disadvantages. For instance, inactivated and liveattenuated virus-based vaccines are vaccine types developed using the most traditional approaches. Although they generally induce highly potent immune responses and/or protection, the possibility for incomplete inactivation of viruses or recovering virulence exists, resulting in significant safety concerns (Zhang et al., 2014) . Also, these traditional vaccines may induce the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2018b) . Similarly, some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection, but they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity, causing some harmful immune responses. Instead, DNA and nanoparticle vaccines maintain strong safety profile; however, the immunogenicity of these vaccines is usually lower than that of virus-or viral vector-based vaccines, often requiring optimization of sequences, components, or immunization routes, inclusion of appropriate adjuvants, or application of combinational immunization approaches (Zhang et al., 2014) .",32.628781321018046,15.379871917594658

The prM protein has been shown to serve as a chaperon of E protein [28, 29] and to prevent E protein from premature fusion within acidic compartments along the secretary pathway [30, 31] . While a previous study reported a protective role of anti-prM antibodies against DENV infection in mice [32] , recent studies showed that anti-prM mAbs neutralize DENV poorly and potently enhanced the infection of immature DENV particles by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [33] [34] [35] , suggesting anti-prM responses should be minimized in dengue vaccines [35] . Due to the inefficient cleavage of prM protein on DENV virions [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , the presence of prM protein in DENV vaccine preparation (live attenuated or killed virus vaccine) could represent enhancing epitopes and be potentially harmful [35] .

However since 2007, large epidemics of Asian genotype ZIKV have been reported around the world [4, 5] . Recently it is estimated that one-third of the world population might be at risk of infection [6] . The rapid rise in ZIKA infection is compounded by the ease of vertical [7] and sexual human-to-human transmissions [8] . Recent studies have associated ZIKV infection with other diseases: Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly in newborn infants of mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy [7, [9] [10] [11] , thrombocytopenia [12] , multipleorgan failures [13] , and possibly male infertility [14] . Consequently WHO has declared a public health emergency for ZIKV infection [15] . ZIKV represents a significant challenge to the public health of the whole world but unfortunately there is no available effective vaccine or therapy so far. ZIKV has a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of 10.7 kb, belongs to the flavivirus genus which also contains viruses causing dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis [6, 16] . ZIKV shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology with other flaviviruses particularly dengue virus, thus resulting in immunological cross-reactivity [17] . Current Zika outbreaks are largely localized within dengue-endemic areas, it is thus proposed that preexisting dengue-induced antibodies may enhance Zika infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a factor that makes the vaccine approaches extremely challenging [17] . While several recent studies focused on the possibility of developing neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV [18] [19] [20] , it may take quite a while before such neutralizing antibodies for ZIKV enter clinical trials.",31.481241871932227,12.625994853185293

Interaction between CD300a and its ligands results in SHP-1 recruitment for suppression of NK cell-mediated cytolysis in tumor cells [7] and inhibition of FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation [6] . CD300a also serves as an attachment factor for dengue virus (DENV) and enhances DENV infection in primary macrophages [8] . It is likely that CD300a recognizes PE on the virion surface, possibly acquired when DENV buds from the endoplasmic reticulum during replication. Because CD300a has been shown to inhibit toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent inflammatory pathways [9] , ligation of CD300a by DENV could inhibit or delay innate immune response against infection. DENV is also known to ligate leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1 (LILRB1) [10] , an inhibitory receptor expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and subsets of NK, B, and T cells [11] . Binding of LILRB1 to its natural ligand, major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) molecules, leads to recruitment of SHP-1 and potentiates negative feedback mechanisms such as inhibition of B cell receptor signaling and inhibition of cell killing by NK and T cells [11] . During antibody-enhanced DENV infection, non-or sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies form immune complexes with DENV, which are taken up via activating FcγRs on myeloid cells [12] . This phenomenon, also known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), is postulated to explain the heightened risk of severe dengue following secondary infection. Ligation of activating FcγRs by antibody-opsonized DENV leads to Syk and STAT-1 phosphorylation, activating transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), known to inhibit viral replication [13] . Unlike its interaction with CD300a, co-ligation of LILRB1 does not alter the rate of viral entry. Instead, co-ligation of LILRB1 by DENV resulted in SHP-1 recruitment, dephosphorylation of Syk, and down-regulation of ISGs, which permits successful viral replication during ADE (Fig 1A) [10] .",31.922566837691477,12.463591118969642

CTL response against influenza virus infection is reduced in aging populations. While young BALB/c mounted strong cytolytic response with no discernible differences in intensity to flu NP antigen following inoculation of live, killed H1N1 virus, or a preparation of the virus plus a NP-specific antibody, only the IC significantly restored the same response in the aged mice. This enhanced killing was associated with increased IFN-c production in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells . Due to its rapid spread and high rate of mutagenesis, the emphasis of influenza infection control has been to generate bNAbs against conserved regions of hemagglutinin (HA) (Okuno et al, 1993 (Okuno et al, , 1994 Ekiert et al, 2011) . One version of the antibody, CT149, targeting the stem region of HAs of both type I and type II isolates blocked the membrane fusion. In addition, the binding by this antibody induced FccR-dependent ADCC, suggesting the involvement of ICs (Wu et al, 2015) . For Ebola infection, several B-cell clones of highly potent GP-specific neutralizing antibodies from a disease survivor have been tested. These antibodies also mediated ADCC via FccR as mutants in the Fc that interfered with the receptor binding lost the cytotoxicity (Corti et al, 2016) . Francisella tularensis (FT) is the causative pathogen of tularemia. DCs coated with monoclonal antibody-treated FT delivered intranasally protected hosts from subsequent challenges. This effect was not affected by the absence of FccRIIb, suggesting a preferential engagement of activating FccRs (Pham et al, 2014) . In malaria infection, it was found that the FccR binding was critical for the uptake of IC (McClintock et al, 2005) . In one study, the mortality of Plasmodium berghei infection that is often lethal was prevented if the antiserum from immune mice was transferred into infected mice. This protection was eliminated in the absence of FccR c-chain (Pleass, 2009 ). In addition, Phoolcharoen et al transiently expressed Ebola virus GP1 glycoprotein fused to an antibody heavy chain from a humanized GP1-specific antibody in Nicotiana benthamiana (tobacco plant). The purified fusion protein induced high titers of Ebolaspecific IgG antibodies, similar to those induced by GP1 virus-like particles, suggesting a scheme of vastly increased production capacity for IC preparations (Phoolcharoen et al, 2011) . Urgent productions of ICs to protect populations under threat from rapidly emerging viral infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are also being tested . Although ICs are in general considered to be conducive to antiviral immunity, it should be noted that in some cases the presence of virus-specific antibodies can increase infectivity, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection (Tirado & Yoon, 2003) . In the STEP trials, HIV gag, pol, and nef gene cassettes were inserted into the adeno vector, however individuals with preexisting immunity against the virus showed greater risk of HIV infection following the immunization (Buchbinder et al, 2008) . The same adverse effect was seen for additional viruses, such as dengue (Goncalvez et al, 2007) , measles (Iankov et al, 2006) , and over a dozen others (Suhrbier & La Linn, 2003) .

Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) have been demonstrated to have a major role in antibody efficacy [128, 129] . Unfortunately, antibody treatment of patients with malignant tumors may not achieve therapeutic effect due to immune suppression, immune escape, complement inhibition etc. ADCs offer the possibility to overcome this issue by enhancing cytotoxicity to cancer cells, thereby reducing undesired side effects.

Each experiment, with positive and negative controls, was performed with the same stock concentration of virus. After incubation at 37°C for 2 hours, 5 x10 4 (THP-1) or 6 x10 4 (primary monocytes) of CD4-blocked cells were added to each well with final volume 40 to 200 μl each, then spinoculated at 1200 g for 1 hour at 4°C. CD4 blocking was performed in order to reduce background levels of virus internalization due to Env-CD4 interactions, and blocking was achieved by pre-treating the cells at 10 x10 6 cells/ml with 20 μg/ml anti-human CD4 antibody (clone SK3) (Biolegend) for 15 minutes at 4°C before adding them to the antibody-beads/virus mixture. Nevertheless, similar patterns of antibody-dependent signals were observed when sCD4 blocking was omitted from the experimental setup. Following spinoculation, antigens/viruses and cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for phagocytosis/virion internalization. After incubation, supernatant was removed and cells were washed with PBS. Cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. To calculate phagocytosis scores for both the bead based phagocytosis assay and the virion internalization assay, a cutoff was first assigned based on the 95 th percentile of the no-antibody control. For each sample, the % of cells above this cutoff was multiplied by their mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and then normalized to the corresponding result for the no-antibody control to give the final score. A background level of phagocytosis was determined based on the mean + 3 standard deviations (SD) of non-HIVspecific antibodies. To confirm the robustness of the calculated scores, alternative methods of calculation were also used, including dividing the sample MFI by the no-antibody control MFI without assigning a positivity cutoff, as well as subtracting the sample MFI by the no-antibody control MFI. These alternate methods of calculation gave similar results. Robustness of the assay was confirmed by multiple scientists obtaining similar results with control antibodies and also replicating key phagocytosis experiments. We have obtained a range of phagocytosis scores between 2 to 20, giving a 10-fold assay dynamic range. Where relevant, fold differences in phagocytosis score are calculated by a division of the antibody-dependent internalization components of each phagocytosis score (baseline-subtracted), using the formula (Phagocytosis Score A-1) / (Phagocytosis Score B-1).

Antibodydependent phagocytosis is best known for its essential role in defense against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, but has also been shown to play important roles in clearing viral intracellular infections, including influenza [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , West Nile Virus [32] , adenovirus [33] , SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [34] , and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [35, 36] . Notably, for both SARS-CoV and FMDV, protection is mediated not by neutralization but by antibody-dependent phagocytosis despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies [34] [35] [36] . Further, in FMDV, antibodies mediating antibody-dependent internalization show greater breadth of activity against heterologous strains compared with neutralizing antibodies [36] . In the HIV-1 field, antibody-mediated phagocytosis correlated with reduced risk of infection in NHP vaccine studies and in humans was associated with an IgG3 response that correlated with decreased risk of infection [5, 8, 10] . Since phagocytes are present at the mucosal surfaces that are the sites of transmission for HIV [37] , antibody-dependent phagocytosis may play a role in preventing mucosal HIV-1 transmission. A role for phagocytosis in influencing disease progression has also been demonstrated. Polymorphisms in FcγRIIa, which is one of the major receptors responsible for IgG-mediated ADCP [38, 39] , correlated with HIV-1 progression and susceptibility [40] . In addition, impaired phagocytosis is one of the hallmarks of chronic HIV-1 infection [41] [42] [43] .",21.521407034617376,8.353651701229412

Thereby, given the possible association of the viral infection with congenital abnormalities , the primary target of the vaccine would be pregnant women and women of childbearing age, although men may also be a target, as ZIKV has been detected in semen pointing to a sexual transmission route. In addition, there are also concerns over the possible interaction of preexisting flavivirus immunity with neutralization and/or enhancement, since several flavivirus cocirculate in the ZIKV endemic areas, including DENV for which an antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) effect has been described. Indeed, the relationships between the immune response to ZIKV and previous DENV infection has been recently demonstrated (Dejnirattisai et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016) . However, no such ADE effect has been observed in ZIKV infected animal models challenge with WNV (Vázquez-Calvo et al., 2017a) . Based on an ecological study, a possible protective effect of YZ fever vaccination has been discussed (De Goes Cavalcanti et al., 2016) . Furthermore, as there is no guarantee that experimental promising results will be reflected in the clinical evaluation of vaccine candidates, and based on the previous experience from the Ebola epidemic, where substantial delays occurred before the stakeholders established the necessary agreements, WHO has launched a target product profile (TPP) describing the preferred and minimal product characteristics for a vaccine targeted to the proposed priority populations (Vannice et al., 2016) , which certainly will have to be updated in the coming months once new data are available. In fact, there are tests that take months to be evaluated (stability, neurovirulence, toxicity, etc.), but that should be addressed even under emergency circumstances. Moreover, as noted by Dittmer (2016) , besides the technical and ethical aspects, several questions arise regarding ZIKV vaccine campaign implementation that should be considered: Do we need a sophisticated expensive vaccine? Is it economically worthy to develop a vaccine and large-scale clinical trials? Moreover, although vaccines potentially provide powerful tools for the control of viral pathogens, as mentioned before, the development of possible adverse effects derived from ADE of infection of related flavivirus (i.e., DENV) should also be extensively considered before starting large-scale vaccination campaigns.",39.372438949614676,16.852587178145317

Recombinantmodified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the fulllength MERS-CoV spike protein induced a high-level specific neutralizing antibody response in vaccinated BALB/c mice via intramuscular (i.m.) [69, 70] or subcutaneous (s.c.) routes of injection [70] . Several studies have reported that the i.m., s.c., and intradermal routes (i.d.) used for vaccine administration provide a good level of protection against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. This protection level may be attributed to the downstream stimulation of a favorable immune response [71, 72] . However, this type of vaccine may elicit antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) by the nonneutralizing epitopes encoded by the S glycoprotein [73] . MVA-MERS-CoV-S-specific neutralizing antibody titers were highly detectable after either a single immunization (day 21) or booster immunization (day 40) with a dose of 10 7 or 10 8 plaque forming units (PFUs) [70] . Compared to the antibody levels in previous studies of SARS-CoV [74] , these high antibody levels were efficient in blocking the epitopes of MERS-CoV spike protein. The confirmation of antibody specificity was carried out by testing the serum obtained after the second booster against SARS-CoV; however, the serum showed undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV [69] . Previously, a correlation between the levels of specific neutralizing antibodies to the spike protein and the protectiveness of immunization in animals infected with SARS-CoV was shown [74, 75] . Thus, MVA-MERS-S vaccination can effectively stimulate humoral and cell-mediated responses. Additionally, the vaccine efficiency was similar in a study that conducted clinical testing, especially with respect to the immunogenicity of other recombinant MVA vaccines [76, 77] . MVA-MERS-CoV-S elicited a specific IFN-γ-producing CD8 + T cell response against MERS-CoV infection by both the i.m. and s.c. routes following a prime-and-boost immunization regime. The specific CD8 + T cells from the mouse spleen were stimulated with the MERS-CoV-S291 peptide and showed an upregulation in IFN-γ expression. The booster vaccination increased the level of the MERS-S291-specific CD8 + T cell response by 3-fold [70] . Another study using an adenovirus type 5-(Ad5-) based vaccine expressing MERS-CoV-S proteins demonstrated the ability of this vaccine to induce systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immunity when administered via the i.m. or intragastric (i.g.) route [78] . This study proved that the sera of the vaccinated mice had high levels of antigen-specific IgGs and neutralizing antibodies, but no specific T cell response was detected in the case of the vaccines administered through the i.g. route. However, immunization through the i.m. route generated persistent antigen-specific T cell responses in both the spleen and lungs of the vaccinated animals [78] . Protective neutralizing antibodies and T cellmediated responses were strongly elicited after challenging monkeys immunized with an adenoviral-based SARS vaccine expressing S1, M, and NP proteins with SARS-CoV [79] . Additionally, the elicitation of both humoral and cellmediated responses has been confirmed with an adenoviralbased SARS-CoV vaccine encoding RBD [80] .",19.052054295053924,13.58871155697981

M. turicensis"" infection exhibited faster onset of the infection and became PCR-positive and anemic significantly earlier than the naïve M. haemofelis-exposed control cats. Moreover, the cats previously infected with ""Cand. M. turicensis"" had persistently high M. haemofelis bacterial loads (≥10 7 copies/mL) and higher total, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD25+ T cells than naïve cats within days after M. haemofelis exposure. There are several possible explanations for the finding that ""Cand. M. turicensis""-recovered cats became M. haemofelis PCRpositive significantly earlier than naïve cats. Pre-existing antibodies against hemoplasmas might have impacted the kinetics of M. haemofelis infection in cats that had recovered from ""Cand. M. turicensis"" infection, e.g., through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE can increase the replication and distribution of pathogens, particularly viruses, e.g., feline corona virus [33] . However, ADE has also been suspected in bacterial infection [34] because the specific antibody response against Streptococcus pneumoniae enhances infection. It has been speculated that bacterial enzymes can modify specific IgA1 antibodies so that the binding of bacteria to the target cells is not inhibited but augmented, thereby facilitating the prolonged persistence of the bacteria at the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract [34, 35] . Because crossreactivity of antibodies to feline hemoplasmas, at least to the currently available recombinant M. haemofelis antigen DnaK, has been demonstrated [8, 9] , the occurrence of a similar phenomenon in ""Cand. M. turicensis""-recovered cats with high antibody levels prior to M. haemofelis exposure cannot be excluded. Alternatively, chronically ""Cand. M. turicensis""-infected cats may have become M. haemofelis PCR-positive earlier than naïve cats due to modulation or down-regulation of the immune system. The influence of a hemotropic mycoplasma infection on the host immune system has not yet been completely elucidated. For non-hemotropic mycoplasma infections, a multitude of mechanisms have been described that might modulate or down-regulate the cell-mediated and/or humoral immune response of the infected host [36] .",32.03013166672868,12.502923278117267

Particularly these three residues were found to play a key role in the pH-dependent enhancement of the catalytic activity by both experiments and simulations [44] : the reduced contact between His163 and Glu166 allowed Glu166 to engage in hydrogen bonding with His172 and consequently adopted optimal conformations for substrate-binding at pH 7.6.

In contrast, it was shown that monoclonal, but not polyclonal, antibodies that neutralized the epidemic strain may enhance the infectivity of pseudotyped viruses bearing GD03-S glycoproteins, although the enhanced infection was marginal at best [31] . Our research with antibody directed against Urbani-S indicated that the polyclonal antibody neutralized icGD03-S on Vero cells, although less efficiently than the vaccine strain, which is consistent with the previous report [31] . Moreover, in the young and senescent mouse models, VRP-S-vaccinated animals challenged with homologous or heterologous icGD03-S recombinant viruses did not display vaccinemediated enhancement of virus replication or enhanced pathology. Because VRP-S vaccines induce broad neutralizing antibody responses that likely target multiple epitopes across the S glycoprotein, it is possible that the noted enhancement of infectivity with monoclonal antibodies is nullified. Indeed, recent work showed that antibody specific for the RBD of Tor-2-S, GDO3-S, and SZ3-S glycoproteins did not reproduce enhanced infectivity in pseudotyped viruses bearing SZ3-S and identified conserved epitopes that allowed all three strains to be effectively neutralized, raising hope that a single vaccine could be effective against widely divergent strains of SARS-CoV [76] . Clearly, additional studies are needed with more heterologous strains in alternative animal models before the possibility of vaccine-induced enhancement of infection and pathology can be discounted.",17.8046197624263,10.774322536184378

Indeed, pressure can result in virus inactivation while preserving immunogenic properties [11, 12, 14, 21] . The forces governing viral assembly and disassembly rely on both the microenvironment and the protein-protein interaction network produced by their genetic codes [54] . The contributions from studies on the dynamics of capsid autoassembly in vitro and in silico have provided interesting insights into the behavior of such ensembles. As illustrated by Silva et al.

A key mechanism of action that enables neutrophils to neutralize invading viruses is the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [82] . NETs are strands of DNA and granule proteins secreted by neutrophils that form around viral particles, preventing their spread [84] . Poxvirus infections in mice were mitigated in liver microvasculature via this mechanism [82] . In addition to the physical containment of infections, NETs are coated with antiviral enzymes that enable neutrophils to concentrate lethal antimicrobial proteins such as histones at sites of infection [84] . Neutrophils are also capable of mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent phagocytosis, which involve the release of cytolytic granules or phagocytosis, respectively, after binding antibodies via Fc receptors [85] . These antibody-dependent processes are critical in the clearance and neutralization of certain viruses such as HIV [85] . ADCC responses peak quickly (i.e., within four hours) and are controlled by the FCγR family of receptors and can also utilize the extracellular release of reactive oxygen intermediates [85] . Reactive oxygen intermediates are also involved in other pathological responses, including exocytosis. Exocytosis is a cellular active transport process whereby membrane-bound vesicles transport molecules to the cell surface. Neutrophils emit an array of compounds including myeloperoxidase to control sepsis [86] , antiviral lysozyme with anti-HIV properties [87] , and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl phenylalanine (fMLF)-stimulated superoxide release in the presence of periodontitis pathogens [88] .

Although strong immune responses are elicited against both S glycoprotein and nucleocapsid (N) protein [10, 15, 26, 27] , passive transfer studies have illustrated that only anti-S antibody confers protection from SARS-CoV replication in the mouse model [16, 17, 28] . Vaccine development faces a series of potential concerns including reversion or recombination repair of attenuated vaccine strains, induction of immune-mediated enhancement of pathology, waning immune protection, lack of cross-protection for heterologous strains, and limited vaccine efficacy within senescent populations. Furthermore, immune enhancement has been demonstrated with another coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus [29] , and more recently with a modified vaccinia vector expressing SARS-S that exacerbated hepatitis in ferrets while failing to protect from infection [30] . Notably, some antibodies against the epidemic Urbani strain increased the infectivity of lentiviruses pseudotyped with an animal SARS-S glycoprotein in an in vitro model, raising the specter of vaccine-mediated immune enhancement of disease following heterotypic challenge [31] . Another potential problem is that SARS vaccines might fail to induce antibodies that protect from infection with divergent strains of SARS-CoV. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV contains about 2%-20% amino acid variation between zoonotic and the 2003 epidemic strains [8, 31] , possibly limiting the effectiveness of monotypic SARS-S vaccines.

We tested the tumor cell killing potential of this antibody using a real-time live-dead cell cytotoxicity assay using as targets metastatic melanoma cells recognized by this clone (Figure 7 & Supporting Videos S1 and S2). In these experiments, U-937 human monocytic cells which express Fcc receptors served as effector cells [40] and A-375 melanoma cells were used as target cells to evaluate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor cells mediated by patient-derived IgG antibodies. We tested two monoclonal antibodies, both derived from Patient 6 ( Table 1) : (1) the 6_2G3 antibody, which bound to A-375 cells and not melanocytes and (2) the 6_2D10 antibody, which did not bind to A-375 cells or melanocytes in the cell based ELISA prior to limiting dilution, which served as a non-tumor-reactive control (Figure 7) . After 2 hours in culture, 18% (95% CI = -5 to 41%) of tumor cells given the melanoma-specific antibody were viable, compared to 95% (95% CI = 86 to 104%) of the tumor cells given the nonmelanoma specific antibody (P,0.0001) (Figure 7, A, left) . Relative to tumor cell fluorescence at the start of the assay, mean green/live tumor cell fluorescent intensity was reduced to 64% for the non-tumor specific antibody (6_2D10) compared to 18% for the tumor-specific antibody (6_2G3) (Figure 7, A, right) . These results highlight the potential of a patient derived tumor-specific antibody to kill tumor cells by antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (Figure 7 , B and see Videos S1 and S2). For tumor cells treated with the tumor-specific 6_2G3 antibody, we also observed a significant (P = 0.0002) reduction in the movement of monocytic effector cells in contact with tumor (13 mm, 95% CI = 10 to 17 mm) compared to effector cells not in contact with tumor (26 mm, 95% CI = 21 to 31 mm) (Figure 7, C and D) . Using the 6_2D10 non-specific antibody, no significant (P = 0.3) difference was observed for the movement of effector cells not in contact with tumor cells (20 mm, 95% CI = 15 to 25 mm) compared to those in contact with tumor cells (25 mm, 95% CI = 18 to 31). With this example, we demonstrate that a patient-derived tumor-specific antibody is capable of engaging immune effector cells in antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Taken together, these data suggest that systemic melanoma-specific mature B cell responses may be present in patients with melanoma and may harbor the potential to be activated against cancer cells.

For this, we measured the capacity of one antibody clone to kill tumor cells. Antibody clone 6_2G3 derived from a patient with stage III disease (Patient 6, Table 1 ) was not observed to bind to fibroblasts or melanocytes, but bound to a proportion of melanoma cell lines tested ( Figure 5 ). Antibodies against tumor-associated antigens can attack tumor cells via a number of mechanisms including induction of apoptosis in tumor cells and engaging Fc receptors on immune cells [50, 51, 52, 53] . Antibodies approved for the treatment of cancer have been shown to function through one or more of these mechanisms [54, 55] . While our strategy yields fully human monoclonal antibodies in a matter of a few months, we were limited in the amount of antibody we could produce from the B cells to perform functional studies and evaluate reactivity to patient-derived melanoma tumors. However, we had sufficient quantity to evaluate whether a patient-derived melanoma tumorspecific monoclonal antibody could mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of monocytic effector cells and tumor cells using a real-time live cell imaging assay. We show that the tumor-specific 6_2G3 clone is capable of mediating ADCC in vitro and additionally measured the restricted movement of monocytic effector cells once in contact with tumor-specific antibody-coated tumor cells, providing further evidence of ADCC ( Figure 6 ). These preliminary assessments provide a promising clue that a potentially active mature B cell response against melanoma may be present in patients. An example of this possibility was recently reported by Yuan et al. who demonstrated that administration of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab led to serological enhancement of antibodies to the testis antigen NY human U-937 monocytic cells was compared between samples treated with 6_2G3 or 6_2D10 antibody after 2 hours at 37uC (*** = P,0.001) (left).

After limiting dilution of this melanoma-reactive B cell culture, a monoclonal antibody (6_2G3) was further assessed for specificity to 6 melanoma cell lines, melanocytes and fibroblasts by live cell flow cytometry ( Figure 6 ). Since more antibody was available after monoclonal dilution, 2 additional melanoma cell lines along with dermal fibroblasts were evaluated. In concordance with the cellbased ELISA findings ( Figure 5 , C), the 6_2G3 clone bound to a range of melanoma cell lines, but not to melanocytes ( Figure 6 ). The antibody had no reactivity against primary human dermal fibroblasts. In summary, by evaluating the specificity of antibodies to melanoma cells versus melanocytes and fibroblasts we could identify a melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody clone 6_2G3.

Recognition of the epitope on FRα by the test antibody MOv18 is thought to be dependent on the native folding of the target antigen. Here, we demonstrated that it is possible to use antigen-coupled fluorescent beads of different sizes to identify and isolate single B cells expressing cell surface-expressed antibodies that recognize this conformational epitope. Antigen-antibody recognition could be improved by evaluating beads with different characteristics and diameters, while varying the lengths of the avidin coupling agents did not significantly influence antibody-expressing cell recognition by the beads. The latter observation also suggested that engagement of the antigen to the bead surface via different biotins did not mask epitope recognition by specific antibody either in solution or when the antibody was expressed on the surface of a B cell.",12.550561216220249,9.11293588614538

Two vaccines developed by the NIAID VRC, i.e., replication defective ChAd3 encoding for EBOV GP alone or in combination with SUDV GP, were tested in preclinical studies which demonstrated complete protection in NHPs for both vaccines 5 weeks after single injection, using 10 10 viral particles. However, immune responses waned several months after prime vaccination which could be prevented by boosting with MVA encoding for GPs from EBOV and SUDV (60) . Starting in September 2014, both vaccines were tested in phase I clinical trials (NCT02231866, NCT02240875, and NCT02267109) demonstrating an acceptable safety profile of ChAd3 vectors, the induction of GP specific antibody responses in almost all subjects as well as T cell responses in a subset of study participants (61-63) ( Table 1) . ChAd3 encoding for EBOV GP has been moved on to phase II clinical studies and is licensed by GSK (64) . Published results of a phase I/II clinical trial (NCT02289027) report immunogenicity in almost all vaccine recipients and significantly increased antibody responses in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group at 6 months (65) ( Table 1) .

A primary infection is believed to provide effective, durable and possibly life-long protection against re-infection with the same serotype, but only short-term protection against other serotypes (Rothman, 2004) . Classical epidemiologic studies suggested that immunity to one of the four DENV serotypes can increase disease severity upon subsequent challenge with a different serotype leading, in some cases, to severe dengue, a disease characterized by plasma leakage and hemorrhagic manifestations (Halstead, 1970) . Poorly neutralizing crossreactive antibodies raised in response to a previous serotype are believed to contribute to pathogenesis of severe dengue by promoting virus entry via Fcγ receptors (FcγR) and infection of myeloid cells (Halstead, 2003) , leading to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. The role of antibodies in severe dengue is supported by epidemiological studies showing that infants with waning levels of maternal antibodies (age 6-9 months) are most vulnerable to severe DENV disease (Halstead et al., 2002; Nguyen et al., 2004) , and that serum from these infants enhances DENV infection in vitro (Chau et al., 2008; Kliks et al., 1988) .

Flaviviruses have a complex quaternary structure that can adopt different morphologies with a temperature shift. Furthermore, the viruses undergo a series of complex rearrangements in their surface glycoproteins (GPs)both during virus maturation after virus assembly/budding in the endoplasmic reticulum and after viral entry in acidified endosomes. Flaviviruses consist of 180 premembrane (prM) and 180 envelope (E) proteins that associate to give a total of 60 trimeric spikes on an immature virus. prM acts as a chaperone, sitting over the fusion loop of E and preventing premature triggering. As the virion exits the cell, prM is proteolytically processed, allowing the E protein to rearrange into 90 head-to-tail homodimers. Conversely, during viral entry, following absorption into cells mediated by domain III of the E protein, flaviviruses are endocytosed and traffic to acidified endosomes. E homodimers are triggered by low pH to rearrange into homotrimers, exposing the hydrophobic fusion loop in domain II of the E protein and driving membrane fusion and viral entry. The primary humoral immune response to DENV is dominated by antibodies targeting prM and domain I and II of E. Many of these antibodies are cross-reactive in that they can bind multiple DENV serotypes. However, they do not represent broadly protective responses because they lack neutralization potency, while possessing the ability to promote antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (3, 4) . In contrast, domain III of E (EDIII)-specific antibodies constitutes a minor component of the overall human humoral response but may be potently neutralizing. Recently, Robinson et al. used structure-guided design to optimize an existing EDIII antibody (1). Starting with a potent MAb that targeted a conserved epitope within DENV EDIII, a network map of individual interactions between the paratope and epitope was built. Through experimental mutation of the paratope, in particular, within the complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H1, followed by further structural analysis, the antibody was optimized to maximize affinity. This gave rise to Ab513, a potent pan-serotype MAb that neutralizes all four serotypes with reduced virus-enhancing activity compared to the parental antibody. Importantly, the use of Ab513 is therapeutically effective in animal models of DENV pathogenesis. Such studies have offered an exciting roadmap for careful crafting of paratope/ epitope interactions using structure-guided design not only to maximize affinity but also to broaden specificity. For such studies, it is critical to have high-resolution structures of viral particles and/or envelope proteins in native conformations. It is also helpful to have extensive mapping of the antibody-accessible envelope surfaces with large panels of MAbs.",23.30803128782848,10.624697918160546

Recently, it has been shown that in fatal SARS cases predominantly alveolar pneumocytes are infected, as demonstrated by the detection of the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein [37] . Thus, the stimulation of an efficient local immune response at the portal of entry is highly desirable for a pathogen like the SARS-CoV. In fact, this strategy can lead not only to protection against disease but also against infection (i.e., colonization), thereby contributing to reduce the risk of horizontal transmission. Although the stimulation of S protein-specific antibody responses seems to be essential in order to protect against SARS infection [24, 38, 39] , there is the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement and exacerbation of the disease, which in turn underlines the need for alternative vaccines [40] .

Although the value of the oral live PV vaccines (Sabin vaccines types 1, 2, and 3) is widely recognized, these vaccines do have an inherent risk; even though the likelihood is very low, the attenuated live virus can revert to the neurovirulent phenotype. Indeed, a very small number of cases of vaccineassociated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) have occurred in recipients of oral PV vaccine (Melnick 1984) . Experimental evidence strongly suggests that most of these cases are caused by Sabin vaccines types 2 and 3 (Kew et al 1981; Minor 1982) . In an enquiry made by the World Health Organization, VAPP cases due to type 3 virus were found to be the most common in both vaccine recipients and their contacts. Type 2-induced VAPP occurred more often in contacts than in vaccinees, and Sabin 1 was rarely implicated (Esteves 1988) . Given that a human vaccine must be safe for use in human immunization, we selected the Sabin 1 virus as posing the least risk to its recipients. We cloned the whole genome of Sabin 1 PV by RT-PCR. Sequence comparisons of the resulting clone and the Sabin 1 genome sequence (GenBank accession no. AY184219) revealed only three, singlebase mutations. Two mutations were silent, whereas the third one resulted in a Lys 250 (our sequence)?Arg change in polymerase 3D. A mutation at this third site was also found in another Sabin 1 genome sequence (Genbank accession no. V01150), with a Lys 250 (our sequence)?Glu change in polymerase 3D.

We chose 12 days post the third immunization to challenge our mice because we just had limited access to BSL-3 labs, and we speculated that since the antibody response reached the plateau and T cell response is probably at the peak at this time point as well, they would not diminish so quickly after the third immunization.

In recent years, trivalent formulations have been available containing two A and one B strain; however, given the frequent co-circulation of a second B strain, quadrivalent vaccines have been developed [69] [70] [71] . Immunogenicity of influenza vaccine depends on the type of transplant population studied, immunosuppression, and time from transplant. Lung transplant recipients generally have lower immunogenicity than other organ transplant types. Higher doses of mycophenolate mofetil have been shown to inhibit influenza vaccine immunogenicity. Vaccine immunogenicity is lowest in the first 6 months after SOT. Guidelines generally suggest to immunize patients starting at 3 months posttransplant; however, starting as early as 1 month posttransplant has also been suggested [72] . Early post-transplant vaccination may be immunogenic and should especially be considered in pandemics or outbreak situations. For HSCT recipients, influenza vaccine has poor immunogenicity in the first 4-6 months post-transplant, so many centers will delay vaccination until this time. Various types of inactivated influenza vaccines are available: unadjuvanted vaccines, adjuvanted vaccines, and high-dose vaccines. Seroconversion and seroprotection rates from the non-adjuvanted standard dose vaccine range 15-90% in transplant recipients [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] . Factors influencing the variability include type of transplant, time from transplant, and immunosuppression as well as the presence of GVHD in allogeneic HSCT. One study investigated the use of a novel high-dose intradermal (ID) and showed the use of mycophenolate mofetil was inversely associated with vaccine response in a dose-dependent manner [78] . Contrary to in the general population, age has not traditionally been a factor that has impacted standard influenza vaccine response in transplant recipients, potentially because the impact of immunosuppressive medication supersedes the [73, 79] . An MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine is also available and has shown promise in the population C 65 years of age [80] . MF59 is an oil-in-water emulsion that works by locally attracting inflammatory cells to the site of injection [81] . A randomized trial of MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in kidney transplants showed that this vaccine had similar immunogenicity to unadjuvanted vaccine. In this study, persons aged C 65 years had significantly diminished vaccine immunogenicity; after this group was excluded from the analysis, a subgroup analysis of patients aged 18-65 years showed that the adjuvanted vaccine performed better than standard vaccine [82] . In adult allogeneic HSCT patients, another randomized control trial using MF59, done by Natori et al., also found that adjuvanted vaccine demonstrated similar immunogenicity to non-adjuvanted vaccine [83] . A high-dose vaccine containing four times the antigen of standard dose vaccine is also authorized for persons aged C 65 years. This vaccine has shown improved immunogenicity in a cohort of HSCT transplant recipients as well as pediatric organ transplant recipients [84, 85] . Trials of high-dose vaccine in adult SOT recipients are underway.",16.96133536169091,8.697632214667456

Most of the recombinant proteins or subunit vaccines are poorly immunogenic by themselves compared to whole killed or live-attenuated pathogens. They lack important features commonly present in pathogens like lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or unmethylated CpG-containing-DNA that are able to activate the innate immune system and shape the adaptive immune response. For toxicity reasons, whole killed or attenuated pathogens cannot be used in many cases. Adjuvants are then needed to increase the immunogenicity of the subunit vaccines. The common role of adjuvants is to enhance the immune response to weak antigens, and they also are implicated in the orientation of the response to a defined type: cellular or humoral, Th1-or Th2-biased response. The field of adjuvant research is very active and several new candidates are being developed and tested in animals and humans. In addition, the choice of formulation and vaccine delivery is crucial to induce an appropriate protective immune response (local or systemic). It should also be easy to handle and in the best case be needle-free and non-invasive to avoid pain and requirement for sterile material and trained medical workers (this is especially important for vaccines targeting developing countries).

Live, attenuated organisms such as smallpox and polio vaccines are able to induce killer T-cell (T C ) responses, helper T-cell (T H ) responses, and antibody immunity (Fig. 1) . First-generation vaccines providing maximum protection but associated with a risk that attenuated forms of a pathogen can revert to a dangerous form and may still be able to cause disease, especially in immune compromised vaccine recipients (e.g., AIDS patients). Killed vaccines cannot generate specific killer T-cell responses and will be effective against limited diseases where cellular response is not essential (Alarcon et al. 1999 ). These were the reasons which initiated the research for second-generation vaccines. Second-generation vaccines were the subunit vaccines, consisting of defined protein antigens (such as tetanus or diphtheria toxoid), recombinant protein components (hepatitis B surface antigen), or surface proteins (influenza). These vaccines are able to generate TH and antibody responses, but not killer T-cell responses. This reason again restricted the utility of these vaccines to limited number of diseases. Today is the era of genetic immunization, which is nextgeneration vaccine (third generation), which seems to be highly effective till date. This strategy is based upon improved gene optimization, improved RNA structural design, novel formulations and immune adjuvants, and more effective delivery approaches (Alarcon et al. 1999; Robinson and Pertmer 2000) . At the cellular level, introduction of nanotechnology and the development of nanocarrier-based vaccines provide effective immunization through better targeting and by triggering antibody responses. In order to induce an effective protective immunity, these vaccines require boosting with agents called adjuvants. Adjuvants and delivery vehicles have shown to protect antigens from degradation.

The reasons for this apparent difference are unclear. One potential explanation for this observation might be that the BPIV3-specific accessory P gene products encoded by the rB/HPIV3 vaccine are less able to inhibit human interferon induction and signaling than are the HPIV3-specific P gene products encoded by the rHPIV3-N B vaccine. Greater interferon production and signaling in response to the rB/HPIV3 vaccine might have adjuvant effects resulting in a stronger antibody response, as has been noted in bovines infected with bovine RSV mutants that differed in their ability to control the host interferon response [30] . In any case, the combination of greater restriction in replication with increased antibody response makes the rB/HPIV3 vaccine a more promising candidate than the rHPIV3-N B vaccine. The titer of antibody achieved in HPIV3 seronegative children after a single dose of rB/HPIV3 vaccine was only slightly lower than that measured in seropositive children who had presumably experienced prior infection with wt HPIV3 (Table 2) , and, since more than one dose of this vaccine would likely be administered [31] , it is possible than antibody titers comparable to infection with wt HPIV3 might be achieved following completion of a vaccination series with rB/HPIV3.",14.698121926689478,7.774651803102609

This antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is best demonstrated when the antibody and challenge strain of FIPV are of similar type (Takano et al., 2008) .

ADE is thought to potentiate viral infection through the infection of macrophages. Viral entry into macrophages occurs when antibodies bind the virus and attach to macrophages via the Fc region of the antibody and its interaction with cell surface expressed Fc receptors [46] . Neutralizing antibodies can also be enhancing antibodies if antibody titer is low or is of the IgG class [47, 48] . Because macrophages increase with viral disease, this cell type may provide an abundant reservoir for the virus and thus expansion of the virus in the host. Some similarities between FIP and SARS exist. First, in both cases macrophages can be infected with the virus [9, 49] , and in the case of SARS, the etiology of disease is contributed by infiltrating alveolar macrophages leading to pneumonitis [8] . Second, the treatment with corticosteroids and/or interferon alpha ameliorates SARS disease [50] , suggesting an inflammatory, immune-mediated disease. While there has been no observation of ADE during SARS infection, it is worth noting that one coronavirus, FIPV, is capable of eliciting ADE and in the evaluation of vaccines, we may want to consider this possible outcome. However, the difficulty in testing animal models for ADE bears the caveat that if ADE is not observed; it has not proved that vaccines are safe with regard to ADE in humans. In contrast, if an animal model for ADE is developed, we may learn more about the mechanism of SARS-induced ADE, which may help form the basis for developing guidelines for safe vaccine development.",44.77968953742822,19.56528158925954

A vaccinia virus-based vaccine expressing the FIPV surface (S) glycoprotein was developed, and was shown to induce high levels of anti-FIPV neutralizing antibody. 29 However, this anti-S antibody was not protective against challenge with virulent FIPV. Rather, it induced an antibody-dependent accelerated and enhanced disease after challenge. Of note, antibody-dependent enhancement has never been observed in naturally infected felines, but the possibility that it might develop has been a concern as vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are developed. 30 ",35.74823945553847,18.09473705517363

Severity of FIP is correlated with imbalance of B cells and T cells population, where the cell-mediated immunity can properly shift the disease to the dry form whilst, increase of B cells and antibody response can lead to type III hypersensitivity, antibody-dependent vasculitis and effusive form of the disease [6] . Hence, during FIPV infection, depletion of the lymphoid cells plays an important role in the virus pathogenesis [9] . In addition, infection of macrophages can increase B cells activity and contribute to antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of the symptoms and effusive form of the disease [5] . Since FIPV does not infect lymphocytes, it seems that this virus cause the lymphopenia through apoptosis induction. Studies have reported that apoptosis of mononuclear cells and particularly CD8? T cells in infected cats is associated with the secretion of TNF-alpha from macrophages [10] . On the other hand, decreased of TNF-a along with high amount of IFN-c and IL-1b resulted in the augmentation of these CD8? T-cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the infected cats [11] . Therefore, apoptosis T cell is probably caused by soluble mediators released from infection to macrophages and/or intestinal epithelial cells [10] . Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis during FIPV infection. The current study is investigating mode of cell death of Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells and the transcriptome of the infected cells following infection with FIPV WSU 79-1146.

What are the viral virulence factors and can we use this information to develop an attenuated strain? Can the virus establish persistent infection and can humans be repeatedly infected? We also need to determine the innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in recovered SARS patients in order to understand how viral clearance comes about. To understand viral pathogenesis we must know how the immune system mediates disease. What is the role of lymphocytic infiltrates and do alveolar macrophages enhance disease or control infection? If we define the ability of the virus to replicate in monocytes/macrophages can we be assured that antibody-dependent enhancement will not be a problem for a SARS vaccine? Most importantly, identification of the natural animal host may launch the further development of large and small animal models for correlates of immunity and drug and vaccine screening.

These include host genetics, the human microbiome and other environmental influences [44] [45] [46] . Our study highlights that vaccine efficacy can be positively influenced by past exposure to heterologous viruses, provided that the cross-reactive antibody titre is optimal for LAV enhancement. It suggests that, if possible, ADE could be exploited to deliver LAVs to overcome a key limitation of vaccination. LAVs, as reported previously, trigger extensive innate immune responses soon after vaccination 18, 47 . Although these responses are needed to stimulate adaptive immune responses against the LAV, they may also rapidly clear the vaccine, thereby limiting the window available for the adaptive immune response to be exposed to the antigen. Indeed, our findings that viraemia levels at day 7, but not day 3, post YF vaccination correlated with eventual YF neutralizing antibody titre indicate that the duration of LAV infection influence immunogenicity. Not surprisingly, therefore, even highly potent LAVs such as those for measles and polio require a booster to sustain the long-term immunity that typically arises following natural wild-type viral infection 48, 49 . The improved immunogenicity of the live attenuated YF vaccine in those with enhancing titres of cross-reactive antibodies thus suggests an approach to overcoming short-lived immunity with vaccination. It could also lead to reducing the need for multiple dosing regimes to achieve adequate neutralizing antibody titres sufficient for protective immunity. Determining the vaccine doses that achieve the antibody-antigen stoichiometry optimal for activating FcγR co-ligation to enhance LAV infection and immunogenicity could thus be a pragmatic approach to achieving longer-lasting vaccine efficacy.",18.741600059503146,11.824138899705648

This hypothesis posits that cross-reactive or sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies that develop from prior infection with a heterologous but antigenically related virus enhance viral entry into target cells via Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs). It is thus possible that cross-reactive antibodies augment immunogenicity by enhancing LAV infection of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and triggering host responses intrinsic to activating FcγR signalling 12 . Indeed, demonstrating increased immunogenicity, infection and activation of pathways intrinsic to FcγR activation would also authenticate the ADE hypothesis clinically, which until now has only been demonstrated in experimental systems. label and randomized clinical trial, the effects of sequential vaccination with two flaviviral vaccines: the inactivated Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine and live attenuated yellow fever (YF) vaccine. These licensed flaviviral vaccines were selected because of their safety profiles and are known to generate cross-reactive antibodies that bind flaviviruses, including dengue, West Nile and zika viruses. A total of 84 healthy volunteers that tested negative for anti-dengue immunoglobulins (IgGs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were randomized, upon receipt of written informed consent, to receive JE followed by YF vaccine or YF vaccine alone ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1 ). To achieve a gradient of cross-reactive antibodies before YF vaccination, we further subdivided the subjects into three groups based on the time interval between JE and YF vaccination: one (Group 1), four (Group 2) and nine months (Group 3) between vaccinations. Group 4 subjects served as controls (only YF vaccine was administered; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2 ). Adverse events (AEs) following JE and YF vaccination did not differ among the different groups (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 ). Other than two subjects from Group 3 with suspected dengue and thus excluded from analysis, the levels of JE antibodies were significantly reduced with increasing amount of time post-completion of the two-dose vaccination schedule, generating a gradient of JE antibodies at the point of YF vaccination (Fig. 1c) . Notably, Group 1 subjects had the most differences in JE antibodies when compared with the other groups and provided a broad range of JE antibody titres, covering those observed in Groups 2 and 3. This allowed us to study the effects of cross-reactive JE antibodies on subsequent YF vaccination. Our primary endpoint was the YF neutralizing antibody titres at one month post YF vaccination. Exploratory endpoints included YF vaccine viraemia and the systems biology profile of the host response to vaccination.",26.11841650345604,10.658738672122738

The first vaccine evaluated in a clinical trial in infants was a formalin-inactivated vaccine, which resulted in inadequate neutralizing antibody responses and augmentation of disease after subsequent wild-type infection in vaccine recipients [50] . This experience led to the careful consideration of the potential strategies for RSV prevention and the development of various RSV vaccine candidates which are currently undergoing evaluation, that include live attenuated and chimeric vaccines, subunit vaccines, particle based vaccines, including virus-like particle and nanoparticles, nucleic acid and recombinant vector vaccines. While no vaccine is yet licensed for the prevention of RSV, there are more than 20 vaccines candidates in various phases of preclinical and clinical development, targeting specific populations at risk, including infants and young children, the elderly, and pregnant women who would receive vaccines to protect their newborns against severe RSV disease ( Table 2 and https://www.path.org/ resources/rsv-vaccine-and-mab-snapshot/). Vaccines specifically tailored for each of these populations are necessary to establish an effective multi-prong approach to reduce the burden of RSV, particularly in young children. For example, live attenuated RSV vaccines may be administered directly into the nasal mucosa in young children to induce a robust local and systemic immune response, given that responses to vaccination under 6 months of age may be limited by interference from maternal antibody and overall lower immunogenicity, requiring repeated doses of vaccines before lasting protection can be achieved [55] . A particular challenge is that infants with low RSV antibody concentrations are at greater risk to acquire infection earlier in life, and natural RSV infection does not confer long lasting immunity, therefore reinfections in childhood and through life are common. Furthermore, the highest morbidity and mortality from RSV in both healthy term infants and those with underlying conditions that increase the risk for complications, such as prematurity and cardiopulmonary disease, occur in the first 3-6 months of life, too early for active immunization to be effective. Consequently, passive antibody administration has been the major strategy for RSV prevention in high-risk infants until now. However, passive immunization is limited by the need to restrict this costly intervention to the groups with highest risk, leaving the majority of infants, those born at term, susceptible to RSV infection and its complications.

They also authenticate the ADE of viral infection [32] [33] [34] clinically. Indeed, only a small minority of dengue patients secondarily infected with a cross-reactive serotype of dengue virus develop severe disease 35, 36 . That immunogenicity enhancement was observed within a restricted range of pre-existing JE antibody titres can be explained by the stoichiometry requirement for optimal co-ligation of activating FcγR. Low titres of antibody could be suboptimal for activating FcγR co-ligation 37, 38 , whereas high titres of cross-reactive antibody could aggregate YF vaccine to instead co-ligate the inhibitory FcγRIIB, which reduces the uptake of vaccine by APCs (ref. 39) . With ADE, infection led to prolonged viraemia and FcγR-dependent signalling that could have, at least in part, resulted in upregulation of inflammatory metabolites. This interpretation is consistent with previous reports showing that immune complexes can upregulate these metabolites, resulting in increased phagocytosis 40, 41 and improved immune responses 42, 43 . In addition, genes, pathways and cytokines that are known to regulate T cell activation and differentiation were upregulated, although demonstration of an actual improvement in T cell function will need to be shown in a separate study. These observations could potentially explain why individuals with pre-exposure to flavivirus infection demonstrated improved efficacy of the chimaeric YF-dengue virus vaccine compared with immunologically naive individuals [9] [10] [11] .",21.713896722323664,8.638125093720296

These advances are fueled by new antibody screening and isolation technologies, a better understanding of how to construct and use non-immune and immune antibody repertoires, and growing interest in virology. The emergence of new viral pathogens has also kept the field ablaze, in part because the globalization Box 2 Antibody-dependent enhancement ADE is a mechanism by which virus-specific antibodies enhance viral entry into-and in some cases, replication in-monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells through interaction with Fcγ and/or complement receptors. ADE has been demonstrated in vitro using anti-dengue and anti-WNV antibodies and cells bearing Fcγ receptors, as well as in monkeys infused with anti-dengue antibodies 36, 75, [91] [92] [93] . ADE is the proposed mechanism responsible for Dengue hemorrhagic fever and Dengue shock syndrome, two clinical conditions that are frequently seen in patients infected with a second heterotropic infection or in infants with maternally transferred anti-Dengue antibodies. Infection with Dengue virus or any other flavivirus induces broadly cross-reactive, but weakly neutralizing as well as non-neutralizing antibodies 94, 95 . ADE occurs when the concentration of neutralizing antibody falls below the stoichiometric threshold for neutralization and becomes sub-neutralizing. These preexisting sub-neutralizing (and non-neutralizing) antibodies and the infecting Dengue virus form complexes that bind to Fcγ receptorbearing cells, leading to increased virus uptake and replication 36,37,75 . of world travel has increased the risk for rapid transmission and dissemination of new viral diseases. There is also a growing realization that for some viral pathogens, optimal disease prevention and management may not be achieved through traditional vaccination of the population at risk, but rather through instituting local, regional and international public health-care measures early to prevent and contain the infections, as was successfully demonstrated in the case of SARS 67 . In situations where the frequency of viral infection is low, protection could be provided by passive immunotherapy during the period of high-risk exposure, avoiding the potential side effects of vaccination that can cause untoward morbidity and even rare mortality, as exemplified by yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease 68 . Moreover, for some antiviral vaccines, high titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies are either not elicited, or their titers wane over time. In either case, the nAb titers may not be protective at the time of viral challenge, which may occur years after vaccination. Another possible risk is ADE for vaccines against viruses for which enhanced disease-associated clinical syndromes have been demonstrated and/or postulated to occur when antibody titers fall below their neutralization threshold (Box 2). In other cases, dominant antibody responses may be stronger against the vaccine strain than a secondary viral challenge stain, a phenomenon known as 'original antigenic sin' 69 . In all of the above examples, the use of short-term passive immunotherapy where high titer of nAbs can be readily achieved may provide some tangible advantages over vaccination.",30.728579729641552,15.110707904344576

Greater interferon production and signaling in response to the rB/HPIV3 vaccine might have adjuvant effects resulting in a stronger antibody response, as has been noted in bovines infected with bovine RSV mutants that differed in their ability to control the host interferon response.

The titer of antibody achieved in HPIV3 seronegative children after a single dose of rB/HPIV3 vaccine was only slightly lower than that measured in seropositive children who had presumably experienced prior infection with wt HPIV3 (Table 2) , and, since more than one dose of this vaccine would likely be administered [31] , it is possible than antibody titers comparable to infection with wt HPIV3 might be achieved following completion of a vaccination series with rB/HPIV3. The tolerability of these vaccines was difficult to assess completely in these small phase I clinical trials. Importantly, LRI and/or other SAEs associated with vaccine virus shedding were not observed. Fever and upper respiratory illnesses were frequently detected in both vaccinees and placebo recipients, and a variety of adventitious viral agents were isolated from several subjects. These types of illnesses often occur in infants and preschoolers and can confound the assessment of reactogenicity of a live-attenuated respiratory virus vaccine. In particular, assessing the causal relationship between vaccine administration and a mild illness such as rhinorrhea will require studies in larger numbers of children: for example, the association between the live-attenuated influenza vaccine FluMist and mild upper respiratory symptoms was not apparent until large-scale studies were completed. [32] If the rB/HPIV3 vaccine undergoes further clinical development, additional information regarding the safety and reactogenicity of this vaccine will need to be obtained.",15.791748771041592,7.813359090824411

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism through which dengue viruses, feline coronaviruses, and HIV viruses take advantage of anti-viral humoral immune responses to infect host target cells. Here we describe our observations of SARS-CoV using ADE to enhance the infectivity of a HL-CZ human promonocyte cell line. Quantitative-PCR and immunofluorescence staining results indicate that SARS-CoV is capable of replication in HL-CZ cells, and of displaying virus-induced cytopathic effects and increased levels of TNF-a, IL-4 and IL-6 two days post-infection. According to flow cytometry data, the HL-CZ cells also expressed angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, a SARS-CoV receptor) and higher levels of the FccRII receptor. We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection.

Do neutralizing antibodies bind those viral epitopes that prevent their recognition by the receptors on potentially permissive cells or do they inhibit the fusion of the viral membrane with the endocytic membrane? If it is simple blocking, multiple antibodies appear to be needed since as many as 25 % of such viral epitopes must be antibody bound to prevent infection [45, 47] . Is simple blocking by antibodies enough or is help needed from an immune complex? In the case of EAV, adding fresh serum as a source of complement, greatly increased the effectiveness of VN. Covalent binding of C3 and C4 can facilitate clearance by cells that express complement receptors. In addition to merely facilitating clearance, complement-containing immune complexes can augment B cell activation [46] , whereas IgG complexes without complement can downregulate B cell responses through crosslinking to FccRIIb [47] .

However, the virulence of mar mutant virus of FIPV in cats remains unexamined. Cats inoculated with strain FIPV 79-1146 frequently develop FIP.

Furthermore, strain FIPV 79-1146 is suitable for examining the correlation between the proliferation of FIPV in monocytes/macrophages and its virulence in cats because of the high proliferation of strain FIPV 79-1146 in monocytes/macrophages. Corapi et al. (1995) and Hohdatsu et al. (1993) reported that FIPV 79-1146-neutralizing MAb exhibited potent ADE activity in macrophages. Their report suggested that neutralizing and antibody-dependent enhancing epitopes are present in the same region in FIPV 79-1146, but this hypothesis has not been verified. We revealed that MAbs which lost neutralizing activity against mar mutant viruses also lost ADE activity, showing that neutralizing and antibody-dependent enhancing epitopes are present in the same region of the S protein in FIPV 79-1146, as hypothesized. On the other hand, MAb which neutralized FECV 79-1683 on fcwf-4 cells did not exhibit ADE activity on macrophages. The reason for the absence of ADE activity for FECV 79-1683 is unclear.

An immunological viewpoint,"COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new type of enveloped RNA coronavirus, which can be transmitted by person-to-person via airborne and contact and caused epidemics in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province.

Genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed that there were two major types (designated L and S), which were well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms. The S type was found to be ancestral version, however, the L type (∼70 %) is more aggressive and spreads more quickly than the S type (∼30 %) (Tang et al., 2020) . The amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 share 68 % similarity with those of SARS-CoV, to which the response of viral infection by type I IFN is suppressed and therefore viruses rapidly replicate and induce excessive inflammatory response (Prompetchara et al., 2020) . Moreover, there was significant discrepancy of serious cases and deaths happened between the areas within Hubei Province and the rest of the world, which may be possibly explained by antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes with other coronaviruses. ADE can cause sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and cytokine storm, and one or all of which happened in the reported severe cases and deaths (Tetro, 2020) . Although SARS-CoV-2 has some similarities with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than other viruses among populations, which has caused more than 60,000 people infected worldwide within 2 months (Lu et al., 2020) . More importantly, there is no effective targeted treatment for the virus, and a persistent infection may involve stages of both silent and productive infection of the host cells (Boldogh et al., 1996) . Therefore, COVID-19 infection is a great challenge to the immune system.",23.609591075153933,12.358903741767133

Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a wellestablished effect that requires effector cells and counteracts viral infection by killing the virus-producing cell [27, 28] . The antibodies involved may be neutralizing, when tested in the absence of effector cells (natural killer cells) but often are not. And some neutralizing antibodies are not of the right isotype to mediate this effect. Antibody-dependent cellmediated viral inhibition (ADCVI) has a more complicated relationship to neutralization, which may concomitantly occur in the assay used for measuring the effect. But to the extent that the inhibition depends on effector cells, it is not neutralization. Again, antibody isotype will affect the component in ADCVI that involves Fc-Fc-receptor interactions. Furthermore, the epitope location on the influenza virus haemagglutinin determines whether an antibody is merely neutralizing or also capable of mediating Fc-receptor interactions and thereby ADCC and protection in vivo in a mouse model [51] .",24.81165853542262,10.915062916187054

One effect that might come closest is the binding of NAb-virion complexes to Fc receptors, followed by endocytosis, and ultimately lysosomal degradation of the virus. This antibody-dependent routing of virus would qualify as neutralization according to the definition. With HIV-1, for example, internalization depending on low NAb occupancy and subsequent loss of infectivity were observed, albeit not categorized as neutralization, perhaps because the 8 Advances in Biology effect was too weak compared with regular neutralization [148] . But it should be noted that this mechanism would prevent entry: viable genome-containing cores would not enter the cytoplasm. The routing to lysosomal degradation may be inefficient because it is outcompeted by productive entry, which can occur across the endosomal membrane. Indeed, that may be the regular site of productive entry for HIV-1 [84, 85, 137] . Conceivably, the antibody in complex with the Fc receptor would block the fusogenic Env-receptor interactions by steric hindrance and thus delay fusion until degradation in the lysosomal compartment starts. Still, it might require lower occupancies by antibody molecules on the virions than the regular entry block, just as the much more vigorous TRIM21 mechanism would. Enveloped viruses among themselves also provide contrasting examples: low occupancies on flaviviruses can mediate enhancement of infectivity, whereas high occupancies by the same antibodies cause neutralization [81, [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] .

One strategy to reduce the overall cost is to develop exceptionally potent neutralizing mAbs, resulting in a reduction in the dose required to achieve efficacy. This could be achieved by developing human mAbs with ultra high binding affinity and then rationally designing the products to target the critical neutralization site, e.g., RBD. For example, the exceptionally potent mAb m336 can bind to the MERS-CoV RBD with picomolar affinity, and the potency for virus neutralization (IC 50 ) is also in the picomolar range, suggesting that a low dose of mAbs could be clinically effective. Furthermore, recent progress in antibody engineering enables the generation of more effective antibody-based therapeutics, e.g., bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, or antibodies with improved effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [5] . Notably, antibody fragments with a reduced size (12e50 kDa) could achieve enhanced tissue penetration, as well as a wider range of possible targets, and, importantly, require much lower production costs, providing the potential to overcome the fundamental limitations of full-size mAbs [62] . However, compared to mAbs, antibody fragments, such as VH or Fab, display greatly reduced half-lives, and as such, they have limited clinical potential. We recently generated some novel IgG1 Fc-based antibody fragments, which have small size (14e27 kDa), good stability and solubility, and relatively long in vivo half-life [63e67]. When fused to VH, the resulting novel antibody constructs can still be solubly expressed in Escherichia coli with high yields [64] .

Immunologic changes occur as the specific antigens are presented more efficiently to effector cells. Some of these actions create decreased inflammatory and allergic responses, while other effects generate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Other actions can block receptor interaction with ligands by either binding with ligands or their cognate receptors (i.e., allow activation of NK cells). Interactions may also directly cause initiation of programmed cell death (apoptosis), cessation of growth/replication/proliferation, or lead to changes in metabolism. Moreover, there are also antibodies against infectious agents to prevent cell adhesion for entry, spread, replication, and contagion. Antibodies may also be directed against toxins leading to various methods of inactivation. 201 ",18.61027309857544,9.494197705854553

It has also led to the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) (21) and immunodeficiency-associated VDPV (iVDPVs) (25) . VDPVs of the first type cause outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis in inadequately immunized communities and are indistinguishable from wild polioviruses in their pathogenic properties. iVDPVs emerge in OPV-vaccinated individuals with primary B-cell immunodeficiencies and can establish chronic infection and be excreted into the environment for several years (20, 24) . Besides the immediate danger to the chronic carriers (some of the patients eventually become paralyzed by the continuously evolving poliovirus), the presence of chronic excretors poses a serious challenge to the polio eradication campaign, providing an ample source of virulent polioviruses in the environment, making it impossible to halt immunization against poliomyelitis (12) . Therefore, finding an effective treatment for these patients is an important public health objective. In 2006, the U.S. National Research Council recommended the development of at least two polio antiviral drugs to treat chronically infected individuals and to assist in the management of outbreaks in the posteradication period (10) .",16.003713447368302,7.772953477979357

She provided an overview of basic concepts regarding heterologous and homologous immunity in response to serial infections with different serotypes, and a comprehensive update on current understanding of performance characteristics of the only licensed dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV, ®Dengvaxia, by Sanofi-Pasteur). Dengue is the single most important arboviral infection in terms of disease burden, with more than 3.6 billion people at risk for infection and an estimated 390 million infections annually in over 120 tropical and sub-tropical countries. In the absence of truly effective and sustainable vector control measures, dengue vaccines are considered a key component in prevention programs. Deployment of Dengvaxia has been complicated by significant controversy because vaccine responses are driven by an individuals' serostatus; vaccination of individuals who are seronegative at the time of inoculation will elicit immunity akin to that following a primary infection, and thus generate risk for antibody-dependent enhancement, with higher risk of severe disease upon subsequent dengue infection. In contrast, vaccination of individuals who are seropositive has been shown to have at least 72% efficacy to protect against subsequent symptomatic infection (Sridhar et al. N Engl J Med 2018 Jul 26:379(4):327-340). The WHO initially recommended (April 2016) that the vaccine should be deployed only in areas with seroprevalence > 70%. However, in 2017, more definitive evidence from a retrospective analysis of clinical trial data revealed an excess of severe dengue in seronegative vaccine recipients. The WHO SAGE (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts) working group was therefore obliged to reconsider guidelines for how to best use the vaccine (http://www.who. int/immunization/sage/previous/en/index.html) and to evaluate under which circumstances there may be a net public health benefit versus individual risk. The key consideration was whether WHO should recommend countries to conduct population seroprevalence studies to measure endemicity levels prior to vaccine introductions; or rather to develop individual-based pre-vaccination screening programs. Both approaches present challenges due to cross-reactive dengue seroassays. The talk concluded with a discussion of other dengue vaccines under development, including chimeric vaccines from Takeda and Butantan, for which clinical phase III trials are underway.",24.80950697958227,12.051568967550145

Typical infection results in classic dengue fever (DF), which is self-limiting and has flu-like symptoms in conjunction with retroorbital pain, headache, skin rash, and bone and muscle pain. DHF can follow, with vascular leak syndrome and low platelet count, resulting in hemorrhage. In the most extreme cases, dengue shock syndrome (Dss) develops, characterized by hypotension, shock, and circulatory failure (World Health Organization, 1997) . Thrombocytopenia is a hallmark clinical sign of infection, and aids in differential diagnosis (Gregory et al., 2010) . severe disease has a higher propensity to occur upon secondary infection with a different DeNV serotype (Thein et al., 1997) . This is hypothesized to occur due to antibody dependent enhancement (ADe). There is no approved vaccine or drug, and hospitalized patients receive supportive care including fluid replacement. In order to further progress toward an effective drug or vaccine, small human cohort studies have taken place. However, to provide statistically relevant results, testing must progress in an animal model.

Studies have shown that patient convalescent serum and monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein efficiently neutralize infectious virus. Further studies are essential to evaluate any concerns about potential antibody-mediated enhancement of disease and to determine if neutralization escape mutants arise rapidly after challenge with infectious virus.

SARS-CoV-specific serum and mucosal immunoglobulins were readily detected in immunized animals. Serum IgG blocked binding of the S-protein to the ACE2 receptor and neutralized SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Entry into human B cell lines occurred in a Fc␥RII-dependent and ACE2-independent fashion indicating that ADE of virus entry is a novel cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV. Vaccinated animals showed no signs of enhanced lung pathology or hepatitis and viral load was undetectable or greatly reduced in lungs following challenge with SARS-CoV.

Mab 6D6 may, therefore, have potential as a therapeutic agent in animal models. He also described a novel antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism in which Fc receptor-mediated intracellular signaling increased uptake of Ebola virus into cells in vitro (Furuyama et al., 2016) . Activation of the Fc-receptor-mediated signaling pathway was essential for ADE of Ebola virus infection; this finding provides new insights into mechanisms of ADE and the development of treatments for ADE-associated diseases. Finally, he noted that neutralizing and ADE antibodies show balanced effects depending on total antibody concentration, raising theoretical concerns about the use of convalescent human sera or plasma with low antibody titers.

Different vaccine candidates have been explored for SARS including DNA [19] , Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) [16] subunit vaccine [20] or inactivated virus vaccine [21] [22] [23] and they all have been shown to induce neutralizing and protective responses. While protection was achieved in the mouse with a recombinant MVA virus expressing S protein [16] , vaccination with a different MVA-S construct failed to elicit a sustained serum neutralizing antibody titer to SARS-CoV in ferrets and subsequent challenge with SARS-CoV was associated with hepatitis [24] . In vitro data also demonstrate that anti-S immune responses can enhance SARS-CoV entry into target cells. Yang and colleagues showed that entry of SARS-CoV pseudotype viruses, expressing the palm civet S-protein, into a human renal epithelial cell-line was enhanced by human S-specific neutralizing antibodies [25] . Such in vitro detectable facilitating antibodies can be correlated with disease enhancement in feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cats (FIPV) and it has been shown that vaccine-induced anti-S antibodies and macrophage-expressed Fc receptors (FcR) are key factors of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [26, 27] in cats.",35.80445266511825,17.257318773481998

ADE occurs when a virus-antibody complex interacts with FcR or complement to trigger virus uptake or alternatively when antibodies induce conformational changes in envelope glycoproteins that are required for virus-cell membrane fusion [56] . Antibody-dependent conformational changes have previously been reported for a civet cat strain of SARS-CoV which showed enhanced entry into a human renal epithelial cell-line in the presence of human monoclonal antibodies against human strain of SARS-CoV Spike [25] . We could exclude this mechanism of enhancement as sera from triSpike vaccinated mice did neutralize, rather than enhance, virus infection on VeroE6 cells. However, we observed that sera from triSpike vaccinated mice or hamsters showed a 100-1000 fold increase in virus entry into Fc␥RII positive, ACE2-negative human B cells. ADE was still observed when the complement was inactivated by heat treatment of sera but could be abrogated by protein G and an anti-Fc␥RII antibody, demonstrating that ADE is mediated by the Fc region of the antibody and the Fc␥RII receptor. Interestingly, the R/R131 genotype of the human Fc␥RIIA receptor was recently correlated with severity of disease in SARS patients [57] . Our results show that anti-ACE2 antibody did not reduce transduction by pseudovirusantibody complexes indicating that Spike-mediated virus cell entry and membrane fusion can occur through an ACE2independent mechanism. Together with previously described data, our results suggest that pseudovirus-antibody complexes might be endocytosed via Fc␥RII, followed by protease cleavage of S in the endosome [58, 59] and S2-mediated membrane fusion in a low pH endosomal compartment [9, 60] .",38.54858564414596,17.18208940900669

It is a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It is the enveloped icosahedral, positive-stranded RNA viruses. The approximately 11kb genome is translated as a single polyprotein, which is cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid [C] , premembrane/membrane [prM/M], and envelop [E]), and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) by host and viral protease [1] . They comprise four distinct serotypes, DENV1 through DENV4. This virus is the major cause of morbidity in trop-ical and subtropical regions, and have been estimated that there are 50-100 millions of infected cases annually around the world. However, nowadays, there is neither proven vaccine nor specific anti-viral drug to all serotypes available. Infection with DENV can cause a spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from flu-like illness, dengue fever (DF), to a severe fatal disease known as DHF or DSS. These fatal forms are often attributed to re-infection by heterologous serotypes [2] . Primary infection with any of the four serotypes can produce lifelong immunity to that serotype, but only temporary immunity to the others; moreover, the sequential infections in the presence of heterologous dengue antibodies often lead to a more severe secondary infection of DHF/DSS [3] . These is attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) when non-neutralizing antibodies form a complex with the virus and infect phagocytes via Fc receptors, causing more viral load and enhance infection involving DHF/DSS [3] . http Passive antibody therapies, based on targeted-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb) have been widely studied in several infectious diseases including viral diseases, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), rabies, vaccinia, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and West Nile virus (WNV), which some of them have been approved to use both in prophylaxis or treatment in the US market [4] .

Several groups have demonstrated that strong cytotoxic T cell responses during FIPV infection are associated with positive disease outcomes (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2004; Pedersen, 2014b; Satoh et al., 2011) .

These recom- binant viruses encoding the luciferase reporter gene and expressing the SARS-CoV Spike protein at the virion surface have been shown to faithfully mimic the SARS-CoV entry process [9] [10] [11] . We infected cells with SARS-CoVpp in the presence or absence of heat-inactivated serum from triSpike immunized mice and hamsters as well as sera from ten convalescent SARS patients. Transduction of FcR-negative VeroE6 cells with SARS-CoVpp was reduced in a dosedependent manner when pseudovirus was pre-incubated with S-specific antisera (Fig. 4B & C) . When SARS-CoVpp were pre-incubated with heat-inactivated S-specific mouse or hamster sera a dose-dependent enhancement of ACE2-negative Raji B and Daudi cell transduction was observed (Fig. 4A-C) .

Reasons for this are unclear, but the respective role of activating and inhibiting human Fc␥RII which have identical extracellular but heterologous intracellular domains and signaling capacities might play a role [63] .

While knockdown of DC-SIGN inhibits DV entry into macrophages with mild impairment on cytokine production, blockade of CLEC5A attenuates the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, MIP1-α, IL-8, and IP-10 dramatically, without affecting IFN production. There is evidence (Chen et al. 2008 ) that all four serotypes of dengue virus (DV1-4) bind and activate CLEC5A to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, CLEC5A is also responsible for enhanced inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages incubated with immune complexes containing antibodies to DV E protein and DV pre-membrane protein (an in vitro system to mimic antibody-dependent enhancement of DV infection). This observation demonstrates that DV can activate dual receptor pathways; i.e., endosomal TLR7 and other nucleic acid sensors via viral RNA (VAMP-1), and CLEC5A via glycans and proteins on the viral envelope (VAMP-2). Thus, it should be possible to attenuate virus-induced inflammatory reactions without suppressing IFN-mediated anti-viral immunity. This was confirmed in vivo using an anti-CLEC5A mAb to treat DV-infected mice. Compared to isotype control, anti-CLEC5A mAb inhibited DV-induced plasma leakage, as well as subcutaneous and vital-organ hemorrhaging, thereby reducing mortality by about 50% in STAT1-deficient mice. Thus, blockade of CLEC5A offers a novel strategy for alleviating tissue damage and increasing survival rate in patients suffering from dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome (Chen et al. 2008 ).",16.21329393766381,9.559827164547842

Cell-mediated immunity is important for protection, 6 but if immunity is incomplete, granulomatous or pyogranulomatous disease results. The development of vaccines for FIP has been complicated by the fact that stimulation of antibody production against FCoV can accelerate the disease, should FIP develop after vaccination has been performed. Antibodies may bind to Fc receptors on macrophages and accelerate virus uptake in a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADDE). Currently, an intranasal, temperature-sensitive mutant serotype II FIP virus vaccine is available on the market, but its use has been controversial. The vaccine virus replicates in the lower temperatures found in the respiratory tract. It is licensed for administration from 16 weeks of age, by which time most kittens have already been exposed to FCoV. The vaccine does not appear to cause ADDE, 63 immunity against heterologous strains is controversial. In a study of 138 cats that belonged to 15 different cat breeders, virtually all of which were seropositive, there was no difference in prevalence of FIP in vaccinated versus placebo-treated cats. 63 A slight reduction in the prevalence of FIP occurred when the vaccine was used in cats that had not been exposed to FCoV before vaccination, but protection was not convincing based on the small numbers of cats that developed the disease in each group. 6, 65 Prevention",21.576164820136704,14.020731459478267

According to this model, animals that have pre-existing humoral immunity but do not respond well to viral challenge may succumb to infection more rapidly than animals without preexisting immunity.

Complement contributes to host protection through direct oposnization and/or cytolysis, chemotaxis, immune clearance, and modulation of B and T cell functions (Carroll, 2004) . Complement is required for protection from lethal WNV infection in mice. WNV activates complement in vivo, and mice lacking in the central complement component C3 or complement receptors (CR)1 and 2 showed enhanced lethality after WNV infection (Mehlhop and Diamond, 2006; Mehlhop et al., 2005) . All three complement activation pathways coordinate control against WNV, as mice deficient in molecules of the alternative, classical, or lectin pathway exhibit increased mortality. Interestingly, the activation pathways modulated WNV infection through distinct mechanisms. Alternative pathway deficient mice demonstrated normal B cell function but impaired CD8 + T cell responses, whereas classical and lectin pathway deficient mice had defects both in WNVspecific antibody production and T cell responsiveness (Mehlhop and Diamond, 2006) .

The S protein also plays an important role in antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection [9, 19, 34] . ADE is a phenomenon in which binding to an antibody makes host cell entry easier for the virus. We previously reported that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the S protein mediated ADE of FIPV infection [9] .

As U937 cells do not express fAPN, FIPV alone does not infect U937 cells, but it enters U937 cells via the cell-surface Fc receptor when anti-FCoV S antibodies are present [12, 31] . Furthermore, as no feline monocyte/macrophage cell line has been established, U937 cells are useful as a model to predict ADE activity of FCoV. In this study, FECV exhibited ADE activity in U937 cells, but the activity level was lower than that of FIPV. FIPV exhibited ADE activity in the presence of mAb 6-4-2 at several concentrations, but FECV was only active at a tenfold dilution of mAb 6-4-2, i.e., the monocyte infection efficiency of FIPV was enhanced in the presence of the antibody, but the increase in the efficiency of FECV infection in the presence of the antibody was only slight. We also investigated the difference in the ADE activity of FIPV and FECV in primary feline monocytes. The experiment was performed at an antibody concentration maximizing ADE activity of FECV based on the experimental results with U937 cells. ADE activity in primary feline monocytes was confirmed for both FIPV and FECV, but, similar to the results of the experiment with U937 cells, the ADE activity level of FECV was lower than that of FIPV. Specifically, the mean ADE activity level of FECV was approximately 1/20 of that of FIPV. FIPV-infected primary feline monocytes and macrophages expressing ADE release excess cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, as virus production increases [27, 28 30] . These cytokines cause a reduction in the number of lymphocytes and neutrophil activation, aggravating the FIP pathology. Therefore, high-level ADE activity is related to clinical aggravation to a serious state in FIPV-infected cats. In primary feline monocytes, the ADE activity level of FECV was lower than that of FIPV. FIPV does not require the virus receptor to enter cells to induce ADE [31] , but FECV is assumed to require both Fc and virus receptors; therefore, FECV enters cells through an inefficient mechanism of ADE compared with FIPV. To demonstrate the necessity of fAPN for ADE activity of FECV, we investigated whether anti-fAPN mAb inhibits ADE activity of FECV in primary feline monocytes. Contrary to our assumption, it was confirmed that FECV, like FIPV, does not use fAPN for ADE, suggesting that the difference in replicability in ADE between FIPV and FECV occurs after entering cells. The non-fAPN-mediated cell entry mechanism in ADE of type II FCoV infection is unclear.

Other than by neutralization assay, these viruses serologically cross-react and encode cross-reactive T cell epitopes. The most severe manifestation of dengue disease is dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, and this most commonly presents when individuals immune to one strain (serotype) of dengue virus become infected with another strain. This has long been thought due to cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibody that binds to viruses without inactivating them and instead enhances the infection of cells like macrophages that bear Fc receptors, in a process known as immune enhancement 141 . However, this may be only part of the mechanism, as extensive T cell cross-reactivity occurs between these viruses ( Table  2) 53, 142 . One report shows that a substantial part of the T cell response to the second dengue virus infection consisted of CD8 T cells having higher affinity to the previously encountered dengue virus than to the one causing the current infection 71 . Thus, a combination of enhanced viral load due to antibody-dependent immune enhancement plus cross-reactive low affinity T cell responses may help contribute to the severity of the disease.",18.459135258965887,11.60976995197

The SRIPs of DENV-1 were evaluated as antigens for functional antibody assays [83] . As a result, a significant correlation was shown between antibody titers obtained using SRIPs and those obtained using DENV-1 antigens, indicating that SRIPs can be used as an alternative antigen in functional antibody assays [83] . A VRP-based neutralization assay for CHIKV infection was established using Gluc as readout [20] .

Dengue virus, for example, is endemic in South America, and its seroprevalence is found in more than 90% of the population within CSZ cluster regions. It is known that after initial infection with dengue virus, posterior exposures to other dengue serotypes could result in life-threatening complications due to the phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement. Antibodies do protect against infection with the same serotype but not when infected with any one of the other three serotypes. The antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon describes a process in which antibodies generated during the first infection bind to the new virus but fail to efficiently neutralize it. Instead, the phenomenon facilitates virus entry to target cells. Since ZIKV is structurally close to dengue virus, several studies have examined their crossreactivity. The studies demonstrated, that antibodies generated after initial dengue infection, bind with high levels of affinity to ZIKV, significantly enhancing pathogenesis and ultimately failing to counteract the virus. The mechanism for this viral enhancement is thought to be mediated by immunoglobulin G engagement of Fc gamma receptors (FcγR), in agreement with other antibody-dependent enhancement examples.",46.05075522089355,21.579573378349576

The distinct dynamic and biological features associated with domain-specific antibody response are quite unique and perfectly in line with those reported in DENV infections (42, 43) . It is well documented that people exposed to DENV primary infection demonstrated a transient period of broad protection against heterologous serotype. The long-term protection, however, appeared relatively later but more potent and specific to the infecting homologous serotype (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) . Given what we have identified here, we could hypothesize those transient and broad antibody responses are likely mediated through DI/DII, while those in the long-term protection are likely mediated through broader scope in specificity. Our mAbs isolated from ZIKV-infected individuals and others from DENV-infected individuals strongly support this hypothesis (31) . ZIKV DI/DII-specific mAbs are predominant during early infection, are weakly neutralizing, and are broadly cross-reactive with DI/DII of DENV1 and DENV2. In fact, many of these mAbs can cross-neutralize DENV1 and DENV2 more effectively than ZIKV, suggesting the same epitope may be differentially exposed and more accessible in a DENV than ZIKV context. On the other hand, mAbs isolated from DENV infection with DI/DII specificity also demonstrated strong cross-reactivity and protection against ZIKV (16, 46, 48) . Furthermore, analysis of sera from individuals with acute DENV infection showed a substantial capacity to bind and neutralize ZIKV (43, 45) , mirroring what we found in ZIKV-infected patient responses to DENV. At the current stage, the roles of these early and cross-reactive DI/DII-specific mAbs in vivo are uncertain and could be a double-edged sword. Cross-reactivity could certainly provide cross-protection across ZIKV and DENV as observed in previous studies (30, 43, 48) . If this is the case, future therapeutics and vaccines would need to take such advantage to develop universal strategies against ZIKV, DENV, and perhaps other members in the flavivirus family. But cross-reactivity could also result in cross-enhancement and trigger more severe diseases in humans. Indeed, many of the DI/DII mAbs, including ours, demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in cell culture (Supplemental Figure 6 ) and in the animal models of ZIKV and DENV infection (31, 45, 49, 50) . Whether such enhancement could occur or exacerbate diseases in humans would require future studies, in particular when ZIKV and DENV continue to cocirculate in more geographic regions around the globe. Should such cross-enhancement indeed occur in humans, our current vaccine strategies would have to minimize or completely eliminate the DI/DII and would have to target DIII or related regions instead.",28.905172782239838,14.2853580206475

While their exact epitopes are being actively investigated, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they recognize more complex structures than those isolated earlier in the infection as they cross-competed with mAbs from multiple categories (Supplemental Figure 6 ). Previous studies of ZIKV and DENV infection have identified potent neutralizing mAbs targeting DIII or quaternary epitopes on the E glycoprotein capable of providing protection against ZIKV infection, disease, and maternal-fetal transmission in a mouse model. One of the potent neutralizing mAbs identified here (ZK2B10) also afforded 100% protection in mice from lethal ZIKV infection, while the poorly neutralizing and DI/DII cross-reactive ZK8-4 isolated on day 4 after the onset of symptoms failed to do so. These results highlight the importance of potently neutralizing rather than weakly or nonneutralizing mAbs in providing protection against ZIKV infection. Future vaccine strategies would have to focus on inducing this class of antibodies to provide effective and durable protection. However, as those DI/DII-specific mAbs, this class of mAbs, including ours (Supplemental Figure 7) , also demonstrated ADE at suboptimal levels in vitro (17, 31) . Development of ZIKV vaccine would therefore be likely to encounter similar problems facing DENV vaccine in eliciting suboptimal immune responses that might lead to ADE and severe disease. In light of this recognition, prophylactic and therapeutic intervention with potently neutralizing mAbs may offer an alternative for the prevention and treatment of ZIKV, DENV, and perhaps other members in the flavivirus family. In this regard, the fully human mAbs isolated from convalescent humans by others and us represent promising alternatives, as they are generated during a natural infection and are expected to have minimal antigenicity and autoreactivity in humans. To ensure safety and efficacy, future engineering of mAbs to eliminate the ADE and selection of mAb combination with synergistic effects would certainly be a preferred strategy. Finally, it needs to be noted that our study is by no means perfect. To generalize our observation, we would need to increase the number of study subjects and follow an even longer time period after infection. Also, as the DI/DII and DIII expressed on the surface of yeast are expected to deviate from the conformation of native E glycoprotein on the intact virion, we have to be cautious when interpreting the data. Nevertheless, the comprehensive approach used here has provided additional insights into the complex and dynamic features of antibody response against ZIKV during natural infection. Information obtained will improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection and potential interplay with DENV and other flaviviruses alike. The potent neutralizing mAbs identified here will provide promising candidates for antibody-based intervention and will also assist our rational design of epitope-focused vaccines that will empower the strengths while minimizing the weaknesses of human immune recognition.",14.84414714773246,8.295159427026032

(Zaoutis et al. 2009 ) published the first of these large studies in 2009 looking at the degree of variation across hospitals in the use of early transition to oral antibiotics and whether there is an association between this therapy and treatment failure. The primary outcome of treatment failure was defined as rehospitalization within 6 months due to acute or chronic osteomyelitis, a potential complication of acute osteomyelitis, or a musculoskeletal surgical procedure. Secondary outcomes were rehospitalization within 6 months due to a catheter-related complication, an antibiotic-related adverse drug reaction, or any other reason. The authors obtained data on 1969 children 2 months to 17 years with acute osteomyelitis meeting inclusion criteria from 29 freestanding children's hospitals. Of these, 1021 had a central venous catheter (CVC) for prolonged IV antibiotics while 948 did not and were transitioned to oral antibiotics prior to discharge. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of demographics, site of infection, LOS, surgical intervention, infecting organism, disease severity, or inhospital antibiotic therapy. They found no difference in treatment failure between the groups (5% [54 of 1021] in the IV group, 4% [38 of 948] in the oral group). The authors also demonstrated significant variation across hospitals in the proportion of children who had a CVC for prolonged antibiotics ranging from 10% to 95%. Data from their secondary outcomes showed that children in the prolonged IV therapy group were more likely to have treatment-related complications (e.g. catheter related complications, antibiotic related complications), had a significantly higher readmission rate for antimicrobial complications, and had a significantly higher overall 6-month rehospitalization rate for any reason. The authors concluded that the two methods of treatment are equally effective, that early transition to oral therapy is associated with fewer complications, and that the results of the study should encourage hospitals to develop clinical practice guidelines and protocols for early transition to oral antibiotics and thus reduce practice variation (Zaoutis et al. 2009 ).",14.047072426029004,7.775988643806959

There was a three-fold difference in effectiveness between MB-003 formulations produced in tobacco versus those expressed in CHO cell lines. This suggests that the differences in glycosylation (e.g., the absence of fucose) attached at the constant region portion of the full-length antibody might play a role on the observed therapeutic effect. The absence of core fucose on full-length antibodies increases the binding of mAb to FcγRIII, a well-characterized cell receptor in macrophages (Guilliams et al., 2014) . This results in a significant enhancement in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, as compared with a fucosylated antibody, such as those produced by most CHO cell lines ( Figure 5E ). In conclusion, this observation suggests that full-length antibodies without fucose are better infected-cell markers than fulllength antibodies with fucose, but it does not indicate the relative importance of ADCC activation versus simple virus entry interference. On the other hand, CHO-derived MB-003 formulations still protected nonhuman primates from lethal Ebola challenge when administered at a higher dose, suggesting that ADCC stimulation is not an absolute requirement for protection (Olinger et al., 2012) .",17.292176861275237,6.436533964969863

Enhancement is very sensitive to the target cell and is dependent on the types and expression levels of Fc and/or complement receptors on the target cell surface. A classical example is enhancement of dengue virus infection, which is dependent on the interaction between virion-bound antibody and Fc receptors expressed on the target cell. In typical assays, neutralization is observed at relatively high concentrations, whereas enhancement is observed at lower concentrations. Using neutralizing antibodies against dengue virus, Morens et al. (1987) indeed showed that the mAb concentration maximizing enhancement was predicted by the neutralization titer. Hawkes and Lafferty (1967) noted that the balance between enhancement and neutralization is dependent on the incubation time of virus and antibody. They observed a shift of the dose response curve as time progressed, and enhancement as well as neutralization occurred at increasingly lower concentrations. Presumably, at early time points, attachment of a small number of antibodies leads to enhancement, and as the reaction progresses, more antibodies attach, eventually leading to neutralization of the virion.

Several mechanisms, many of which still are poorly understood, are at the basis of this phenomenon. Vaccine development for lentivirus infections in general, and for HIV/AIDS in particular, has been little successful. Certain experimental lentiviral vaccines even proved to be counterproductive: they rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection rather than protecting them. For vaccine-induced enhanced susceptibility to infection with certain viruses like feline coronavirus, Dengue virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus, it has been shown that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) plays an important role. Other mechanisms may, either in the absence of or in combination with ADE, be involved. Consequently, vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi-, corona-, paramyxo-, and lentivirus vaccines. Also recent failures in the development of a vaccine against HIV may at least in part be attributed to induction of enhanced susceptibility to infection. There may well be a delicate balance between the induction of protective immunity on the one hand and the induction of enhanced susceptibility on the other.

Probably the best-known example of ADE of infection is the in vitro enhancement of Dengue virus (DENV, a member of the Flaviviridae family) entry by virus specific antibodies. The genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, consists of arthropod-borne viruses such as Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and DENV. Four serotypes of DENV have been described, with multiple serotypes co-circulating in endemic areas. Infection with any of the DENV serotypes may result in a spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms, ranging from a mild influenza-like illness, known as dengue fever (DF), to the most severe forms of the disease characterized by coagulopathy and increased vascular permeability: dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). This may progress to hypovolemic shock in certain patients causing dengue shock syndrome (DSS). ADE was first described in in vitro systems for MVEV and WNV in 1964 [4] . ADE was subsequently postulated by Halstead and colleagues based on the observation that DHF and DSS were predominantly seen in children experiencing a second infection with a heterologous DENV serotype [5, 6] . They observed that the incidence of DHF and DSS peaked in two populations of young children [7] . One peak occurred in infants (aged 6-9 months) that were infected with a DENV serotype different from the serotype that had infected their mothers previously. The key observation was that severe disease occurred in infants whose maternal antibodies had declined to low, sub-neutralizing levels. The other peak was observed in young children who had experienced an earlier, usually mild or subclinical, infection and were later infected with a different DENV serotype. These observations led to the conclusion that pre-existing immunity against DENV could predispose individuals for a more serious infection with a heterologous serotype of DENV and did not afford protection against disease. Later, several epidemiological studies provided circumstantial evidence for the role of pre-existing humoral immunity in the pathogenesis of DHF [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In vitro experiments showed that DENV infection could be enhanced using polyclonal antisera raised against heterologous DENV serotypes [5, 6] . Furthermore, it was shown that administration of DENV-specific maternal antibodies enhanced the severity of DENV infection of Rhesus macaques [13] : monkeys infected in presence of anti-DENV antibody developed higher levels of viremia and for a longer period than the control monkeys.",27.333937766651783,13.547566599523192

Situational factors may undermine researchers' ability to establish the extent to which cases owe to primary or secondary vaccine failure in all or certain vaccine recipients, and whether emerging pathogen lineages are escaping vaccine-driven immune pressure. For instance, high compliance with vaccine schedules may limit variation in individuals' vaccination status and exposures, necessitating large samples to detect factors influencing vaccine performance (128) . Because re-emergence most likely reflects the expansion of 1 or several pathogen clades, limited pathogen diversity may hinder the application of conventional approaches to identifying microbial determinants of vaccine escape (129, 130) .

It is thus expected that the S protein in MERS-CoV will also be important for the development of vaccines. Song et al. have shown that vaccination with a recombinant-modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the full-length S protein of MERS-CoV induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated mice [52] . However, Cao and colleagues have reported that although the MVA-based, full-length S protein-dependent SARS vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses in ferrets, it failed to protect the vaccinated animals from SARS-CoV challenge. Even worse, this vaccine was associated with enhanced inflammatory and immunopathological effects, resulting in serious liver damage in the vaccinated ferrets after viral challenge [53] . Therefore, caution should be taken when the full-length S protein of MERS-CoV is used as a vaccine antigen since the non-neutralizing epitopes in S protein may induce antibodymediated disease enhancement (ADE) effects, as those elicited by the S protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV, also a CoV) [54] .",24.3980352848572,11.62747779979615

It was speculated that the immunization increased the target cell population for FIV infection, through a mechanism similar to that described after heterologous vaccination of HIV-1 infected subjects, as described above. The enhancement of FIV infection was associated with increased susceptibility of lymphocytes obtained after vaccination to ex vivo FIV infection and the induction of Env specific T-helper cell responses [102] .

The fact that the Cuban, Caribbean, and African black populations which share a common ancestry are protected against DHF explains at least partly the role of host genetic variability in this disease susceptibility [8] .",45.622716855889784,18.466356785257833

This phenomenon plays a role in the pathology of severe dengue infection and has also been observed in WNV in vitro [ 179 ] . Although the role of ADE in WNV disease in unclear, the development of a therapeutic antibody against WNV should address this potential issue. Another limitation of antibody-based therapeutics is high production cost, which limits mAb scalability. Producing therapeutic proteins, including antibodies in plants, may be a promising solution. Feasibility of this approach has been affi rmed by the successful production of anti-WNV monoclonal antibody Hu-E16 in plants ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) (MAb-pE16) [ 180 , 181 ] .

Due to concerns over antibody dependent enhancement of disease, this vaccine is only recommended for particular age groups in endemic areas who have been pre-screened for antibody responses indicating prior Dengue exposure [22] . A second attenuated tetravalent Dengue vaccine is under development by Takeda and has shown promising results in a phase 2 clinical trial [23] . There are now two licensed inactivated hantavirus vaccines which are available in South Korea (Hantavax), and China (HFRS vaccine) [24] [25] [26] , but these vaccines are not available elsewhere. Inactivated plague vaccines have been manufactured since the 1890s [27] however there are currently no vaccines of this type being marketed. In terms of new vaccines against plague, there are two candidates that have reached phase 2 clinical trials (Table 1) both are subunit vaccines based on recombinant F1 and V plague antigens. Phase 2 trials have also been completed for vaccines against Chikungunya and Rift Valley Fever virus, although the Chikungunya vaccines are likely to reach the market faster since their development is being driven by commercial organisations. The RVFV vaccines were tested by the US Army and therefore may not be immediately available for the general population [28] . It is interesting to note that new RVFV vaccines are being developed for animal vaccination but to date there have been no trials of these vaccines in humans [29] [30] [31] . Vaccines for other pathogens on the UKVN list are less well developed, immunogens for ZIKV, SARS, and CCHF have all reached phase I clinical trials. In the case of ZIKV there is also a good chance that these will be taken forward for more advanced clinical testing. Encouraging preclinical vaccine data exists for CCHFV [32] and in the 1970s the Bulgarian Ministry of Health produced a vaccine based on an inactivated CCHFV but no reliable human efficacy data exists. More recently a Turkish forma-lin inactivated vaccine has been reported to have been tested clinically in humans (Table 1 ). There is a Q fever vaccine that is available in Australia manufactured by Seqirus that is reported to be effective [33, 34] , however the vaccine is not currently licensed in other countries. For Lassa and Nipah no vaccine for use in humans has progressed beyond pre-clinical testing. However, CEPI has recently funded five large vaccine programmes for Lassa which are likely to lead to early clinical trials. One of the key observations emerging from consideration of existing and new vaccines is that differences between countries in the licencing process and the level of prior efficacy data required substantially affects the time new vaccines take to reach the market.",19.614376125274678,12.84078993413697

As the ability of inactivated or recombinant vaccines to induce eosinophilic immunopathology is dramatically exacerbated by formulation with alum adjuvant, a known Th2-polarising adjuvant, this implies that the problem might be vaccines that prime an excessive Th-2-response and/or that fail to prime for a sufficient Th1 response. SARS virus itself mediates broad ranging immune modulatory effects that might be expected to lead to strong Th2 immune bias. S protein binds lung surfactant protein D, a collectin found in the lung that activates macrophages but not dendritic cells (DC). 25 Autopsy lung samples of patients dying after SARS infection revealed down regulation of type 1 interferon and CXCL10, a chemokine involved in T cell recruitment and inhibition of the STAT1 pathway. 26 Conversely, SARS virus enhances production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, inflammatory cytokines that inhibit the ability of DC to prime T cells. 27 GU-rich ssRNAs from SARS virus activate TLR7 and TLR8 in mice and thereby induce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 leading to lethal acute lung injury. 28 Thus SARS virus has the capacity to exacerbate lung inflammation while at the same time inhibiting antiviral interferon responses.",20.315006143266213,11.910871597374467

There are four antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4 and each serotype contains phylogenetically distinct genotypes (Teoh et al., 2013) . The Dengue virus (DENV) infection induces a lifelong protective immunity to the homologous serotype but confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection by the other three serotypes. Therefore, multiple and sequential infections with the four DENV serotypes would be expected for people living in a region where the infection is hyper endemic due to the lack of cross-protective neutralizing antibodies. Seroepidmiological studies have shown that the secondary infection is a major risk factor for Dengue hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) through antibody-dependent enhancement (Halstead et al., 1970; Monath and Heinz, 1996) . Diagnosis of DENV infection on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms is not reliable as more than half of the infected individuals either are asymptomatic or have a mild undifferentiated fever (Burke et al., 1988; Endy et al., 2002) .

Although correlation is not proof of causation, it is highly plausible that antibodies at appropriate sites have a direct role in protection against both infection and systemic dissemination. Antibodies can neutralize infectivity directly by binding to viral surface proteins that are essential for entry of the virus into host cells ( Figs. 1 and 2) . This property underlies the most commonly used serological measure of immunity to influenza virus: hemagglutination inhibition. This detects hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibody by its ability to block the HA receptor-binding site, which prevents the clumping together of red blood cells after exposure to influenza virus in vitro 40 . Functional neutralizing antibodies to respiratory viruses (including influenza virus and RSV) can be measured by plaque-reduction assays, although such methods require standardization [41] [42] [43] . In addition to neutralizing viruses, antibodies can also act through the ligation of Fc receptors to enable triggering of the complement cascade and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 44, 45 (Fig. 2) .

The trial was designed to enroll 1500 individuals with HAdV-5-specific neutralizing antibody titers less than 1:200 at baseline and 1500 individuals with titers greater than 1:200. As expected, the vaccine elicited potent CD8 + T cell responses that were slightly attenuated in individuals with high titers of preexisting neutralizing antibodies to HAdV-5. CD4 + T cell responses to HIV-1 were observed in only about a third of vaccine recipients. 112 The trial was stopped prematurely after an interim analysis by the Safety Monitoring Board showed that the vaccine neither prevented HIV-1 infections nor reduced viral loads in individuals who became infected. 113 A trial conducted in parallel in South Africa, the Phambili trial, 114 was stopped shortly thereafter and in both trials participants were unblinded. In the STEP trial, male vaccine recipients, who were mainly homosexual and engaged in high-risk anal intercourse had increased rates of HIV-1 acquisition (49 of 941 male vaccine recipients) compared with placebo controls (33 of 922 participants). Increased acquisition was linked to high titers of HAdV-5-neutralizing antibodies at baseline as well as the lack of circumcision. 115 There was no link to differences in risk behavior. 115 This trend for increased HIV-1 acquisition, which was transient and waned after about 18 months, 116 was not seen in the Phambili trial, which enrolled mainly heterosexual men and women. Additional studies comparing HIV-1 acquisition rates of participants in other HIV-1 trials based on vaccines other than adenoviral vectors showed that titers of neutralizing antibodies to several adenoviral serotypes did not increase HIV-1 acquisition. 117 By the same token, the army failed to observe increases in HIV-1 infection rates in recruits who received the live attenuated adenovirus vaccines compared with those who did not. 118 High neutralizing antibody titers to adenovirus per se or vaccination with an adenovirus thus do not appear to increase the risk of HIV-1 infection. The mechanisms underlying the increased acquisition of HIV-1 in HAdV-5-seropositive individuals of the STEP trial have been studied extensively but remain unexplained. One possibility that has been explored is that CD4 + T cells induced by adenovirus vectors become highly susceptible to infection with HIV-1. 119 Such T cells also express homing markers for gut mucosa. The increased presence of HIV-1 target cells at the port of viral entry could explain increased HIV-1 acquisition after vaccination with an adenoviral vector; nevertheless, it does not explain why this increased acquisition was seen only in homosexual males with high baseline titers of HAdV-5-specific neutralizing antibodies.",21.434256137279093,9.004840483072993

In current study, on the basis of our examination of the immune response induced by a N DNA vaccine, we have tested the ability of IL-2 to improve the immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV N DNA vaccine. Our results clearly demonstrate that the immunogenicity of the N DNA vaccine was significantly enhanced by co-administration of an IL-2 expressing plasmid. In the studies on the antigen-specific humoral immune response of the co-immunized group, the antibody response induced by co-administration of pcDNA-N plus pcDNA-IL2 was significantly higher than that induced by vaccination with pcDNA-N alone (P \ 0.05). The production of antibody induced by co-administration of the plasmids began 1 week earlier than that induced by pcDNA-N administration alone (Fig. 1) . From this observation, it suggests that the antibody silent period becomes shorter when IL-2 is used as an adjuvant, this could be very helpful in the control of infection soon after SARS-CoV infection.",12.96770099025925,8.551892995115974

A list of icosahedral VLPs from different viruses is briefly described in Table 1 . The 22nm VLP generated from the HBV surface antigen is one of the bestcharacterized particles and has been the basis of a successful HBV vaccine since 1986 [104] . It structurally recapitulates the native subviral particles released in the bloodstream of HBV-infected individuals at up to 100,000-fold higher than infectious complete virions at 1014 particles/mL [104] . It has been speculated that the major role of subviral particles is to sequester-induced neutralizing antibodies against complete virions and acts as an immune evasion technique during viral infection. While the exact mechanism by which the HBsAg lipoprotein self-assembles is yet to be fully elucidated, there is evidence from VLP studies that intra-and intermolecular disulfide bonds are required for proper recapitulation of the antigenic and immunogenic properties of subviral particles [105] . It is interesting to note that the same subviral particle has been used to develop the first generation of HBV vaccine with great success. Spherical-shaped VLPs are also generated from several families of viruses (Table 6 ). VLPs generated from the Gag protein of retroviruses have also been pursued by many research groups. Expression of Gag is sufficient to form retrovirus VLPs, although there are multiple strategies in combining other viral proteins to generate VLPs-with the stipulation that viral replication and/or integration cannot be initiated. This may involve genetically removing viral enzymes such as the reverse transcriptase and integrase. Conversely, a retroviral VLP can be composed of multiple immunological targets that can stimulate both the humoral antibody and cellular responses without the deleterious effects of a live-attenuated vaccine. Indeed, VLPs expressing a native form of HIV-1 envelope protein can elicit strong humoral and cellular responses, which can lead to antibody-dependent cell-mediated immunity [113] .",14.193495063436078,7.23832950389208

ADE is a well-recognized phenomenon observed in various infections including numerous flavivirus infections, e.g. West Nile virus and dengue virus. Both active immunization and passive transfer of antibody have been shown to mediate this phenomenon, resulting from increased uptake of virus in the presence of neutralizing antibody [87, 88] . Virus-specific antibodies enhance viral entry into, and in some cases, replication in monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells through interaction with Fcg and/or complement receptors. ADE is the proposed mechanism responsible for dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, two clinical conditions that are frequently seen in patients infected with a second heterotropic infection and infants with maternally transferred anti-dengue antibodies. For dengue virus, four serotypes exist and the generation of antibodies following exposure to one serotype may affect the response to repeat exposure with the same or an alternative serotype [89, 90] . Experimental passive transfer of a high dose of serotypespecific antibodies enable elimination of viremia, but lower doses of such antibodies or cross-reactive polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies may all cause enhanced disease in vivo [88] [89] [90] .

Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), another member of the coronaviruses, exhibited enhanced FIPV infection into monocytes/macrophages through viral-specific antibody binding to the Fc receptors of these cells, and caused enhanced inflammation [31] . However, there is no evidence that NT antibodies against SARS-CoV cause antibody-dependent enhancement, and correlation between inflammation and antibodydependent enhancement by MVA/S vaccination has not yet been established.

Many vaccine recipients developed severe disease, several of which were lethal following natural infection with RSV (Kapikian et al., 1969) .The explanation for the ineffective and untoward immune response to RSV remains obscure. Thus, infection induces neutralizing antibody production as well as CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses to peptides from most viral proteins.

Given the observation of intermittent outbreaks thus far, the ability to store vaccine stockpiles for long periods of time is also necessary. Such a product profile has yet to be achieved for any vaccine. The WHO has defined a more limited target product profile (Table 1) , at least for a first-generation vaccine product. 47 Vaccine development will also face several challenges, including the lack of an established correlate of protection (in children, adults, and the fetus), current unpredictability and lack of outbreaks, the large number of subclinical infections, the marked variability in clinical manifestations during symptomatic illness, the need to test multiple vulnerable populations, the uncertain effects of prior immunity to ZIKV or other flaviviruses (ie, DENV), and the lack of animal models that recapitulate important features of human disease. 48 These and other factors have been discussed in a recent WHO landscape analysis. 49 Zika Immunology Both type I and type III IFNs are produced in response to ZIKV infection and can limit viral replication. 50 Zika virus proteins can actively inhibit the IFN response during infection. 51 As we learn more details about these virus-host interactions, the results may provide important information regarding appropriate adjuvant selection for vaccine candidates. Many of the animal models used for ZIKV work have defects in innate immune pathways; therefore, results must be interpreted with caution, as they may not reflect what will occur in humans. Nonhuman primate, guinea pig, and chicken embryo models are also being developed, as are models to study vaccine outcomes in pregnancy. 31, [52] [53] [54] [55] Efforts are also under way to develop a controlled human infection model for Zika, much like what has been done with influenza, malaria, and DENV. 56 The adaptive immune response to flaviviruses (including ZIKV) involves both humoral and cell-mediated components. Neutralizing antibody (considered a major contributor to protective immunity) responses target the E protein and are crossreactive with other flaviviruses. [57] [58] [59] This cross-reactivity has been an issue for diagnostic tests in areas where diseases such as dengue fever, West Nile virus, and yellow fever are endemic. In these geographic areas, coinfection with multiple flaviviruses is common and represents a complication in terms of immune response analysis that must be considered during the development and deployment of a ZIKV vaccine. 60 Monoclonal antibody treatment protects mice against infection, 61 and depletion of T cells in previously vaccinated animals does not abrogate protective immunity. 62 These experiments suggest that humoral immunity can protect against disease and that vaccineinduced immunity can be protective. Despite this, there are several questions that remain unanswered: (1) in DENV, suboptimal antibody responses can enhance disease severityda phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and we do not know if ADE could also be an issue for ZIKV vaccines as it has been in the use of DENV vaccines; (2) vaccine responses are likely to be quite different in individuals who have no prior exposure to Zika or other flaviviruses compared with those with preexisting immunity, and these population groups may require fundamentally different vaccine formulations for both safety and optimal protection; and (3) it is likely that optimal humoral responses to ZIKV will require T-cell help, and a solitary focus on antibody titers as the only immunologic end point may be counterproductive.",27.97464303845676,12.742999236147396

The severity emanates from leakage of fluid from the blood vessels by a breach of the vascular endothelium. Circulating in four serotypes, severe disease is mostly associated with secondary infection by a serotype different from the one causing primary infection. Neutralizing antibodies generated during primary infection incompletely neutralize the secondary infection virus and instead promote their uptake by monocytes, by a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement or ADE (Katzelnick et al. 2017; Dejnirattisai et al. 2016 ). Notwithstanding a primary or secondary infection, the pathological symptoms are considered to be the result of an unbridled host immune response (Basu and Chaturvedi 2008; Rothman 2011). (Wu et al. 2000; Jessie et al. 2004; Tolfvenstam et al. 2011 ). Different studies have reported a positive association of DHF/DSS development with extraordinarily augmented levels of different PICs that include macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), IFN-α, TNF-α (Green et al. 1999; Kurane et al. 1993; Huang et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2006) . Although multiple reports have suggested correlation between specific PIC level and plasma leakage, the mechanism is still elusive and limited to association studies (Priyadarshini et al. 2010; Her et al. 2017; Sehrawat et al. 2018; Malavige et al. 2012 ). Interestingly however, multiple similar association studies have suggested a positive association between levels of IL10 (an AIC) and severe/critical symptoms related to dengue infection (Malavige et al. 2013; Tsai et al. 2013; Flores-Mendoza et al. 2017 ). IL10, produced by multiple immune cells, suppresses immune response through upregulation of SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) function and downregulation of IFN activity, the result being decreased T-cell cytotoxicity (Halstead et al. 2010; Katzelnick et al. 2017; Tsai et al. 2013; Azeredo et al. 2001; Brasier et al. 2012 ). The augmentation of IL10 level has been suggested to emanate from monocytes infected by the ADE route with additional influence from high viremia (Tsai et al. 2014) . IL10 is a dominant regulator of the immune system that can prolong pathogen clearance through a subversion of the immune response (Couper et al. 2008 ).",22.977921066516753,11.048544766745906

Recent research on respiratory syncytial virus vaccination using a cotton rat model has shown that when the viral antigen is inert (eg, a subunit fusion protein) the dose is an important factor that determines whether vaccine exacerbation occurs. 13 Our group found that to also be true for the formalin inactivated alum adjuvanted bovine respiratory syncytial virus vaccine. 12 Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is another disease that has been associated with vaccine-induced enhancement. FIP is caused by a coronavirus, which is thought to have mutated from the common feline enteric coronavirus. The pathogenesis of FIP is complex, but the most recent data suggest that macrophages play an important role in harboring and propagating the virus. 14 A vaccine for FIP that was previously on the market induced IgG against the virus, which for many infectious agents would be protective. However, for FIP these antibodies opsonized virions for enhanced phagocytosis by macrophages, thus facilitating spread of the virus within the cat. As with dengue, a tropical disease affecting humans, FIP is also associated with antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. In the presence of nonneutralizing IgG human patients infected with dengue virus can progress to hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. 15 The currently accepted explanation for this pathogenesis involves opsonization of the virus by the nonneutralizing IgG with subsequent immune complex binding to Fc receptors and enhanced cell infection caused by improved phagocytosis. Cats infected with FIP virus type I and passively immunized with FIP antibody against virus type 2 had a significantly lower survival rate than cats that did not receive the passive antibody. 16 The spike protein (S) is the target for neutralizing antibody production. A recombinant vaccinia virus vectored vaccine containing the gene coding for the S protein was tested in kittens subsequently infected with virulent FIP. Vaccinated kittens died earlier than similarly infected control kittens. 17 In another study DNA vaccination was used to attempt to induce a cell-mediated immune response to FIP virus. Codelivery of plasmids containing IL-12 and the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane protein (M) was used in a prime-boost schedule before virulent FIP challenge. The infected kittens that received the vaccine containing the IL-12 gene had a shorter survival time that those receiving the plasmid coding for the two FIP antigens (N and M) without the IL-12, thus suggesting some degree of enhancement. 18 ",23.657988169259564,9.44146495755847

The major complication of dengue infection is that four distinct serotypes of the virus circulate. After the first DENV infection, the host acquires life-long immunity to that particular serotype, but this does not provide cross-protection against other serotypes. Rather, nonneutralizing antibodies enhance infection of cells carrying the Fc receptors used by DENV for host cell entry. This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [38, 39] .

In rhesus macaques, the spike glycoprotein peptides S 471−503 , S 604−625 , and S 1164−1191 elicited antibodies that efficiently prevented infection in non-human primates.

Thus, peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV could be engineered to avoid ADE via elimination of the S 597−603 epitope.

Infections range from asymptomatic to a self-limited febrile illness, dengue fever (DF), to life threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The roles of antibodies and T cells in mediating protection versus pathogenesis remains unclear. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) was identified more than 40 years ago, and is hypothesised to be due to the presence of subneutralizing levels of antibody and the consequent binding of antibody-coated virus to the Fc receptors (FcR) which facilitates virus entry, leading to enhanced infection. In the case of secondary infections and of maternal antibody in newborns, there may be some cross-reactive antibodies, but insufficient to neutralize virus. A model of DHF/DSS-like disease has been developed in AG129 mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) and the IFN-gR (IFNARÀ/À; IFN-gRÀ/À). This mouse model reproduces key pathophysiological features of DHF/DSS, including similar cellular and tissue tropism, lethal vascular leakage, cytokine storm, low platelet count, elevated hematocrit, and hemorrhage (Tang et al., 2015) . In order to test the hypothesis, mice were pretreated with different levels of antibody IP, followed by DENV challenge: 0.5 mg of antibody was too low to have any effect; subneutralizing doses of 2e15 mg led to severe disease and death; while a fully neutralizing dose of 500 mg protected all mice. Virus load was significantly higher at 48 h in the liver of ADE mice compared with non-ADE mice. The importance of the interaction between the Fc in the DENV-Ab complex and Fcg receptor was confirmed using an antibody with a mutant Fc region that cannot bind Fcg receptors, or Fcg receptor-blocking antibody or the Fab fragment of anti-DENV Ab. These interventions could decrease the enhanced virus titer in the livers of ADE mice to non-ADE levels. In another model using a VEE replicon and the DENV E2 protein (virus replicon particles), AG129 immunised mice had a higher survival rate and lower virus titers when challenged with DENV (Zellweger et al., 2013) .

In the absence of an effective vaccine, it was considered a priority to prevent cats becoming infected with FCoV at all. It was considered important to look at ways of minimising virus dose. Existing cat litters need to be checked for their ability to limit FCoV transmission by biocidal action and/or good clumping. The effect of flushing litter trays on FCoV spread needs to be investigated. 2. The ideal vaccine should protect against FIP, give good mucosal immunity to prevent infection and reduce virus shedding. Development of a therapeutic vaccine should also be considered, both to treat cats with FIP and to attempt to stop carrier cats from shedding. For the latter, it is essential to establish where the virus is in carrier cats (the ileum and colon are the most likely areas) so that immune clearance of virus from this area is taken into consideration in vaccine development. 3. The group was concerned about antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) being a laboratory artefact (Vennema et al., 1998) . Studies have shown that 40% or more of cats with FIP shed FCoV from their gut, but that the virus is of the intestinal type and will not cause FIP when given to susceptible kittens (Foley, J.E., and Pedersen, N.C., UC Davis, unpublished information) . In contrast, virus taken from internal lesions readily induces FIP. The FIP causing virus is only present within macrophages in internal lesions, where it has no access to the outside. However, some investigators have seen 'outbreaks' of FIP, which can best be explained by an FIPV carrier. Although there are alternative explanations for such mini-epidemics, it is theoretically possible for cats with lesions in their kidneys or intestinal wall to shed FIPV in urine or feces. 5. More molecular work needs to be undertaken on the exact mutations that cause FCoVs to become FIPVs and how these mutations change the behavior of the virus:",31.32443700994855,13.880157341242155

Since the identification of SARS-CoV in 2003, there have been major advances in understanding SARS-CoV genetics 1, 5, 6 and molecular epidemi-ology 7 and in identification of host receptors 8, 9 and T-cell epitopes. 10, 11 Models in mice, ferrets, and monkeys have been established, each with particular strengths and weaknesses. 12 Vaccine candidates have included DNA, a live attenuated strain, recombinant proteins, inactivated whole virions, and vector vaccines; 13 however, none have been approved through clinical investigation. 14 Safety concerns about a SARS-CoV vaccine have been raised, given the observation in vitro of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection that could, in theory, exacerbate disease. 15 Other observations include evidence of ADE reported here for the first time induced by an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in rhesus macaques ( Figure 1 ) and by antisera from SARS patients (Table S1) , as well as ADE in other coronavirus infections. 16−18 ADE in vitro has been observed for many other viruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza A virus. 19 −21 HIV-induced ADE has been described, 22, 23 but the exact mechanism is still uncertain. 24 Among other examples of ADE, secondary infection with dengue virus of a heterologous serotype has been associated with an immunopathologic vascular leakage and hemorrhagic syndrome, Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/ DSS). 25 Most descriptions of ADE relate to Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) and/or complement components promoting viral uptake and virus replication pathways. 26−28 Goncalvez et al. reported that treatment of juvenile rhesus monkeys with the cross-reactive mAb 1A5, which recognizes the fusion loop in DII of Dengue virus, enhanced DV4 viremia by several logs within 3−6 days of infection. 26 Furthermore, a 9-amino acid (aa) deletion at the Nterminus of the CH 2 domain in the Fc region abrogated enhancement in vitro and in vivo, confirming that ADE occurred through an FcγR pathway for this class of antibodies. Another study analyzed the stoichiometric relationship between antibodymediated neutralization and enhancement of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in cells expressing FcγR. 29 The results showed that there is an antibody occupancy threshold on the virion for neutralization or enhancement of virus infection. Strongly neutralizing DIII-lateral ridge-specific mAbs inhibit at lower occupancy, whereas weakly neutralizing mAbs that bind distinct epitopes require a much higher mAb occupancy for neutralization. When mAb occupancy falls below the threshold for neutralization, ADE can occur. In subsequent studies, the same group showed that the level of antibody occupancy that promotes ADE in vivo is also modulated by the binding of C1q, which restricts ADE in an IgG subclass-specific manner. 30 On the basis of these studies, many neutralizing antibodies may enhance infection in vitro in FcγR + cells when their concentrations fall below a key occupancy threshold, and some Abs that poorly neutralize may strongly enhance over a wide dose−response range. However, for antibody isotypes that bind C1q avidly, much of the enhancing effect may be minimized in vivo.",31.434455639701092,13.112401332759212

Importantly, DENV infection is characterized by a marked antibody-dependent enhancement of replication, whereby higher levels of viral replication and lethality are observed in DENV survivors during a second infection with the same DENV serotype or a primary infection by any of the other three serotypes [70] . Because of this phenomenon, previous vaccination trials against DENV have failed and current interest focuses on antibodies that can inhibit multiple serotypes.",25.074674008218018,10.936406277889656

In some infections, notably those of dengue virus and other togaviruses, the circulating antibodies promote penetration of macrophages and other cells by the virus, evidently via a certain class of Fc-receptors on the cell surfaces. This property has been used to explain the dengue-shock syndrome exhibited in individuals following re-exposure to the same virus (Halstead et al., 1980) . Apparently many other viruses can produce ADE, at least in vitro (Porterfield and Cardosa, 1984) . Tdeost fishes possess globulins and react to virus infections by making antibody. There is some controversy as to the types of globulin in the blood, although for the most part they seem to be of the IgM type rather than IgG (Ellis, 1982) .",28.19200532551618,10.448147343055448

FCoVs have two antigenically distinct serotypes: type I and type II (Balint, Farsang, Szeredi et al., 2014) . Both serotypes occur in two pathotypes: Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). FECV mainly replicates in the lower portion of the intestinal tract, spreads by the faecal-oral route, and presents clinically as mild or inapparent enteritis (Pedersen et al., 1981; Herrewegh et al., 1997; . On the other hand, FIPV efficiently replicates in macrophages/monocytes, leading to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly lethal systemic granulomatous disease of wild and domestic cats (Addie et al., 2009; Pedersen, 2009; Balint, Farsang, Szeredi et al., 2014; Kipar & Meli, 2014) . FIP, as an immune-mediated disease, features the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon (Weiss & Scott, 1981; Vennema et al., 1990; Tirado & Yoon, 2003) . The virus-specific antibodies induced upon infection by FIPV in cats do not protect them, but enhance the infection by FIPV and thus accelerate the disease symptoms (Weiss & Scott, 1981; Vennema et al., 1990; Tirado & Yoon, 2003; Takano et al., 2008) . Hence, there has been little progress in the development of clinical vaccines against FIPV, although a variety of methods have been tried, such as avirulent vaccines, attenuated live FIPV vaccines and recombinant vaccines (Pedersen, 2009) .",25.372843591255744,9.716326574245075

The first mechanism involves immune complexes consisting of antibodies, complement (C t) and FIPV proteins [29, 31, 32] . Activation of C' appears to be the major factor eliciting inflammations and the blood-coagulation cascade [107] . Under experimental conditions, subclinical disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can be elicited and the inflammations are associated with an array of mediators such as interleukin (IL)-I, IL-6, leukotriene B4 or prostaglandin E2. The second mechanism is triggered by antibodies that enhance the infection instead of blocking or neutralising the virus. Such an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) can be emulated by experiments with macrophages in vitro [27] . The detailed mechanism of ADE appears to be quite variable. Basically, the efficiency of infection of monocytes or macrophages is much higher with virus-antibody complexes than with virus alone [66, 67] . This phenomenon involves a receptor-mediated endocytosis employing Fc receptors or C ~ receptors and CD4 receptors. It is not yet clear whether Fc receptor-mediated enhancement of FIP infections occurs in absence or presence of C ~.",40.41975483764949,21.00772978975783

Antibodies are responsible for the protective effects of the overwhelming majority of vaccines. Neutralizing antibodies keep being thought to account for protection and, in most cases, FcR-dependent mechanisms are ignored. Different strategies may be necessary for vaccines against systemic infections and for local infections. Also, as exemplified by anti-SARS coronavirus antibodies, one wants to prevent antibodies from enabling the virus to infect FcR-expressing cells that are not infected in the absence of antibodies (Jaume et al. 2011) . No protective anti-cancer vaccine is available yet, and efforts are being made to induce and/or amplify cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells.

If OPV vaccine is inadvertently given to a household contact, close contact should be avoided for approximately 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination (AII). If this is not feasible, HCT recipients should perform careful hand hygiene after any contact with feces from the vaccinated household member (eg, after changing the diaper of a vaccinated child) and avoid contact with saliva (eg, shared food or utensils) to reduce the risk of transmission of vaccine-associated polio virus. Infants and children who have recently received the OPV vaccine should be excluded from visiting the HCT unit for 4 to 6 weeks after receipt of vaccine to minimize the risk of transmission and vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis among HCT recipients (AII) [734] . Rotavirus vaccine (CIII): 2 rotavirus vaccines are currently available. RV5 is a human-bovine reassortant vaccine available as a 3-dose series for use in infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age to prevent rotavirus gastroenteritis [735] . RV1 is a human strain that is available as a 2-dose series for use in children at 2 and 4 months of age [736] [737] [738] . Shedding has been shown to occur up to 15 days after a dose of RV5 and 30 days after RV1, although there have been no documented cases of transmission of vaccine virus [735, 739] . Thus, routine standard precautions are currently recommended for recently immunized infants. To minimize the risk of potential vaccine virus transmission, HCT recipients should avoid handling diapers if possible. If this is not feasible, HCT recipients should perform careful hand hygiene after any contact with feces from the vaccinated household member (AIII). Until further data on the risks of transmission of vaccine virus become available, HCT units may wish to exclude infants who have recently received rotavirus vaccine from visiting for 2 to 4 weeks after receiving a vaccine dose (CIII). Live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV): studies have demonstrated that 80% of vaccine recipients 8 to 36 months of age shed 1 or more vaccine virus strains for a mean duration of 7.6 days. Thus far, there have not been any documented cases of transmission to an immunocompromised host, and only 1 case of documented transmission has occurred in an immunocompetent host, with an estimated transmission rate of 0.6% to 2.9% in a population of young children enrolled in a childcare center [740] . In adults, shedding mostly occurs within the first 3 days, but can continue for as long as 7 days after vaccination [740, 741] . In HIV-infected individuals who had a CDC class of A1-2 and a plasma HIV RNA count \10,000 and CD4 count .200, none shed LAIV virus longer than 10 days. Furthermore, clinical trial data suggest that when vaccine virus is shed by vaccine recipients, none have reverted to wild type [742, 743] . Because an alternative trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) exists, household members of HCT recipients should receive TIV to avoid potential concerns for transmission of vaccine virus (AI). Health care center personnel and HCT center visitors who receive LAIV instead of TIV should avoid contact with severely immunosuppressed persons for 7 days after vaccination (CIII) [307] . Zoster vaccine: herpes zoster vaccine is currently recommended for adults 60 years of age and older in the United States [744] . There is no evidence to date that transmission of vaccine-associated virus has occurred. However, HCT centers should exclude visitors who develop a varicella-or zoster-like rash after vaccination (AIII). If a household member develops a varicella or zoster-like rash after vaccination, close contact with the HCT recipient should be avoided and affected areas should be covered (AIII). Varicella vaccine (AIII): In 1 small study of 37 healthy children receiving vaccine and their 30 immunocompromised siblings, there was no evidence of vaccine virus transmission [745] . In the postlicensure era, transmission from immunocompetent persons after vaccination has been documented by PCR from only 5 persons resulting in 6 secondary infections, with over 55 million doses estimated to have been given [282] . Because the risk of vaccine virus transmission is low, particularly in the absence of a vaccine-associated rash, household members should receive varicella vaccine to protect HCT recipients from potential exposure to wild-type disease (AIII). Individuals who experience a vaccine-associated rash within 1 month after varicella vaccination should be excluded from visiting the HCT center and should avoid close contact with HCT recipients in the home setting (BIII). Measures such as removal of the vaccinee or transplant recipient from the domicile have not been studied. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine (AIII): Household members should receive age-appropriate MMR vaccination as recommended. However, vaccine recipients who develop a fever and/or rash postvaccination should be excluded from visiting the HCT center while symptomatic and should avoid close contact with HCT recipients in the home setting (BIII).",22.53034028030844,12.871026009481092

FccRIIIA (Albanesi et al. 2012 ), but also FccRI (Bevaart et al. 2006) and FccRIV have been reported to participate to the reaction. The anti-tumor effects of anti-tumor antibodies were markedly enhanced in FccRIIB-deficient mice (Clynes et al. 2000) . Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is thought to account for these in vivo effects (Koene et al. 1997 ) and, as discussed below, it has provided the grounds for passive immunotherapy of cancer. The nature of effector cells is unclear. Cell-depletion experiments suggested a role for monocytes/macrophages (Otten et al. 2008 ) and possibly other myeloid cells, besides NK cells. Anti-tumor antibodies can have an opposite effect and enhance tumor growth. An intravenous injection of antibodies against antigen expressed by tumor cells can indeed prevent the rejection of allogeneic tumor cells injected subcutaneously, leading to the death of mice which, otherwise, clear their tumors within 2 weeks (Voisin 1971) . In spite of extensive investigation, the mechanism of this long known enhancement phenomenon (Kaliss 1958) has remained largely unknown.

The clinical relevance of decreased antibodies to vaccine-preventable diseases among HCT recipients is not immediately apparent because a limited number of cases of vaccine-preventable diseases are reported among HCT recipients. However, vaccine-preventable diseases still pose risks to the population. Additionally, evidence exists that certain vaccine-preventable diseases such as pneumococcal infection, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection, measles, varicella, and influenza can pose increased risk for HCT recipients [193, 309, [793] [794] [795] [796] [797] [798] .

A primary infection with one serotype of DENV is believed to confer lifelong immunity to the same serotype. On a secondary, heterologous DENV infection, antibodies predominantly directed against the initial DENV serotype are produced rapidly. 8, 9 Although most of the produced antibodies bind to the heterologous virus serotype, they are more likely to have nonneutralizing properties against the new serotype, and these have been found to enhance infection, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement. 9e11 In addition, the dominant serotype during recent large DENV outbreaks is swapping. Therefore, accurate clinical diagnosis is important in providing health care personnel the information required for proper case management and planning preventive measures.

An inactivated RSV vaccine, developed in the 1960s, caused enhanced disease after natural infection. Researchers reproduced this immunopathological phenomenon in macaques and showed that it was caused by antibody-dependent enhancement of RSV replication (Ponnuraj et al. 2003) .

Anti-prM antibodies are a particularly interesting group of antibodies with respect to ADE. Anti-prM antibodies show poor neutralization and typically, even at high concentrations, neutralization plateaus at 30%À50%. The reason for this is likely to do with virus maturation; fully mature virus particles do not contain prM and are thus not neutralized, whereas many partially mature virus particles contain enough prM to bind antibody and drive ADE but do not have enough prM epitopes to allow sufficient antibody density for neutralization. Furthermore, virions with high levels of prM are not infectious but can be driven to infect cells by ADE with anti-prM antibodies Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010) . This results in endocytosis and sufficient prM processing to allow membrane fusion.",21.294647592055657,12.916279316158843

In cases of severe dengue infection, where DENV replication can be enhanced by an antibody-dependent enhancement mechanism [110] , these drugs are anticipated to be effective in limiting viral replication, thus reducing the viral load, which may lessen the severity of the disease. The aforementioned drugs are designed to inhibit human glycosylation enzymes, but whether the same drugs can elicit similar effects on the glycosylation enzymes of DENV vectors must be explored further. To date, no studies have specifically explored the DENV protein glycosylation processes in mosquitoes. However, Mason [111] demonstrated the ability of mosquito cell lines to release the mature and glycosylated E glycoprotein and NS1 of Japanese encephalitis virus, another member of the family Flaviviridae, Therefore, it is predicted that DENV also undergoes glycosylation in the mosquito, and glycosylation inhibitors are anticipated to be effective to some degree.",24.700394311347246,12.847214229483926

The effectiveness of the vaccine depends upon the similarity between the viruses in the vaccine and the viruses in circulation as well as upon individual variation among vaccine recipients. The development of influenza vaccines is therefore an ongoing process, as is the search for improved efficacy and broad-spectrum protection. Over the past few years, the application of high-throughput and computational approaches to vaccine development, variously termed systems vaccinology [88] or vaccinomics [89] , has increasingly come to the forefront with the goal of rational vaccine development and the identification of useful predictors of vaccine efficacy. Genomic approaches were first applied to influenza vaccine research in a nonhuman primate study aimed at evaluating the protective efficacy of a live influenza virus vaccine produced by truncating the NS1 gene of the human H1N1 isolate A/ Texas/36/91 [90] . The live vaccine was highly immunogenic and transcriptional profiling of bronchial cells revealed the strong induction of IFN-regulated genes. After challenge, animals receiving the live vaccine had reduced viral replication and lung pathology and less activation of cytokine, chemokine, and IFN-regulated genes compared with that observed in animals vaccinated with a formalin-killed wild-type virus.

Characterization of immune correlates of protective immunity for any of the FIV vaccine approaches examined so far has been elusive, a situation that is common to all lentivirus vaccines including those for SIV and SHIV, and must be addressed for successful HIV-1 vaccine design in the future. 566 Vaccine-induced enhancement of pathogenic virus challenge has been consistently observed with FIV and EIAV vaccine approaches, 567 involving either WKV, FC, or protein subunits/peptides and for FIV, was thought to result from enhancing antibodies that might be specific to epitopes within Env hypervariable regions V3-V5 or to the PID epitope. 462, 568, 569 However, vaccines using recombinant Env proteins with regions V3-V5 deleted were shown to remain capable of inducing enhancement of challenge infection. 569 Occurrence of FIV DNA vaccine-induced enhancement of challenge virus infection despite negligible antibody responses, also suggested mechanisms other than enhancing antibodies, such as lymphoid activation. 554,555 A very recent report described enhancement of challenge virus infection after vaccination of rhesus macaques with an attenuated recombinant varicella-zoster virus vaccine expressing SIV Env. 570 Vaccine-associated enhancement in this study correlated with appearance of robust anamnestic virus-specific CD4 proliferative responses in the absence of strong CD8 responses and again suggested that immune activation may play a role in vaccine-induced enhancement along with cellular responses skewed against CD8 T-cells. These findings suggest major concerns for clinical testing of HIV-1 vaccines for which less than optimal CD8 responses are already predicted and validate use of the FIV animal model for characterization of this potentially devastating complication of HIV vaccine use. A third issue of importance for both future and the current commercial FIV vaccine design as well as future commercial HIV-1 vaccines, concerns interference of vaccineinduced antibodies with FIV diagnostics. All lentivirus diagnostic assay systems utilize seropositivity as a marker for virus infection. PBMC virus isolation and plasma viral RNA detection systems using PCR, although specific, are not sufficiently sensitive to detect all virus infections or currently feasible as routine diagnostic assays. Future HIV-1 vaccine design will even-tually need to address this issue for which the FIV animal model may prove most useful.",19.28089824699132,10.853537398417483

Although this antibody shares the same target as the mouse-human chimeric MAb rituximab, which is currently approved for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (Coiffier et al. 1998 , it recognizes a distinct epitope and may, as a result, have a different mechanism of action (Teeling et al. 2006 ). Rituximab appears to recognize only one of the two extracellular loops of CD20, while the ofatumumab epitope comprises residues from both loops and the antibody is a more potent mediator of complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro than rituximab. This difference in potency is more pronounced at lower antigen density, and may translate into greater activity in low CD20 expressing lymphomas such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where the drug is currently being tested in phase 3 clinical trials. Because of the potential difference in mechanism of action and activity between ofatumumab and rituximab, a comparison of their relative safety and efficacy profiles may not be as useful for evaluating the potential of human vs. chimeric antibodies; however, the process for selecting ofatumumab as the lead clinical candidate (Teeling et al. 2004 , Teeling et al. 2006 ) does highlight an important advantage of the transgenic mouse platform over other antibody drug discovery platforms. Unlike antibody engineering technologies for making low immunogenicity MAbs, where an early lead candidate is then modified or optimized in vitro to reduce immunogenicity, with the transgenic mouse platforms, the process of lead optimization is bypassed, making it possible to test each potential lead candidate in a series of increasingly sophisticated in vitro and in vivo assays in essentially the same molecular form as it will eventually be used in humans.

These viruses have a single-stranded RNA genome that is converted into DNA, a paradigm shift in the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA. The 36,000,000 human deaths caused by HIV-1 (Table 3.3) is accompanied by a spectrum of clinical signs; eg. fever, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, cytomegalovirus retinitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, Mycobacterium avium infection, recurrent pneumonia, and wasting syndrome. HIV-1 genome diversity includes base substitution, insertion, deletion, recombination, and gain or loss of glycosylation sites which all arises from the limited fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase. These mutations are found in clusters or hypervariable regions indicating the fit virus is selected for from vast numbers of less-fit genome sequences. HIV-1 emphasizes key observations: (1) EID is a significant contemporary concern, (2) we are not prepared for the novel characteristics introduced by EID, (3) clinical signs can be diverse and often mimic symptoms of other diseases, and (4) the replication mechanisms are often error prone resulting in an array of fit viruses. Dengue is a flavivirus with a positive sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome carried by mosquitos to man. Dengue has been a tropical disease for hundreds of years, typically a disease of young children but in 1953 an emerging severity was recognized in Manila (Table 3 .3), hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). More than 2 billion people are at risk of dengue infection but only a small fraction of those infected will develop DHF or DHS. Infected people develop antibodies that can lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in subsequent infections and more severe DHF or DSS outcomes. It appears ADE events occur in people that produce immunoglobins (IgGs) with enhanced affinity to the activating Fc receptor due to the IgG1 subclass and lack of a fucose glycan modification of the IgG (Wang et al. 2017) Aedes aegypti is the primary vector transmitting dengue but a new vector, Aedes albopictus, now carries dengue to the southern United States. Emergence of dengue in the southern United States is likely due to used tires imported from Japan which provided a place for the Asian tiger mosquito to live.

It may be appropriate to remember that the usual time-to-market for a new drug or vaccine is 9-14 years, starting from the early feasibility research phase and including preclinical (process and immunological profile) development, clinical development and registration, as well as manufacturing plant planning and set-up [3] . Therefore, even if due to a very special emergency situation the timelines for preclinical and clinical development may be shortened, the question remains whether there will be any need for these products at the time they are ready for the market. More specifically, in spite of the fortunate capability to propagate the SARS-CoV on a well-accepted cell substrate (VERO), the development of a vaccine against the pathogen is severely impeded by the current fragmentary information on viral pathogenicity and the lack of adequate animal models of persistent infection and correlates of protection in humans. The origin of SARS-CoV is still unclear but animals in close contact to humans are a likely source. In that sense, SARS-CoV is possibly not really a novel virus but rather a newly discovered one following its adaptation to a new host species, namely humans. Despite the potential of coronaviruses to mutate rapidly and to cross species barriers the known strains are generally species-specific and genetically stable. Aside from humans, coronaviruses have been found in other mammals (pig, cat, dog, cattle, mouse) and birds (chicken), causing a wide variety of diseases (respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatitis, immunopathology) depending on the species [4] . The pathogenic potential of coronaviruses varies from moderate to deadly and mutations occurring during the course of infection can dramatically alter the virulence, as documented for feline coronavirus (FeCV). Several veterinary vaccines against animal coronaviruses are on the market and the experience with these products provides useful information for the design of a SARS-CoV vaccine. For instance, a number of vaccines against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are widely used in chicken farming. In cattle, bovine coronavirus (BCV) vaccines are administered to pregnant cows in order to protect new-born calves from severe diarrhea, presumably via maternal antibodies [5] . Cats are vaccinated via the mucosal route with a live-attenuated FeCV. On the other hand, pre-existing antibodies against FeCV in cats are not necessarily protective and can even aggravate the disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of the infection [6] .",26.732518104393563,12.309912625638393

This review describes how antibodies operate in the early stages of infection to direct viruses to target cells (dengue virus) or modify antigen presentation to form nonneutralizing antibodies (RSV). Critical to differences in antibody-mediated outcomes are the different principal host cells supporting infection in these two diseases. Mononuclear phagocytes are target cells for diseases initiated by ADE, while in RSV and measles virus it is likely that parenchymal lung epithelial cells support infection with limited involvement of mononuclear phagocytes. These two rather different examples of antibody-dependent viral immunopathology are unified by their interaction with the innate immune system. In both, innate immune responses of viral target or antigen-presenting cells have been modified so as to impede the potential beneficial responses that accompany and follow human infection or vaccination. The focus of this review should not be interpreted to undermine the importance of T cells in contributing to protection or pathological responses to infection during the course of elimination of virus-infected cells.",20.704105394134736,10.623911958900527

The effect(s) of prior DENV exposure on the neutralization capacity of anti-ZIKV antibodies in humans is still unclear [59, 60] . An investigation of late (>6 months post infection) convalescent sera from patients infected with DENVs found that ZIKV cross-reactive antibodies were not durable, and that prior DENV exposure did not affect development of antibody responses to ZIKV infection [61] . One concern for flavivirus crossreactive antibodies is whether they may enhance infection as observed clinically with DENVs. This phenomenon, termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, is hypothesized to occur when antibody responses to the primary infecting strain fail to neutralize infection by a second strain, but through binding them, mark these viruses for opsonization by Fc-g receptor-expressing cells which subsequently get infected. It is important to note that no such ADE activity has been observed with ZIKV in the field to date. In mouse certain highly engineered mouse models the ability to drive ADE or protection and will required more investigation. Studies examining mAbs or early convalescent sera from DENV or WNV infected patients which cross-reacts with ZIKV, found that some of these can neutralize ZIKV infection in vitro and are protective in a ZIKV-challenge mice model [58, 62] . However, other studies have found that some similar or identical non-neutralizing antibodies as well as low levels of neutralizing antibodies mediate ZIKV ADE in vitro. Importantly, at least two studies in rhesus macaques found that prior DENV infection had no effect on anti-ZIKV immunity and did not enhance ZIKV disease [36, 63, 64] . Most importantly, study of acute ZIKV infection in humans previously infected with DENV found no clinical evidence of ADE, but further study is warranted [65] .

Antibodies bound to soluble viral antigens fix complement and opsonize neutrophils, again leading to indiscriminate cell and tissue destruction. Viral antigens may be on the surface of cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, resulting in immune-mediated anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. 66 When viral antigen is in excess relative to antibody, circulating immune complexes are formed that can be deposited in the capillary beds of tissues such as joints and renal glomeruli. In chronic equine infectious anemia virus, with persistent viral replication and antigenemia in the presence of antiviral antibodies, these mechanisms are primarily responsible for the characteristic lesions of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and glomerulonephritis. 66,67 Nonneutralizing antiviral antibodies actually may serve to increase the number of infected cells and the severity of disease through the mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement. This enhancement occurs when antibodies bind to the virus and facilitate attachment and entry into Fc receptorbearing cells such as macrophages by serving as a form of alternative receptor. 68 Antibody-dependent enhancement has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including feline infectious peritonitis, 69 human respiratory syncytial virus, 70 and dengue hemorrhagic fever. 71 Soluble inflammatory mediators released by infected cells and inflammatory cells in response to viral infections are also significant contributors to clinical signs and disease manifestation. These mediators include a wide array of cytokines, interleukins, and other proinflammatory molecules with potent systemic and local effects. The most evident of these is the febrile response caused by interleukin-1 released by macrophages in response to virally infected cells. Increased levels of other soluble factors, including interferons, interleukins, transforming growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor are also present in many viral infections. 72, 73 These cytokines are primarily proinflammatory and immunoregulatory and are generally important for the control of viral infections but also can be responsible for many of the nonspecific clinical signs of viral infection such as depression, malaise, and in chronic infections, cachexia. Soluble mediators also may have important local effects. Vasoactive factors such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes cause edema and swelling. In equine infectious anemia virus, tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor β, and interferon-α have been shown to suppress hematopoiesis and contribute to the development of anemia and thrombocytopenia. 74",24.454953529964772,12.867622195170135

By contrast, when the American genotype DEN-2 infected a DEN-1-immune population in Iquitos, Peru, only mild disease resulted 3, 4 . Differences in the outcome of secondary infection seem to be due to the high level of cross-neutralization between DEN-1 antibodies and the DEN-2 virus 5 . It is hypothesized that Asian dengue strains that successfully circulate in highly dengue-immune populations have lost cross-reactive epitopes, as a mechanism of immune escape. Important for the development of DHF/DSS is enhanced viral replication during the early stage of infection 6 , which is apparently mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies that are residual from an earlier dengue infection and is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) 7 . So, early infection, the time interval between first and second infection 8 , virus strain and host genetic factors are involved in severity of the disease outcome. Plasma leakage, the main patho-physiological feature of DHF, seems to be particularly correlated with blood concentrations of cytokines (such as IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) and infected cell lysis, owing to dengue-specific T lymphocytes 9 .

It is thus expected that the S protein in MERS-CoV will also be important for the development of vaccines. Song et al. showed that vaccination with a recombinantmodified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the full-length S protein of MERS-CoV induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated mice [52] . However, Cao and colleagues have reported that although the MVAbased, full-length S protein-dependent SARS vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses in ferrets, it failed to protect the vaccinated animals from SARS-CoV challenge. Even worse, this vaccine was associated with enhanced inflammatory and immunopathological effects, resulting in serious liver damage in the vaccinated ferrets after viral challenge [53] . Therefore, caution should be taken when the full-length S protein of MERS-CoV is used as a vaccine antigen since the non-neutralizing epitopes in S protein may induce antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) effects, as those elicited by the S protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV, also a CoV) [54] .",26.79838076726915,12.650670022007947

The occurrence of ADE in vitro and in vivo has been reported (Gu et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 1996 Yoon et al., , 1997 . These reports contributed to the establishment of the notion that anti-PRRSV antibodies, particularly the early antibodies that do not neutralize virus and precede the neutralizing response both in time of appearance and robustness, could enhance disease caused by PRRSV and be deleterious for the host. While it appears possible to demonstrate the occurrence of ADE on cultures of swine macrophages with PRRSV in vitro, the real role of ADE in vivo, if any exists, remains unclear and most likely holds little significance for the overall pathogenesis of PRRS. The actual occurrence of ADE in PRRSV-infected macrophages is, at best, controversial, with different laboratories reporting different success at detecting ADE (Delputte et al., 2004; Yoon et al., 1996) . Such contrast between experimental results of different labs has been ascribed to ""virus strain or swine macrophage differences"" (Delputte et al., 2004) , a contention which per se limits significantly the putative overall pathogenic importance of ADE. Regarding in vivo proof for the occurrence of ADE, only two experiments can be cited. In one case it was reported that passive transfer of subneutralizing titers of PRRSV followed by PRRSV challenge resulted in enhanced viremia 1-2 logs over the groups receiving only virus, without inducing any other clinical exacerbation (Yoon et al., 1996) . Another report described that passive transfer of salt-concentrated, non-neutralizing IgGs (IgGs collected at 21 days PI) followed by PRRSV challenge led to increased rectal temperatures and caused increased interstitial pneumonia (Lopez et al., 2007) . However, the authors could not rule out the possibility that the increased pathology observed was caused by the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines co-salted out with the IgG fractions collected from the 21 days PI donors sera rather than by the non-neutralizing IgGs. It is known that significant amounts of pro-inflammatory mediators are likely contained in the serum of the PRRSV-infected animals during the first weeks post infection (Van Reeth et al., 1999; van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000) . In summary it would appear that the degree of pathogenicity that ADE contributes after PRRSV infection could not be distinguished from the overall pathology caused by the introduction of serum cytokines from PRRSV infected pigs, which would have co-precipitated with the IgG. Overall, the contribution of ADE to PRRS pathogenesis is unlikely and has been critically discussed at in a recent review (Murtaugh and Genzow, 2011) .",31.303255132661924,12.327246064086092

The latter phenomenon probably accounts for the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (Kurane and Ennis, 1994) and coronavirus-induced infectious peritonitis, a common viral disease in the domestic cat (Trautwein, 1992) . In DHF, which only occurs in persons with existing antibody at the time of infection, the syndrome is assumed to be a sequel to the facilitated infection of F, receptor-bearing cells such as macrophages which take up virus-antibody complexes. The infected cells respond by producing a n abundance of proinflammatory cytokines and stimulate CD4' and CD8' T cells to do the same (Kurane and Ennis, 1994) . The resultant ""cytokine storm"" and other chemical mediators released are assumed to trigger the plasma leakage and hemorrhage in DHF.

Chick embryo fibroblast monolayers exposed to virus mixed with high dilutions of chicken antisera had more plaques than did those exposed to virus alone. 1 In follow-up studies, 2 this finding seemed to result from antibody stabilisation of infectivity by the Murray Valley encephalitis virus. A different explanation emerged when sequential infections with dengue viruses resulted in dengue haemorrhagic fever. 3 When monocytes and macrophages were identified as the main hosts of dengue infection, ADE was implicated. 4, 5 Infection with the Murray Valley encephalitis virus was increased by ADE in the 2% of functional chicken macrophages identified in chick embryo fibroblasts. Because of the conformational requirement that Fc receptors and Fcγ termini must be of the same phylogenetic class, ADE in chick embryo fibroblasts was reported only when Murray Valley encephalitis virus antibodies were raised in chickens, not in mammals. 6, 7 ",21.28543102969767,11.353306061829272

Flaviviruses have a complex quaternary structure that can adopt different morphologies with a temperature shift. Furthermore, the viruses undergo a series of complex rearrangements in their surface glycoproteins (GPs)both during virus maturation after virus assembly/budding in the endoplasmic reticulum and after viral entry in acidified endosomes. Flaviviruses consist of 180 premembrane (prM) and 180 envelope (E) proteins that associate to give a total of 60 trimeric spikes on an immature virus. prM acts as a chaperone, sitting over the fusion loop of E and preventing premature triggering. As the virion exits the cell, prM is proteolytically processed, allowing the E protein to rearrange into 90 head-to-tail homodimers. Conversely, during viral entry, following absorption into cells mediated by domain III of the E protein, flaviviruses are endocytosed and traffic to acidified endosomes. E homodimers are triggered by low pH to rearrange into homotrimers, exposing the hydrophobic fusion loop in domain II of the E protein and driving membrane fusion and viral entry. The primary humoral immune response to DENV is dominated by antibodies targeting prM and domain I and II of E. Many of these antibodies are cross-reactive in that they can bind multiple DENV serotypes. However, they do not represent broadly protective responses because they lack neutralization potency, while possessing the ability to promote antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (3, 4) . In contrast, domain III of E (EDIII)-specific antibodies constitutes a minor component of the overall human humoral response but may be potently neutralizing. Recently, Robinson et al. used structure-guided design to optimize an existing EDIII antibody (1). Starting with a potent MAb that targeted a conserved epitope within DENV EDIII, a network map of individual interactions between the paratope and epitope was built. Through experimental mutation of the paratope, in particular, within the complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H1, followed by further structural analysis, the antibody was optimized to maximize affinity. This gave rise to Ab513, a potent pan-serotype MAb that neutralizes all four serotypes with reduced virus-enhancing activity compared to the parental antibody. Importantly, the use of Ab513 is therapeutically effective in animal models of DENV pathogenesis. Such studies have offered an exciting roadmap for careful crafting of paratope/ epitope interactions using structure-guided design not only to maximize affinity but also to broaden specificity. For such studies, it is critical to have high-resolution structures of viral particles and/or envelope proteins in native conformations. It is also helpful to have extensive mapping of the antibody-accessible envelope surfaces with large panels of MAbs.",22.445881875818184,10.322945623956942

In the indirect ELISA ( http://www.paho. org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=10 &Itemid=40743 ), a known antigen is fi xed to the bottom of a plastic surface, usually a multi-well plate.

The plates are then washed and a detection antibody (usually an anti-IgG or anti-IgM antibody) that is conjugated to a substrate-specifi c enzyme is applied to each well. After washing, a substrate is then applied and is converted by the enzyme conjugated to the detector antibody, typically resulting in a colorimetric change. The intensity of this change provides a semiquantitative measurement of the presence of the antigen-specifi c antibody. To detect an antigen, a sandwich ELISA is used in which a capture antibody (one which is specifi c for the antigen of interest) is bound to the plates. The patient's serum is applied and if antigen is present, it is bound by the capture assay. The plates are then washed and antigen-specifi c antibodies are applied-creating an antibody-antigen-antibody sandwich.

The peptides were conjugated to a carrier protein known as Cross reacting material (CRM), a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin (DT). Peptide 11 CRM-conjugate vaccine was administered subcutaneously as a prime boost with live influenza A(H3N2) (Wuhan) administered intramuscularly at a dose of 10 6 . After priming with live influenza virus on Day 0 and 14, the mice were injected subcutaneously with 20-μg peptide 11 composite vaccine on days 30, 42, and 70. The immunological response was assessed using individual peptides and viruses including influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2). The initial immunologic response was low, but became more robust over time peaking at day 77. The second subunit vaccine (5906) is a composite vaccine that contains M2e peptide sequences, a tetanus T-cell epitope sequence, and is conjugated to CRM. This vaccine (50 μg) was administered subcutaneously with no prime boost and the mice were given boosts on days 21, 35 and 41. There was a robust immune response observed starting at day 21 and maximal at day 42. Based on the analytical results, it was concluded that the peptide composite vaccines are highly immunogenic and elicited strong humoral responses in mice. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) GA4 was isolated and characterized by assessing its binding profile to a range of influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) strains. Monoclonal antibodies were identified that bound to individual and composite peptides and live viruses, while also showing cross neutralizing potential against influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) in the microneutralization assay. mAb GA4, along with other monoclonal antibodies that bind HA and NA protein, are being evaluated for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity.",14.391648258983906,8.293208748277959

This phenomenon, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection, is also considered as an obstacle to PRRSV vaccine development, although the underlying mechanism remains elusive (Christianson et al., 1993; Shibata et al., 1998; Tirado and Yoon, 2003) . Recent studies of ADE mechanisms from other RNA viruses have suggested that, in addition to enhancing viral uptake, ADE may suppress the innate antiviral response, especially type I IFN system of the host (Mahalingam and Lidbury, 2002) . Moreover, ADE enables the viruses to benefit from the antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive environment created by autocrine and paracrine IL-10 production (Berlato et al., 2002; Ito et al., 1999; Mahalingam and Lidbury, 2002) . Since production of IL-10 were significantly increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of PRRSV-infected pigs (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2004) , it is speculated that, in the course of ADE of PRRSV infection, stronger up-regulation of IL-10 would occur in PAM, which may contribute to down-regulating the production of IFN-␣/␤ and other inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, attenuating or eliminating the negative effects of ADE that may be induced by vaccination should be considered as a key factor for novel PRRSV vaccine development.",43.93647343871923,18.175210008375608

Ribavirin is highly active against RSV in vitro, and aerosolized ribavirin has been shown to reduce viral shedding and shorten the course of illness in some but not all studies. Aerosolized ribavirin is currently recommended for use only in selected infants and young children who are at high risk for serious RSV disease. 262 In immunosuppressed patients, particularly hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, both aerosolized ribavirin and high-dose oral ribavirin have been used for early treatment to prevent progression to pneumonia. 263 Recent studies suggest that intermittent aerosolized ribavirin is as effective as continuous aerosolized ribavirin in these patients. 264 Once RSV pneumonia has developed, intravenous ribavirin alone is ineffective but, if treatment is initiated before the onset of respiratory failure, combinations of aerosolized ribavirin with intravenous immunoglobulin, and particularly paluvizumab (see later) may be beneficial. 265, 266 In adults, short courses of systemic corticosteroids for RSV-related wheezing did not affect viral loads or shedding and only mildly diminished antibody responses. 267 An effective vaccine for prevention of RSV has not yet been developed. In a study of formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine conducted in the 1960s, vaccinated infants developed more severe disease compared with unvaccinated children. 268 The mechanisms of this enhancement remain uncertain, although studies in those vaccine recipients and in rodent models have implicated low levels or low affinity of the antibodies induced by the formalin-inactivated vaccine, which permitted excessive cytolytic T-cell responses to develop and cause tissue damage. Low-affinity antibodies may also have contributed to immune complex formation and deposition, leading to local inflammation. 269, 270 Formalin-inactivated RSV also primes a T helper 2 response, with high levels of interleukin 4 and interleukin 5, which can promote inflammation of small airways. 271 Although this adverse experience has prompted extra caution, current RSV vaccine development efforts are ongoing and focus on live attenuated and recombinant subunit vaccines.",18.674193129305042,12.223862774051625

This review describes how antibodies operate in the early stages of infection to direct viruses to target cells (dengue virus) or modify antigen presentation to form nonneutralizing antibodies (RSV). Critical to differences in antibody-mediated outcomes are the different principal host cells supporting infection in these two diseases. Mononuclear phagocytes are target cells for diseases initiated by ADE, while in RSV and measles virus it is likely that parenchymal lung epithelial cells support infection with limited involvement of mononuclear phagocytes. These two rather different examples of antibody-dependent viral immunopathology are unified by their interaction with the innate immune system. In both, innate immune responses of viral target or antigen-presenting cells have been modified so as to impede the potential beneficial responses that accompany and follow human infection or vaccination.

Generally, virus-specific antibodies play important roles in the control of viral infections. However, the presence of specific antibodies can be beneficial for infection in case of some viruses including flaviviruses, CoVs, and retroviruses (de Alwis et al. 2014; Jolly and Weiss 2000; Takano et al. 2008) . Vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to SARS-CoV has been documented.

These recombinant viruses were used for immunization and subsequent virus challenge of kittens. Those authors indicated that only the peplomer protein might be responsible for this phenomenon [26, 27] . FIPV type II has been preferentially used for experimental materials, probably because the proliferative efficiency of FIPV type II in cultured cells is much higher than that of type I. Thus, type I has been little investigated, especially at the molecular biological level. Therefore, it seems important to study FIPV type I, which is more prevalent in Japan than type II.

In ADE, virus-specific antibodies enhance the entry of the virus into, and in some cases, its replication within T cells, monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells, through interactions with Fc and/or complement receptors. A significant, 4 log-fold or even greater increase in the in vitro production of several viruses was observed following exposure to low-affinity antibodies [7] . ADE of infection has been described for numerous viruses belonging to different families and orders as reviewed [8, 9] .

Furthermore, the balance of ''good'' and ''bad'' antibodies changes during the progression of HIV disease, and ''bad'', enhancing antibodies become predominant in the advanced stage. This issue was addressed by the elegant study of Subbramanian et al. [43] .

For example, complement-dependent enhancing antibodies were detected in two trials: in 11 of 19 volunteers [53] , and in 6/24 subjects [54] vaccinated with high dose (640 g) of a HIV-1 gp160 candidate vaccine. Indirect evidence indicates that enhancing type antibodies could have developed during recent phase III vaccine trials as well. Gilbert et al. [55] have recently reported on the correlation between immunological responses to the recombinant gp120 vaccine and the incidence of HIV-1 infection in a phase 3 vaccine trial. They found that vaccinees who developed low antibody responses had a slightly, but significantly higher chance of becoming infected, than placebo recipients. In Caucasian recipients, this odds ratio was as high as 2.20 (1.29-3.74; p = 0.004), and 2.00 (1.22-3.29; p = 0.006) for MN CD4 blocking and for GNE8 V2-binding antibodies, respectively. On the other hand, even the high antibody response appeared to fail to protect vaccinees against HIV-1 infection. The authors put forward two alternative explanations of their findings: (a) the vaccine induced an immune response that enhanced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in low responders and (b) differing antibody responses to rgp120 merely identified the diverse capabilities of vaccinees to resist HIV-1 infection [55] . In the discussion of their paper, they weighed the relative plausibility of the two explanations, but could not decide. In accordance with the Editorial Comment by Graham and Mascola [56] , we would like to discuss the possibility, corroborated by the abundance of literature data summarized above, that antibody-mediated enhancement may develop and can diminish or abrogate the beneficial effects of the vaccine or can even be harmful for vaccinated volunteers.

The absence of histopathological change in the lungs of the challenge group is an indication of the absence of immune pathology in ferrets. The increase in neutralizing antibodies from 7 to 14 d.p.i. correlated with a decrease in viral burden observed in the lung, nasal turbinates, nasal swab and pharyngeal swab samples. Upon challenge one month after primary infection, a significant increase of antibody titers was observed and the antibody titer was higher than that seen after primary infection.

First, there is a precedent for coronavirus-vaccine associated disease enhancement; kittens immunized with a vaccinia virus vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus vaccines developed severe disease when they were subsequently infected with FIPV [65] . In these kittens, non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies facilitated viral entry into macrophages. The concern that is extrapolated from the FIPV vaccine experience to human SARS-CoV vaccines is whether vaccine recipients will develop more severe disease if they are exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV after neutralizing antibody titers decline. The second concern is whether recipients of a SARS-CoV vaccine would be at risk of developing pulmonary immunopathology following infection with an unrelated human coronavirus, for example, 229E, OC43, HKU1 or NL63 that usually causes mild, self limited disease.

One of the key functions of an- or more are associated with protection from influenza virus infection and are often used as markers of successful immunization in influenza vaccine trials (23, 30) . During the first few days of an infection, the neutralizing antibody titers are often low (34) . However, the magnitude of nonneutralizing antibodies during this period has not been studied. We hypothesized that the nonneutralizing antibodies in the early stage of infection may play a role in the outcome of an infection. To detect nonneutralizing antibodies, we used an ELISA plate coated with a split-virion inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 virus vaccine as antigen, which could detect both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies against the vaccine proteins. We showed that within 2 to 4 days after symptom onset, significantly higher ELISA titers were found for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease, but there was no significant difference in their MN titers. The ELISA/MN titer ratio, which is a surrogate marker for the amount of nonneutralizing antibody, was higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease. Patients requiring PPV, representing those who had the most severe respiratory disease, had higher ELISA titers than those who did not require PPV. The results from our study suggested that an exaggerated nonneutralizing antibody response during the early stage of infection was associated with severe disease. The nonneutralizing antibody present in patients during the early stage of infection was likely to be preexisting or was the result of a secondary heterotypic antibody response against conserved epitopes, which may be found outside the receptor binding pocket of HA or in the highly conserved nucleoprotein, matrix proteins, and polymerase proteins, or even the less conserved NS proteins (11) . This early IgG response can happen within a few days after infection because of immune priming by previous exposure to similar viral epitopes. In our ELISA, we used a split-virion inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine as the coating antigen, and it contained mainly HA but also other proteins of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, including the neuraminidase, the matrix protein, and the nucleoprotein (4). The matrix proteins and nucleoprotein have conserved amino acid sequences, and therefore antibodies against these proteins from prior seasonal influenza virus infection or vaccination could be induced. Upon infection with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, memory B cells can proliferate rapidly and generate a large amount of these highavidity nonneutralizing antibodies, especially in patients with severe disease. This is consistent with the observation that the number of peripheral blood B cells is higher in patients with severe disease than in those with mild disease during the early stage of infection (14) . Nonneutralizing antibodies against influenza virus can have either protective, neutral nonprotective, or detrimental effects. Antibodies against the M2 ectodomain and the nucleoprotein have been shown to be protective in animal models (2, 10, 19, 21) . On the other hand, antibodies against NS1 have been shown to delay viral clearance (21) . This is consistent with the previous finding that a delay in viral clearance rather than a high initial viral load in the respiratory tract is associated with severe disease (37, 38) . Antibodies against PB1-F2 and M1 can be detected in patients with influenza virus infection, but the functional significance of these antibodies is unknown (20, 52) . Other potential effects of nonneutralizing antibody include the activation of the complement cascade and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, which can be protective or detrimental if excessively proinflammatory (1, 27) . Besides the uncertainty of these effects on the clinical outcome, the avidity of such nonneutralizing antibodies for complement activation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity is also unknown. If these effects turn out to be detrimental, it is conceivable that such nonneutralizing antibodies with high avidity would produce more damage to patients than antibodies with low avidity. Though the notion that prior seasonal influenza vaccination is associated with worse outcomes for patients with subsequent A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has been disputed, nonneutralizing antibodies may play a role if this is indeed the case (33) . Detrimental effects of nonneutralizing antibody have been speculated to be associated with poor outcomes of dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles virus infections via antibody-dependent enhancement (42) . Though the laboratory phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement has also been shown for influenza virus, no clinical study has ever been performed to ascertain the link (35) . The pro-or anti-inflammatory effects of nonneutralizing antibody in the pathogenesis and outcome of influenza should be investigated further (3) .",25.041972113051852,12.012018675942812

Furthermore, use of MDCK cells for both influenza virus isolation and production may provide vaccines that are a closer antigenic match to influenza strains circulating in the human population than vaccines in which virus strains are isolated in eggs [29, 30] . A closer antigenic match may result in an improved immunogenic response in vaccine recipients.",17.324213599839375,10.85379104364663

The influenza vaccine coverage rate in the United States was 60%, and vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 62% for the 2013-2014 influenza season [15] . Despite the consistent inclusion of A(H1N1)pdm09 in the vaccine formulations since 2010, A(H1N1)pdm09 became the dominant strain isolated from patients with influenza in the 2013-2014 influenza season for the first time since 2010. Moreover, changes in the antigenicity of the circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 were not detected in 2013-2014 [15] , suggesting a lack of immunological selective pressure on the circulating virus. In the current study, we collected blood samples from patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed acute A(H1N1)pdm09 infection during the 2013-2014 influenza season and generated plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAbs) [16] . PPAbs are representative of the overall antibody repertoire of infection-or vaccination-activated B cells; analysis of these antibodies avoids interference by preexisting cross-reactive serum antibodies, a pitfall difficult to avoid when using serum-based assays. Reactivities of PPAbs from these infected patients and from recipients of IIV to proteins from the infecting virus and from heterovariant and heterosubtypic influenza virus strains were examined. In addition, priming of the immune system by natural infection versus IIV immunization was evaluated by examining the PPAb response to a subsequent immunization with IIV. To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of the characteristics of B-cell responses in natural influenza virus infection versus responses to IIV immunization at the polyclonal level.",16.706500072913414,10.43844072309431

One possible explanation for the late detection of NAbs is the difference on technique sensitivity, as ELISA has higher sensitivity than neutralization assays. Therefore, the presence of very low titers of NAbs early in the infection cannot be completely discarded. Early non-neutralizing antibodies are mainly induced by nucleocapsid (N), M and GP5 proteins, and have been involved in antibody-dependent enhancement of PRRSV infection (Mateu and Diaz, 2008; Murtaugh et al., 2002) . NAbs are induced by GP3, GP4, GP5 and M proteins, although the ones recognizing GP5 are the most relevant for protection (Kim and Yoon, 2008; Ostrowski et al., 2002) . Two B cell epitopes were identified in GP5 protein ectodomain: an immunodominant epitope (IDE), that has been proposed to act as a decoy epitope, and an epitope critical for neutralization (ECN), that is recognized by NAbs (Ostrowski et al., 2002) . Several hypothesis have been proposed to explain the delay in NAbs induction by GP5 protein, such as the presence of the IDE, and glican-shielding of the ECN (Lopez and Osorio, 2004) . The role of NAbs in protection was demonstrated by passive transfer of these antibodies . Protection of swine against PRRSV infection correlated with the level of NAbs and it was proposed that an efficient vaccine must induce NAb titers of 1:32 to prevent PRRSV infection (Lopez et al., 2007) .",20.559677097322197,9.114987799120524

Administration of psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid (0.25 to 0.5 kg/500 kg in 4 to 8 L of water by stomach tube) may facilitate passage of sand. One should administer the solution rapidly because it will form a viscous gel. An alternative method of administration is to mix psyllium with 2 L of mineral oil, which will not form a gel and can be pumped through a nasogastric tube easily. One then pumps 2 to 4 L of water through the tube. The psyllium separates from the oil phase and mixes with the water, forming a gel within the gastrointestinal tract. Psyllium is thought to act by stimulating motility or by agglutinating the sand. However, a recent experimental study failed to show a benefit of this treatment for clearing sand from the colons of otherwise normal horses. 98 If a severe impaction is present, one should not give the psyllium until softening the impaction by administrating intravenous or oral fluids and other laxatives. Perforation is a potential complication in horses with sand impactions because the sand stretches and irritates the intestinal wall and causes inflammation. Therefore if colic becomes intractable, one should perform surgical evacuation of the large colon. The prognosis is generally good. 94, 95 ",14.995179568008638,8.101653915640334

If an antibody binds to the antigen weakly, then the addition of urea will disrupt the binding, resulting in a lower OD value. We have shown that higher antibody avidities are independently associated with severe disease. This is consistent with our finding that patients with severe disease have higher levels of secondary antibody production, presumably from memory B cells. Our finding appears to contradict a study by Monsalvo et al., who showed that patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection had lower antibody avidity than those with mild disease (28) . Several groups have also examined the relationship between age and antibody avidity in patients with natural infection, and they have shown that antibody avidity is higher in older than in younger age groups (28, 44) . For antibody responses after influenza vaccination, one study showed a higher antibody avidity in the elderly than in younger vaccine recipients, while another study did not find any differences (18, 32) . In our study, we did not find any correlation between age and antibody avidity. There are several important differences between other studies and ours which may explain the discrepancy of the results. First, we examined the serum antibodies that were present shortly after a natural infection, which are probably different from the antibodies arising in the convalescent phase after natural infection or vaccination. Second, we used a split-virion influenza vaccine, which contains HA and other viral proteins, while other studies used pure recombinant HA without other viral proteins. There may be differences in avidity for antibodies directed against HA but not for those against other viral proteins. Finally, a sampling bias may have occurred in the severe cases, because for those patients who died early on, no sera could be collected in the convalescent phase.",17.455763856707332,7.832074790247689

However, reports of immunopathologic reactions in older mice and in non-human primates vaccinated with SARS-CoV vaccines that were subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [57, 59, 62, 64] have revealed two concerns about proceeding to clinical trials with SARS-CoV vaccines. First, there is a precedent for coronavirus-vaccine associated disease enhancement; kittens immunized with a vaccinia virus vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus vaccines developed severe disease when they were subsequently infected with FIPV [65] . In these kittens, non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies facilitated viral entry into macrophages. The concern that is extrapolated from the FIPV vaccine experience to human SARS-CoV vaccines is whether vaccine recipients will develop more severe disease if they are exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV after neutralizing antibody titers decline. The second concern is whether recipients of a SARSCoV vaccine would be at risk of developing pulmonary immunopathology following infection with an unrelated human coronavirus e.g. 229E, OC43, HKU1 or NL63 that usually causes mild, self limited disease. Although findings from preclinical evaluation have revealed these concerns, studies in animal models may not be able to provide data to confirm or allay these concerns. Factors to consider when selecting an animal model. Animal models should be tailored to the goals of the study. If the primary goal is to elucidate pathogenesis, the model should replicate key aspects of the disease and immunological reagents should be available. The demographic background (e.g. age for SARS) of the animal should be taken into consideration. In contrast, animal models used in vaccine/antiviral efficacy studies must demonstrate meaningful differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated control groups. Special consideration should be given to how animals from different demographic backgrounds respond to the vaccine/antiviral under investigation. To determine the correlate of protection, it is necessary to study the immune response to the vaccine as well as the immune response elicited after challenge with the homologous coronavirus. It may be of interest to evaluate the response to challenge with other coronaviruses that the vaccinated host may encounter. Gretebeck Table 1 Coronaviruses associated with disease in humans.

In addition, vaccine formats that might be capable of eliciting strong RSV-neutralizing serum antibody responses in children, comparable to those achieved with antibody immunoprophylaxis (such as parenteral administration of properly folded viral protein subunits formulated with adjuvant), would be difficult to clinically develop, at least in part, because of concerns that these vaccines may potentiate RSV disease. In the 1960s, a formalin-inactivated, alum-adjuvanted whole-virus vaccine was tested in infants and children; however, it not only failed to protect against RSV disease but also resulted in immune-mediated disease enhancement 46 .

In 2015, patent application WO2015042373 by Novavax disclosed an immunogenic composition composed of MERS-CoV nanoparticle VLPs containing at least one trimer of a S protein, produced by baculovirus overexpression in Sf9 cells. This VLP preparation induced a neutralizing antibody response in mice and transgenic cattle, when administered along with their proprietary adjuvant Matrix M (RN 1235341-17-9 ). In addition, preparations of sera from vaccinated cattle (SAB-300 or SAB-301) were injected into Ad5-hDPP4 transduced BALB/c mice prior to challenge with MERS-CoV. Both SAB-300 and SAB-301 were able to protect these mice from MERS-CoV infection with a single prophylactic injection. Novavax announced on February 26, 2020 54 that it was beginning animal testing on potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates due to their previous experiences working with other coronaviruses, including both MERS and SARS.

This presents two major obstacles. First, the neutralizing target antigens (prM and E) must be in their natural conformations to present their receptor binding sites where the neutralizing epitopes reside. Protein antigens synthesized in nonmammalian cell culture are not fully glycosylated and are folded differently; even antigens produced in mammalian cells are denatured during the purification process. Therefore, these antigens often do not induce strong neutralizing responses. Second, it requires presenting antigens of all four serotype dengue viruses at similar ratios to prevent underrepresentation of any one of the four serotypes. This has been particularly difficult to achieve even with live attenuated virus vaccines because each virus is attenuated differently. Furthermore, each attenuated virus may behave differently in different people or populations. Overattenuation may cause a subtype to be underrepresented and cause im-mune enhancement; underattenuation will cause infection in some individuals by the vaccine as seen in the recently halted phase III clinical trials (17) .",13.298800326263319,7.86940470725933

This type of cross-reactive antibody was found within responses directed not just to one but to many different virus proteins on both of the two major structurally distinct forms of poxviruses (mature virions [MV] and enveloped virions [EV] ). MAbs isolated from humans with prior chikungunya virus infection included mAbs that recognize all major pathogenic alphaviruses (Fox et al., 2015) .

While observational studies on dengue virus (DENV) infections revealed a significant association between severe illness and antibody responses in secondary infection (Halstead et al. 1967) , in vitro experiments demonstrated increased infectivity of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (Hawkes 1964; Hawkes and Lafferty 1967) and DENV (Halstead et al. 1973a) in the presence of antibody. In vivo studies in rhesus monkeys showing association of antibody response with higher dengue viremia offered further supportive evidence for this phenomenon (Halstead et al. 1973b; Halstead 1979; Marchette et al. 1973) . ADE ensues when antibodies binding to the virus particle fail to efficiently neutralize the virus (Halstead 2003; Taylor et al. 2015) . This may occur due to the nonneutralizing nature of the antibody (binding to viral epitopes other than those involved in cell attachment and entry) or the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies (binding to viral epitopes below the threshold for neutralization). Either way, these antibodies aid entry of the virus into target cells, resulting in enhancement of viral infection, known as antibody-dependent enhancement ( Fig. 2.1.) . The mechanism of ADE involves internalization of virus-antibody immune complexes into cells via interaction of the antibody Fc region with the cellular Fc receptors (FcRs). Consequently, FcR-bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and certain granulocytes are permissive to ADE of infection, through phagocytic uptake of the immune complexes.

Utilizing in vitro assays designed to measure ADE of dengue virus infection, researchers discovered that the presence of fresh serum could completely abolish ADE (Mehlhop et al., 2007; Yamanaka et al., 2008) . Further analyses demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of fresh serum on ADE was C1q-dependent and antibody isotypespecific (Mehlhop et al., 2007; Yamanaka et al., 2008) . However, in separate studies the suppression of ADE by fresh serum was found to be C3-dependent or C3-independent, thus the extent to which other complement components participate in mediating these effects is unclear. In addition to suppressing ADE, C1q was shown to enhance the neutralizing activity of anti-WNV antibodies (Mehlhop et al., 2009) . Mechanistic studies revealed that C1q reduced the number of antibodies required to bind a WNV virion and neutralize infectivity. Interestingly, C1q reduced the number of antibodies required for neutralization to levels below the minimum number required for ADE. Importantly, the ability of an anti-WNV antibody to protect from lethal infection was decreased in C1q −/− mice compared to wild-type mice, indicating that C1q enhancement of neutralizing activity regulates WNV pathogenesis. In contrast to the effect of C1q on ADE of flavivirus infection, ADE of Ebola Zaire virus infection is C1qdependent . The glycoprotein of the Reston strain of Ebola virus, which is less pathogenic in humans, induces less enhancing activity compared to the Zaire strain, suggesting that ADE may also play a role in Ebola virus pathogenesis.",40.63748885960222,18.38902606387729

These trials had demonstrated high vaccine efficacy among 9-16-year-olds during the first 2 years after vaccine (first of three doses) administration, but indicated increased risk of hospitalized dengue in the 2-5 year age group during the third year of follow-up. These results suggested the possibility of the vaccine sensitizing dengue seronegatives to subsequent enhanced DENV infection and disease. However, considering the population-level benefits in reducing disease burden, the vaccine was approved by WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization, with recommendations for use in dengue-endemic regions with ≥70% seroprevalence and administration to individuals in the age range of 9-45 years. This approval was followed by additional studies to investigate the long-term benefitrisk ratio of dengue vaccination in seronegative population. These studies revealed that vaccine performance was indeed affected by serostatus, with vaccine efficacy being significantly higher in seropositives than seronegatives. Furthermore, an increased risk of hospitalized, severe dengue was observed among seronegative vaccine recipients as compared to seronegative controls (Sridhar et al. 2018) .

One of the key functions of an- or more are associated with protection from influenza virus infection and are often used as markers of successful immunization in influenza vaccine trials (23, 30) . During the first few days of an infection, the neutralizing antibody titers are often low (34) . However, the magnitude of nonneutralizing antibodies during this period has not been studied. We hypothesized that the nonneutralizing antibodies in the early stage of infection may play a role in the outcome of an infection. To detect nonneutralizing antibodies, we used an ELISA plate coated with a split-virion inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 virus vaccine as antigen, which could detect both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies against the vaccine proteins. We showed that within 2 to 4 days after symptom onset, significantly higher ELISA titers were found for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease, but there was no significant difference in their MN titers. The ELISA/MN titer ratio, which is a surrogate marker for the amount of nonneutralizing antibody, was higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease. Patients requiring PPV, representing those who had the most severe respiratory disease, had higher ELISA titers than those who did not require PPV. The results from our study suggested that an exaggerated nonneutralizing antibody response during the early stage of infection was associated with severe disease. The nonneutralizing antibody present in patients during the early stage of infection was likely to be preexisting or was the result of a secondary heterotypic antibody response against conserved epitopes, which may be found outside the receptor binding pocket of HA or in the highly conserved nucleoprotein, matrix proteins, and polymerase proteins, or even the less conserved NS proteins (11) . This early IgG response can happen within a few days after infection because of immune priming by previous exposure to similar viral epitopes. In our ELISA, we used a split-virion inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine as the coating antigen, and it contained mainly HA but also other proteins of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, including the neuraminidase, the matrix protein, and the nucleoprotein (4). The matrix proteins and nucleoprotein have conserved amino acid sequences, and therefore antibodies against these proteins from prior seasonal influenza virus infection or vaccination could be induced. Upon infection with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, memory B cells can proliferate rapidly and generate a large amount of these highavidity nonneutralizing antibodies, especially in patients with severe disease. This is consistent with the observation that the number of peripheral blood B cells is higher in patients with severe disease than in those with mild disease during the early stage of infection (14) . Nonneutralizing antibodies against influenza virus can have either protective, neutral nonprotective, or detrimental effects. Antibodies against the M2 ectodomain and the nucleoprotein have been shown to be protective in animal models (2, 10, 19, 21) . On the other hand, antibodies against NS1 have been shown to delay viral clearance (21) . This is consistent with the previous finding that a delay in viral clearance rather than a high initial viral load in the respiratory tract is associated with severe disease (37, 38) . Antibodies against PB1-F2 and M1 can be detected in patients with influenza virus infection, but the functional significance of these antibodies is unknown (20, 52) . Other potential effects of nonneutralizing antibody include the activation of the complement cascade and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, which can be protective or detrimental if excessively proinflammatory (1, 27) . Besides the uncertainty of these effects on the clinical outcome, the avidity of such nonneutralizing antibodies for complement activation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity is also unknown. If these effects turn out to be detrimental, it is conceivable that such nonneutralizing antibodies with high avidity would produce more damage to patients than antibodies with low avidity. Though the notion that prior seasonal influenza vaccination is associated with worse outcomes for patients with subsequent A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has been disputed, nonneutralizing antibodies may play a role if this is indeed the case (33) . Detrimental effects of nonneutralizing antibody have been speculated to be associated with poor outcomes of dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles virus infections via antibody-dependent enhancement (42) . Though the laboratory phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement has also been shown for influenza virus, no clinical study has ever been performed to ascertain the link (35) . The pro-or anti-inflammatory effects of nonneutralizing antibody in the pathogenesis and outcome of influenza should be investigated further (3) .",25.355257490309683,12.121668557983051

During primary infection, the body develops immune responses in the form of antibodies against the particular serotype attacked (Schmid et al., 2016) . But the main complexity of DENV arises during the secondary infection with another serotype, leading to serious version of dengue infection like Dengue Haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) (Dar and Ghosh, 2015; Matheus et al., 2005; Schmid et al., 2016) . This is caused due to the antibodies produced during primary attack which complicate the secondary DENV infection by a phenomenon known as Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) (Durbin and Whitehead, 2011; Flipse et al., 2016) . During ADE, there is a cross reaction between the antibodies of the primary infection and virus of secondary infection such that there is an increased infection in macrophages and monocytes (Whitehorn and Simmons, 2011; Durbin et al., 2010) . These challenges bring the importance of an archetypal dengue vaccine which can provide life time immunity against all the serotypes (Thomas, 2011; Russell and Halstead, 2016) . Currently, the vaccine candidates that are under various stages of clinical trial are the live attenuated viruses (Thomas et al., 2012) , chimeric vaccine (Guy et al., 2015) , recombinant vaccine with adjuvants (Hertz et al., 2017) , reverse vaccinology (Baliga et al., 2018) , purified and inactivated virions (Fernandez et al., 2015) , subunit proteins and plasmid DNA (Thisyakorn and Thisyakorn, 2014) . Among these, live attenuated DENGVAXIA or CYD-TDV, a tetravalent chimeric dengue vaccine (Scott, 2016) , developed by Sanofi Pasteur in December 2015, is the first licensed vaccine in some Asian and Latin American countries (Pitisuttithum and Bouckenooghe, 2016; Flaschw et al., 2016) . These clinical manifestations caused by the vaccine are ascribed to inefficiency of the vaccine in producing competent T-cells that protect against DENV disease (Kim et al., 2010) . Moreover, the vaccine does not encode any non-structural proteins which are required by the virus to evade immune response of the host (Halstead, 2017; Morrison et al., 2012) . All these studies imply that a vaccine that is tetravalent and simultaneously prevents antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) needs to be designed urgently. These concerns led to the need for a relatively new technique of vaccine development i.e. Epitope or synthetic peptide based vaccines.

The Human Antibody Response Against WNV,"Experimental evidence has suggested that antibodies against E-protein domain II of flaviviruses can, under certain conditions, enhance infectivity of WNV in vitro Pierson et al., 2007) . In animal models, sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies against a related flaviviruses resulted in lower levels of survival compared to animals that were treated with a control antibody (Hawkes and Lafferty, 1967) , and the administration of nonprotective YF mAb at the time of YF or JEV virus challenge was shown to enhance neurovirulence (Gould and Buckley, 1989) . In humans, a serious hemorrhagic disease is associated with previous exposure to a heterologous subtype of dengue (Cardosa, 1998; Halstead, 1988) . This process called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is thought to result from the internalization and productive infection of macrophages and other myeloid cells through Fc-g receptors (Cardosa et al., 1986; Iankov et al., 2006; Takada and Kawaoka, 2003; Tirado and Yoon, 2003) . In a similar way, complement fixation and viral uptake through complement receptors on macrophages have also been associated with enhanced infectivity (Cardosa et al., 1986; Tirado and Yoon, 2003) . A significant proportion of non-neutralizing mAbs (~30%) isolated from the WNV-immune repertoire above bound to an epitope depending on the homodimeric form of the E-protein and were particularly active in fixing the complement (Throsby et al., 2006) . Thus, the most commonly identified antibodies from the human antibody repertoire could, in theory, enhance infection via mechanisms that allow the virus to be internalized by a larger number of cell types. It is important to note that enhancement of WNV infection has also been demonstrated in vitro for the very potent anti-E-protein domain III-neutralizing antibodies at low concentration and that neutralization and enhancement activity overlap ; however, this finding has not been reproduced experimentally in vivo (Engle and Diamond, 2003) .",32.25156126387532,13.975460611667884

At the present time, no practical method of immunization has been reported. Cats immunized with virulence-attenuated live or inactivated FIPV are not protected against virulent FIPV challenge-exposure [t5, 20] . Cats immunized with closely related coronaviruses, such as feline 208 T. Hohdatsu etal. enteric coronavirus (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), are also sensitive to exposure to virulent F I P V [2, 16, 18, 22, 29] .

This, for instance, is the case of mAbs targeting the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV (and other lenti-/retroviruses) that is exposed at the surface of virus-producing cells. Finally, Fc-FcgR interactions can also directly impact viral propagation via a mechanism called antibodydependent, cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI) (see [19, [25] [26] [27] for more information on direct Fc-mediated antiviral effects). Thus, during immunotherapies, mAbs can impact viral propagation via a variety of direct mechanisms, possibly varying according to the virus, the viral antigen recognized and the antibody itself. However, there is now accumulating evidence that antiviral mAbs, upon interaction with different components of the immune system, can also operate via indirect mechanisms, that is, engagement of the host immune response, with effects lasting well beyond the treatment itself. Thus, similarly to vaccine approaches, mAb treatment could lead to the stimulation of the endogenous humoral and cellular immune responses in such a manner as to provide protective immunity ('vaccine-like effects').",15.604313752752926,8.621763469374017

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been observed during FIP-CoV infection [7] and may be part of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection. Disease associated with SARS-CoV infection results from immune-mediated infiltration of the airways by lymphocytes and macrophages. Enhanced disease should be marked by increased viral titer after prior exposure to the virus or virus components. In the case of FIP, the virus gains entry into macrophage cells via neutralizing antibodies to the spike envelope protein, which bind the virus and are internalized by the cell. Macrophages have been shown to be virally infected in patients with SARS, and the concern is that these macrophages provide an additional host substrate in which the virus may grow. Furthermore, early and more robust seroconversion has been associated with more severe disease in patients with SARS, implicating SARS as an immune-mediated disease [25] . If SARS-CoV gains entry to macrophages through antibodies, then vaccines that elicit these responses may not be safe. We purposely designed a weak vaccine that elicited a mild antibody response to test the possibility that low antibody titers are associated with enhanced pulmonary disease as opposed to a strong antibody response, which should be completely protective. We did not see an increase in viral titer in vaccinated ferrets versus mock-vaccinated ferrets, and the vaccine did not induce ADE. This suggests that, under these conditions, an inactivated whole-virus vaccine can provide some measure of protection without the risk of enhanced lung or liver disease. Still needed are kinetic studies to show that infected ferrets are protected from further infection in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the role played by the level of the immune response in ADE needs to be analyzed.",40.695390615294826,20.0730537590391

However, most of the evidence is taken from limited data from in vitro and animal experiments. The interpretation of these findings with regard to implications for human disease is not clear. Concerns over the safety of SARS vaccines came from a previous animal study in which ADE was observed in domestic cats after vaccination against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) (Vennema et al. 1990 ). Moreover, ferrets that are immunized with MVA vaccine expressing S protein suffer hepatitis whilst failing to develop protection (Weingartl et al. 2004 ). In addition, some variants of SARS-CoV are resistant to antibody neutralization, but the infection is enhanced by antibodies against a different variant (Yang et al. 2005b) . Under in vitro conditions, entry into human B-cell lines by SARS-CoV virus could be carried out in an FcgRII-dependent and ACE2-independent fashion, indicating that ADE of virus entry is an alternative cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV (Kam et al. 2007) . However, there is no direct evidence that patients with SARS have had previous exposure to a related virus. Likewise, there is no evidence of enhanced disease in the lungs of animals that are infected with SARS-CoV following passive transfer of antibodies against SARS-CoV induced by infection or immunization. Also, macrophages are not productively infected by SARS-CoV Bisht et al. 2004; Stadler et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2004b; Greenough et al. 2005; Kam et al. 2007 ).

The difference is that this virus does not exhibit very high variability, and is therefore more tractable. Similar approaches are likely to be essential for developing efficient immunogens to use in a subunit vaccine against other enveloped viruses from the other classes. Important examples are the human pathogenic Epstein-Barr virus and the cytomegalovirus, belonging to the Herpesviridae family, for which a structure of the prefusion form of their class III fusion protein would be extremely valuable as a target for vaccine design, and where specific stabilization of the pre-fusion form is an absolute requirement. The Dengue Viruses As discussed above, for class II viruses the situation is different as the prefusion form of the fusion protein is involved in formation of a glycoprotein shell surrounding the viral membrane. Parallels still exist, as indicated by the flavivirus data, and in particular for the four dengue virus serotypes, where heterotypic secondary infection is the greatest risk factor for severe dengue disease (Katzelnick et al., 2017) . The antibodies elicited during a primary infection normally protect from subsequent autologous infection; however, these antibodies also bind heterologous virus without neutralizing it. The resulting opsonized particles are efficiently internalized via Fcg receptors into macrophages and other cells of the immune system, where the virus particle, which is not neutralized by the bound antibody, fuses with the endosomal membranes and infects the cell in an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of the infection. As reviewed recently (Rey et al., 2018) , the mechanism behind ADE appears to be related to particle heterogeneity introduced by partial maturation of the UGP as well as conformational dynamics of the fusion protein on the mature virions (illustrated in Figure 3B ).",36.289328460110625,13.769645942722448

Six of these had very high counts, ranging from 300 to more than 500, a total considered too numerous to count but estimated to be from 3,001 to more than 5,000 CFUs recovered. It should be understood, however, that the swab-rinse sampling methodology is not a precise measurement of the amount of contamination on a surface. Colony counts would depend on variables such as the swabbing technique used and the condition of the surface sampled. Colony counts also vary depending on the amount of saliva contamination on a dental care worker's gloves before he or she uses an item and the amount of digital contact he or she makes with the item.

Four serotypes of DENV exist (DENVs 1-4) and are transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. All have the potential to cause a range of clinical illness, from asymptomatic infection to classical dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Infection with one serotype (primary infection) results in immunity to that serotype, but infection can occur with any of the remaining serotypes (secondary infection) [173] . Secondary infection has been shown to be a significant risk factor for the development of severe dengue, and this appears to result from both disadvantageous humoral and cellular immune responses (termed antibody-dependent enhancement and original antigenic sin, respectively) [174, 175] .

The mechanisms resulting in hyperglycemia include (1) a reduction in insulin production, (2) an increase in gluconeogenesis, (3) a decrease in peripheral glucose utilization, and (4) reduced glycogen synthesis. These effects are thought to be dose dependent, because reduced doses of CS have been shown to decrease insulin resistance. 8 In addition, CSs enhance appetite, particularly for sweetened foods. As will be described later, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) contribute significantly to the development of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM).

However, evidence for cross reactive immune responses against different CoVs is limited to a few studies. Convalescent SARS-CoV patient sera weakly neutralized MERS-CoV [75] and SARS-S reactive antisera showed low level neutralization of MERS-CoV [61] . Extra-RBD S1 or S2 epitopes could be responsible for this effect, as some neutralizing epitopes have been identified in these regions of the S protein [58, 62] . These may not be as immunodominant as the RBD epitopes but could provide a rationale for the development of a cross protective CoV epitope-focused vaccine. A recent study also demonstrated the potential role of adaptive response against N protein in protection against MERS-CoV infection as this vaccine candidate produced a protective T-cell response against MERS-CoV challenge which was also partially protective against SARS-CoV [27 ] . Moreover, infection of mice with SARS-CoV reduced MERS-CoV titers 5 days p.i. upon challenge suggesting the development of a cross reactive T-cell response [26] . Thus, mapping and focusing the immune response towards these critical neutralizing and T-cell epitopes, which could be subdominant, may provide a way to induce immune responses with a broader activity against different CoVs. Immune focusing may also be beneficial for the generation of a robust virus-specific immune response. As during vaccine preparation, some epitopes which are normally hidden in the full length protein structure get exposed. Some epitopes could be immunodominant and have a negative contribution on the overall neutralization capacity produced by the vaccine [76 ] . This also holds true for some non-neutralizing immunodominant epitopes, as S1-based vaccines induced slightly higher neutralization than whole S ectodomain-based ones [58, 53] . Additionally, the RBD induced higher neutralizing antibodies compared to an S1 subunit vaccine [48] , and shorter regions of RBD induced even higher neutralization responses [66] , indicating that additional regions inducing non-neutralizing antibodies may contribute negatively to the overall neutralization response produced. Additionally, antibody-dependent enhancement of the viral infection by non-neutralizing antibodies [77] [78] [79] , despite not being reported so far for MERS-CoV, needs also to be taken into consideration when developing a coronavirus vaccine. One approach to enhance the efficacy of subunit vaccines is to mask those negativelycontributing epitopes through glycosylation [76 ] . Other approaches are immunefocusing and epitope-based vaccines, all aiming at narrowing the immune response to target only critical or beneficial epitopes to produce a stronger protective response. A prerequisite to reach that goal is to map epitopes targeted by the immune system and identify their biological role as being neutralizing, non-neutralizing, infection enhancing, containing a Tcell epitope, and so on. This can be achieved by analyzing the activity and fine specificity of convalescent patient sera, infected animal polyclonal sera, monoclonal antibodies, animal and human PBMCs. Subsequently the predicted epitopes can also provide a basis for potential vaccine candidates when produced as nanoparticles or VLPs. Further characterization of the immune responses induced by these vaccine candidates when evaluated in an animal model may be utilized to optimize the vaccines for efficacy (Figure 1 ). This epitope-focused vaccine approach may allow for targeting less immunodominant B-and T-cell epitopes having broader protection, avoid eliciting immune responses against epitopes playing no role in protection or having a negative or harmful role. In addition to better targeting of protective immunodominant epitopes, a combination of those epitopes, B-and Tcell epitopes targeting different viral proteins, could be used to produce a broader and stronger protective immune response for both strain-specific and universal CoV vaccines.",16.713492555577666,10.537625691399661

Nanotechnology in the field of cancer has the potential to improve the monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, provide novel methods for the detection and profiling of cancers at early stages, and allow surgeons to delineate tumor margins and sentinel lymph nodes. Nanomaterials have unique features that are attractive and can be applied to biosensing. The development of various nanomaterials and nanotechnology has enabled detection of cancer biomarkers with great precision and sensitivity that could not be achieved before. Many studies are being conducted on developing sensing mechanisms that will push down the detection limit as far down as possible (Anajwala et al., 2010) . Ligand-free nano-formulations generally possess passive targeting property with little tissue specificity. To address these limitations, research has been continued to advance active or specific targeting to enhance the efficacy of anticancer therapeutic agents, as well as to reduce the toxicity to nontargeted healthy tissues. Nanoparticles containing the chemotherapeutic agents are specifically designed to target the cancerous cells either by ligand receptor interaction or antibody-antigen recognition. Highly specific Mabs are used to strengthen the immune response and to intensify the immune system's antitumor capacity. Moreover, Mabs are highly specific when attached to nanoparticles to aid in targeted delivery of various antitumor cytotoxic agents or function themselves as effective therapeutic agents (Sutradhar and Amin, 2014) . There are different ways of destroying cancer cells with Mabs: directly by inducing apoptosis, blocking growth factor receptors or inducing the formation of antiidiotype, and indirectly by activating complement-mediated cellular cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity .",13.132313628683395,8.001439608028996

Although this retrospective study design did not permit detailed clinical data collection for reference, the secondary analysis was performed using a secondary PCR assay. However, the secondary PCR assay itself is still not perfect in diagnosing every type of respiratory virus in clinical samples. As a result, two out of four adenovirus detections, for which the Luminex assay had poor sensitivity to detect (Pabbaraju et al., 2008) , were not able to be confirmed in this study and may have underestimated the performance of RT-PCR/ESI-MS platform for adenoviruses.",14.919599616336164,5.762877823308178

Recommended vaccines are included in Table 40 .3. Hepatitis B vaccine is especially important for patients who are listed for transplantation since there is an increased risk for transmission in dialysis centers and patients who are immune may be more safely transplanted with kidneys from donors with a history of hepatitis B or those at increased risk for new hepatitis B infections. Patients with CKD should receive a double dose of the recombinant vaccine and hepatitis B surface antibody levels should be measured following completion of the vaccine series. 182 Historically, there have been some concerns regarding an increased risk for rejection after influenza vaccine due to the development of low level de novo anti-HLA antibodies after immunization. 183 However, the linkage of vaccination to rejection has not been demonstrated and a study examining Medicare claims data in the first year after kidney transplant demonstrated that influenza vaccination was associated with reduced allograft loss and death. 184 Ideally, all vaccines should be updated before transplantation; however, nonlive virus vaccines may be safely administered after transplant. 181 If possible, it may be advisable to delay posttransplant immunization for 6 months to improve vaccine response; if a patient is transplanted immediately before influenza season, vaccines may be given sooner after transplant. Because transplant recipients may have suboptimal vaccine responses, it is important to vaccinate household contacts as well. CKD and transplantation have both been associated with reduced vaccine responsiveness; these individuals should receive conjugate pneumococcal vaccine followed by the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule vaccine to maximize vaccine response. 185 Vaccine schedules are updated annually; it is important to review to ensure appropriate immunizations are administered. 186 Although kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk for infection, careful consideration of specific infection risks, implementation of preventive measures, and early recognition of infections may mitigate this risk.

Both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines require the production of large volumes of pathogens in the form of viruses and bacteria. This lengthy culturing process contributes to a considerable lag time between antigen production and vaccine delivery. Furthermore, it demands specialized containment facilities and poses considerable risk to the operators and environment due to the infectious nature of the material [6, 7] .

The concentration of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the hemagglutinin receptor of influenza viruses is a current determinant in protection against infection, particularly following receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, this is a limited assessment of protection, because: (i) NAb titers that incur full protection vary; and (ii) NAb titers do not account for the entire breadth of antibody responses against viral infection. Previous reports have indicated that antibodies that prime ADCC play a vital role in controlling influenza infections, and thus should be quantified for assessing protection against influenza. This report demonstrates a non-radioactive assay that assesses NK cell activation as a marker of ADCC, in which NK cells interact with opsonized viral antigen expressed on the surface of infected Raji target cells resulting in effector cell degranulation (surrogate CD107a expression). A positive correlation was determined between HAI titers and sustained NK cell activation, although NK cell activation was seen in plasma samples with HAI titers below 40 and varied amongst samples with high HAI titers. Furthermore, sustained NK cell degranulation was determined for influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin, indicating the potential utility of this therapy for influenza treatment. We conclude that this assay is reproducible and relevant.",14.854654213739844,10.290227462186111

Live viral vectored vaccines may be based on replication-defective as well as replication-competent viruses. As some live recombinant vectored vaccine may replicate, one key challenge is defining the length of time for monitoring AEFI after administration of vectored vaccines in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. This time period must be chosen with care and based on considerations of clinical trial data and biological plausibility. A long duration of monitoring is often challenging in countries with poor health infrastructure, in countries with evolving AEFI monitoring systems with multiple priorities and even in countries with excellent infrastructure which are challenged with new diseases and new vaccines [36, 40] . Some of the available options for defining the length of follow-up to be used in studies of new viral vector vaccine candidates include adapting from current relevant regulatory guidelines; convening a panel of experts to review the evidence from a systematic literature search to narrow down a list of likely or known AEFI and optimal biologically plausible risk window(s); conducting ''near-real-time'' prospective monitoring for unknown clustering's of AEFI in validated large linked vaccine safety databases (e.g., Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), PRISM, etc.). This includes Rapid Cycle Analysis (RCA) for prespecified AESI and TreeScan for previously unsuspected outcomes. The risk interval established by one of the above-mentioned methods can be used along with establishing a registry of cases identified with clinically validated pre-specified AESI to include in casecontrol studies. The available infrastructure, human and financial resources, coded databases in countries and regulatory guidelines will determine which (one or a combination) of these methods would be practically feasible. These options might be broadly applicable to the duration of surveillance for other new pharmaceutical products. The risk intervals selected for clinical trials or epidemiologic studies may not be of the appropriate length to rule out associations in individual cases. Since our knowledge of the pathophysiology of many AEFI is incomplete; a longer risk interval may be required when evaluating an AEFI in an individual. Rare individuals may have genetic immune defects that result in increased susceptibility to vaccine viruses. Mortality rates in vaccine recipients with such defects may be high. However, because of their rarity, they are likely to be discovered only in postmarketing analyses [63] .",15.153397689375577,10.123007724225177

The antibody titer is expressed as the highest serum dilution that neutralizes the test dose of virus. As a bioassay, neutralization assays are highly specific and quite sensitive. For many viral agents, the neutralizing antibody level is directly correlated with immunity, an important clinical and epidemiologic endpoint. Disadvantages of the assay include the time required to obtain a result and the relatively high cost, due to the labor intensity and requirement for cell culture and titered viral stocks. Neutralization assays may be carried out in a variety of systems and the endpoint measured by a number of different procedures. Different neutralization systems include plaque reduction neutralization, sometimes using complement enhancement, where the number of virus plaques in control wells are compared with the number seen in cultures inoculated with the virus-serum mixture; microneutralization, an assay performed in microtiter plates requiring small amounts of sera; and colorimetric assays. Colorimetric assays rely on markers indicating metabolic inhibition of the virus in cell cultures or on antigen-antibody reactions with antibody tagged or reacted with enzyme-linked antibodies. Colorimetric assays are generally analyzed by measurement of optical density and have the advantage of being less time-consuming and costly to set up and analyze than other assays. Colorimetric assays often are more sensitive than assays relying on inhibition of CPE [60] . The type of assay used to assess antibody is very important, particularly in the evaluation of susceptibility to vaccine-preventable or epidemic viruses such as measles or rubella, where low levels of antibody may be predictive of protection. Direct comparison of various laboratory methods used for the detection of virus-specific antibody may be important in designing studies or evaluating study results. For example, analysis of CMV antibody using neutralization by plaque reduction has shown poor correlation with CMV antibody using EIA [61] . Different neutralization methods also may give differing results, as has been shown in the analysis of antibody to RSV, where microneutralization assays appear to be more indicative of biological protection than either direct or competitive ELISA methods or complement-enhanced plaque reduction [62] .",16.901827810011586,8.475878935288188

Mutations in S gene have previously been correlated with altered pathogenesis, virulence and tropism in other coronaviruses [7] . The S proteins of some coronaviruses are cleaved by a host cell trypsin-like protease into S1 involved in receptor binding and S2 involved in cell fusion. The S proteins are the major targets of the neutralizing antibodies in some animal coronaviruses and can also induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes. For example, the S proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) could elicit neutralizing antibodies which protect animals from virulent virus challenge. In addition, the immune protection of S1 subunit at N-terminus of S protein is more potent than that of S2 subunit at C-terminus [8, 9] . However, it is not the case in feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV), in which the antibodies against the S protein of FIPV are not protective. It has been found that the antibodies against FIPV S protein enhance the disease progression, this is the same as the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection effects of Dengue Virus, in which virus-antibody immune complexes bind to monocytes or macroph-ages via Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G or complement receptors on the cell surface [10] .

FIPV, however, is unique among coronaviruses in that it causes an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon (Weiss and Scott, 19811 , which is the result of the binding of the virus-antibody complex to Fc receptors on the surface of macrophages, leading to enhanced virus uptake and spread. This ADE phenomenon has been attributed to the S protein-antibody complex (Vennema et al., 1990b; Corapi et al., 1992; Olsen et al., 1992) . The Fc receptor may be a co-factor or an alternative receptor for FIPV entry into macrophages.

However, shortly after the introduction of OPV, sporadic cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio were reported at a level of one per 750,000 recipients [12] . In rare situations, the few attenuating mutations that are present in one vaccine strain could potentially cause the live OPV to revert to virulence. Nevertheless, the OPV vaccine has continued to be used worldwide and could be responsible for eradicating polio infection in the next few years. However, as the level of polio falls, OPV is gradually being replaced with an alternative killed, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which cannot cause polio even in the most susceptible individuals. An important lesson is that future live vaccines will not be acceptable unless there is a clear understanding of their molecular attenuation and the potential for reversion to virulence has been eliminated, either as a result of the size or the number of attenuating deletions.

The clarification of cellular immune responses to TGEV is important because CMI may play a direct role in protection and recovery from infection and the production of antibodies is regulated by various cytokines derived from activated MNC during an immune response. Antigen-specific CMI mechanisms that have been described in pigs infected with TGEV include antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), T-lymphocyte cytotoxicity, and lymphocyte proliferation. Antibodies participate in CMI through ADCC in which specific antibody acts in cooperation with macrophages, neutrophils or lymphocytes to directly kill antibody-coated virus-infected cells. ADCC against TGEV-infected targets has been reported in swine (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984a) . Another mechanism of specific antiviral immunity is major histocompatibility antigen-restricted killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes of infected target cells that express viral antigens on their surface. A study on the cytotoxic T cell response to TGEV in 2-3 month old pigs showed that oral priming of enteric mucosa will stimulate virus-specific T-lymphocyte cytotoxicity at the sites examined (Peyer's patches, MLN, spleen and peripheral blood) (Shimizu and Shimizu, 1979a) , although the role of these cells in recovery from TGE in young pigs has not been elucidated.",13.356946745213692,9.922279359443872

The difference in antibody response was not only quantitative but also qualitative. Antibody affinity after nanoparticle vaccination to native GP was 4-fold higher compared with the DNA vaccine-induced antibodies. However, this trend was specific for affinity to the native GP, because the antibody affinity to the denatured form of GP was higher for DNA vaccine-induced IgG compared with the nanoparticle protein-based vaccine. These findings may suggest differences in processing of the native intact GP nanoparticle and DNA-encoded GP expression in host cells after immunization by the TcB immune system. The level of GP expression/secretion in vivo, after plasmid DNA vaccination, cannot be easily determined. Furthermore, the 2 vaccine platforms may also differ in the levels of CD4 + T helper cells and T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells induced. The Tfh play an important role in antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers. In BALB/c mice challenge studies with mouse-adapted (ma) EBOV strain, 7 of 10 mice treated with the 100 mg/kg SAB-132 (V3) IgG and 9 of 10 mice treated with 100 mg/kg SAB-139 (V2) IgG intraperitoneally 1 day postchallenge survived the lethal EBOV infection [9, 10] . The greater antibody epitope diversity and antibody affinities observed for the SAB-139 (rGP vaccine) compared with SAB-132 (DNA vaccine) may explain the better in vitro neutralization as well as in vivo protective efficacy observed for the SAB-139 IgG preparation in the previous mice challenge studies [9, 10] .",14.933996294148622,9.534317502352348

However, since it was not different from the other vaccinated groups it is reasonable to claim that protection was achieved. The oocyst count scores and the microscopic lesion scores of the vaccinated groups were all statistically the same as the mean score of the positive challenge control group. However, interpretation of these scores is difficult, considering that the birds were all kept on litter during the 7 days postchallenge, and could have continued to cycle vaccine oocysts during this time, rendering it nearly impossible to distinguish between vaccine and challenge oocysts present in the mid-intestine. Although the positive challenge control group did not differ significantly in oocyst count and microscopic lesion scores from the vaccinated/challenged groups, it is possible that the E. maxima scored for the positive control assays was present from challenge, whereas the E. maxima seen in the vaccinated/challenge groups may have been from vaccine.

In previous studies, SPR using His 6 -tag captured protein on HTG chips with a panel of conformation-dependent GP-specific neutralizing MAbs confirmed conservation of native GP structure. However, these MAbs lost binding to rGP that was amine-coupled directly to GLC chips, suggesting partial denaturation of the GP and loss of conformational epitopes [11] . The negative control-purified TcB IgG showed very low reactivity (<5 RU at 1 mg/mL total IgG concentration) to rGPs in SPR.

The interests of the public are protected by regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration whose role is to approve vaccines only if the proven benefits outweigh any measurable risks [147] . Assessment of vaccine risk-benefit is more complex than for therapeutic interventions, as benefits of vaccination can accrue to the population through herd immunity, while the risks of any adverse reactions are suffered by individuals, potentially raising complex ethical issues [148] . Hence, perceptions of risk-benefit at the individual level, i.e. ""I do not want immunization because any benefits do not justify the risk of a vaccine reaction"" [149] , can sometimes be difficult to reconcile with risk-benefit assessments at the public health level, i.e. ""if we allow too many individuals not to be immunized, herd immunity will be lost and serious infectious disease outbreaks may eventuate"" [150] . Hence, policy makers and vaccine recipients might have very different perceptions of immunization risk-benefits [151] . This is also likely to shape the publics' view of adjuvant risk-benefits, particularly in situations where both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines are available for the same indication. For example, an approved seasonal influenza vaccine in Europe contains MF59 squalene emulsion adjuvant, but the vast majority of influenza vaccines used in Europe are not adjuvanted [152] . Factors influencing consumer and practitioner utilization of adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted influenza vaccines could thereby be a useful area of study. No adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines are currently available in the US, which could potentially reflect differences in regulatory and consumer views across continents [141] . During the 2009 influenza pandemic both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted pandemic vaccines were utilized in Europe, with consumers not always given a choice regarding which vaccine was used [153] . By contrast, only unadjuvanted pandemic vaccines were used in the US [154] . This imposed lack of consumer choice in some European countries may have acted to reinforce negative perceptions of adjuvanted vaccines, particularly when it was subsequently revealed that a squalene-adjuvanted vaccine used during the pandemic was associated with an increased risk of childhood narcolepsy [8] . Given potential public apprehension around the term 'adjuvant', there is a need for more research to identify the source of such fears and develop strategies to alleviate them [155] . The origins of consumer apprehension surrounding adjuvants is likely to be multifactorial, with potential contributors being general mistrust in governments and public health policy, perceptions of lack of choice, media coverage of rare adverse reactions, confusion between issues of aluminum, thiomersal and other vaccine excipients, and citing of papers on the role of adjuvants such as oil emulsions in autoimmune disease in animal models. In respect of the latter, scientists know animal model findings may not always translate to humans, as reflected in the saying 'mice lie'. However, in the absence of adequate education many consumers are unlikely to appreciate this point and may place undue emphasis on such data when making risk-benefit assessments in respect of adjuvanted vaccines. It is also important that more research is undertaken to better understand such adverse effects in animal models and how they relate to the human context.",14.396515508305459,9.363948334191242

Although there exist some disadvantages of this method, e.g. that the number of antibodies is limited compared to the numerous intracellular proteins, and that the specificity of antibody is required but not always guaranteed [18] , CO-IP-MS is still commonly used in proteomic research as an increasing number of related papers have been published. In one study, Noisakran et al. employed coimmunoprecipitation, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and quadruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry to study the functions of NS1 protein in dengue and its interacting partners in the infected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). MS analysis successfully identified eight isoforms of NS1 and human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C1/C2, which were co-purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody. This association between NS1 and hnRNP C1/C2 was suggested to have implications on cellular responses in favor of virus replications [19] . Also, Watanabe et al. utilized immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF-MS to analyze the influenza virus M1 protein and its interacting partners.

Methods: The cultures of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) BJ-01 strain infected Vero cells were inactivated with ␤-propiolactone. Sequential procedures, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, were performed to obtain purified inactivated SARS vaccine. The purified SARS vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope, HPLC and Western blotting. We immunized three groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis with adjuvant-containing purified vaccine, purified vaccine and unpurified vaccine, respectively, and a fourth group served as a control. Antibody titers were measured by plaque reduction neutralization test. The vaccinated monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV BJ-01 strain to observe protective efficacy. Additionally, three groups of rhesus monkeys were immunized with different doses of the purified inactivated SARS vaccine (0.5, 1 and 2 g/time/monkey) on days 0 and 7, and the monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV GZ-01 strain. We assessed the safety of the SARS vaccine and observed whether the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) occurred under low levels of neutralizing antibody in rhesus. Findings: The purity of SARS vaccine was 97.6% by HPLC identification and reacted with convalescent sera of SARS patients. The purified SARS vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and prevented the replication of SARS-CoV in monkeys. Under low levels of neutralizing antibody, no exacerbation of clinical symptoms was observed when the immunized monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV. In this preliminary animal trial, no side effects were detected when monkeys were immunized with purified SARS vaccine either at normal or large doses.

Several studies showed that a similar extent of T-cell cross-reactivity exists between ZIKV and other flavivirus owing to their high amino acid identity; 55.15% for DENV, 46.13% for yellow fever virus (YFV), 56.83 % for West Nile virus (WNV), and 55.92% for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) ( Table 1 ). The potential cross-reactivity between ZIKV and DENV was also indicated by our structure analysis of virus-derived peptides complexed to HLA I molecules ( Figure 2C and D) . Wen et al. identified that ZIKV/DENV cross-reactive epitopes elicited CD8 + T-cell responses that reduced infectious ZIKV levels as well as altered the immunodominance pattern in the DENVimmune setting relative to the naive type (Table 1) (Wen et al., 2017b) . Similarly, virus-specific CD8 + T-cells induced by previous DENV infection can predominantly mediate crossprotective responses to ZIKV in mice (Wen et al., 2017a) . A recent study showed that ZIKV NS1-and E-reactive memory CD4 + T-cells had a low cross-reactivity with DENV (Table  1 ) (Stettler et al., 2016) . However, in humoral immunity, it has been shown that DENV antibodies are cross-reactive to ZIKV and can enhance ZIKV infection mediated by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (Bardina et al., 2017) . Although many studies have explored cross-reactivity between DENV and ZIKV in humoral and cellular immunity, the dual role of cross-reactive T-cells to flaviviruses in protection and pathogenesis remains unknown. Cross-reactive T-cells in ZIKV may also lead to the failure of an appropriate immune response to the other flavivirus serotypes, as ""original antigenic sin"" occurred between flavivirus and crossreactive T-cells. Mongkolsapaya et al. have discussed ""original antigenic sin"" in the context of the suboptimal degranulation of cross-reactive dengue-specific T-cells, besides the high cytokine storm in DENV infection (Mongkolsapaya et al., 2006) . Thus, more researchers should focus on vaccine development for ZIKV, especially for application in recipients previously infected by other flaviviruses, such as DENV (Halstead, 2007; Mongkolsapaya et al., 2003) . There is an urgency in determining the mechanism for ""original Tcell antigenic sin"" in flaviviruses, which might benefit future efficacious vaccine formulations and antiviral therapy.",28.313894506801486,13.542526327350002

In addition, DHF in infants has been associated with waning levels of maternal antibodies [33] [34] [35] . The most widely accepted hypothesis for the pathogenesis of DHF in these settings is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which anti-DENV IgG, either actively or passively acquired, enhances DENV infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells, resulting in an increased infected cell mass and triggering an immunological wave [34] . In addition, there is evidence in secondary infections that dengue-specific memory T cells may be reactivated by the heterologous serotype dengue infection. Expanding to high levels, T-cell effector mechanisms, including cytokine production and lysis of infected cells, could result in direct and indirect effects causing increased vascular permeability [36] .

These IgG 2a MAbs enhanced the infection even when macrophages pretreated with the MAb were washed and then inoculated with the virus. Immunofluorescence flow cytometric analysis of the macrophages treated with each of the MAbs showed that the IgG 2a MAbs but not the IgG 1 MAbs bound to feline alveolar macrophages. Treatment of the IgG 2a MAb with protein A decreased the binding to the macrophages and, in parallel, diminished the ADE activity. Although no infection was observed by inoculation of FIPV to human monocyte cell line U937 cells, FIPV complexed with either the IgG 2a MAb or the IgG 1 MAb caused infection in U937 cells which are shown to express Fc gamma receptor (Fc 7 R) I and II that can bind mouse IgG 2a and IgG 1, respectively.

Enhancement of viral infectivity has been mostly studied in vitro with cells susceptible to virus infections and bearing Fc and/or complement receptors. Antibody-coated virus can infect cells via FcR rather than via a specific receptor. Many non-or low-cytopathic viruses are suspected to use such antibody enhancement for infection, including HIV (Takeda et al., 1988; Robinson et al., 1988; Homsy et al., 1989) , Dengue viruses (Halstead, 1988) , and perhaps HCV. The first observations made with flaviviruses by Hawkes et al. (Hawkes, 1964) were largely extended by Halstead and coworkers (Halstead, 1988) . They describe an antibody-dependant enhancement of Dengue virus replication of about 100-fold in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes of humans or primates. To what extent serotype differences contribute to viral infection via FcR and whether or not antibody-dependent enhancement plays a major role in vivo is, however, still not very clear for viruses other than Dengue. However, low-avidity antibodies may enhance early uptake of a new serotype and therefore render a second infection in some immune patients more pathogenic than the first infection (Burke et al., 1988; Morens, 1994; Thein et al., 1997) . This is the classical explanation for severe hemorrhagic disease after repetitive Dengue virus infections, but similar mechanisms may apply to persisting viruses that escape nAbs. It may also explain the early death of kittens inoculated with infectious feline peritonitis virus following passive transfer of antiviral antibodies (Weiss and Scott, 1981) . In addition, arenavirus infections including LCMV have shown enhancement in vitro and likely also in vivo (Lewis et al., 1988; Ochsenbein et al., 1999a) .",24.745228822248038,10.919158821380039

The standard inactivated vaccine is composed of two influenza A and one influenza B strain. Vaccine composition varies annually based on predicted antigenic drifts and shifts in circulating virus; consequently, annual reimmunization is recommended for optimal protection. Live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine is not recommended for immunosuppressed hosts, including transplant recipients, or for family or health care providers who are in close contact with the patients. Numerous studies over several decades have examined vaccine responses in transplant recipients and have demonstrated conflicting results. In general, both humoral and cellular vaccine responses seem to be suboptimal when compared with healthy controls and cannot be reliably predicted based on the level of immunosuppression [70 -73] . Anecdotal reports have suggested a potential linkage between vaccination and organ rejection; however, this association has not been supported by the majority of studies examining the immunogenicity of vaccine in SOT recipients.

Different viral proteins from selected rotaviral genotypes were found to bind to either i epitopes or their type 1 isomers with or without internal Le x of human milk oligosaccharides in a strainand viral protein-dependent manner [64] . Consequently, infectivity seems to be highly dependent on the virus genotype in interaction with the host ancestry/ethnicity and different histo-BGs.

Interestingly, anti-histo-BG, but not immunoglobulin G or total antibody titers prior to the challenge with norovirus were positively correlated with protection against infection in placebo-recipients, while in vaccinees the frequency of severe disease was lower with higher pre-challenge anti-histo-BG antibody titers [111] .

The priming effect of a previous viral infection can induce cross-reactive but nonneutralizing antibody, as well as neutralizing antibody to SARS. Furthermore, the nonneutralizing antibodies are known to facilitate viral infection, termed antibodydependent enhancement (ADE), which is the pathogenic basis of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV, a type II coronavirus), dengue hemorrhagic fever, and other viruses (34) (35) (36) 37) . In the case of FIPV, ADE can occur even with neutralizing antibody (38) . However, this type of ADE resulted directly from neutralizing antibody is unlikely to occur with SARS-CoV infection because a number of SARS patients have been treated with convalescent-phase serum of SARS patients and show no adverse effect (33) . The hypothesis that the early responders may have experienced a priming effect could be verified by demonstrating that a significantly higher proportion of early responders than other SARS patients possess antibody against non-SARS coronavirus during the acute phase. Early death occurring within the first 2 weeks of illness is also associated with high nasopharyngeal virus load among a subset of SARS patients with information on nasopharyngeal virus load (J.-Y. Yang et al., unpub. data). Unfortunately, the number of early responders for whom information on virus load was available was too few to yield a meaningful statistical analysis on whether high virus load is correlated with an early humoral response. While antibody induced by a variety of SARS-CoV antigen preparations protects against SARS-CoV infection in mice and ferrets (39, 40) , these animals do not develop clinical symptoms resembling that of SARS-CoV infection in humans and thus are not models of pathogenesis.

These structures show that the bumpy form of DENV2 is able to bind an anti-DENV Fab 1A1D-2 (Lok et al., 2008) and E104 (Zhang et al., 2015) only at elevated temperatures. The cryo-EM structure of Fab 1A1D-DENV2 complex demonstrates that the complex formation was temperature dependent with a higher level of Fab binding at 37°C than at ambient temperature due to the exposure of a hidden part of the Fab binding epitope on the E proteins (Lok et al., 2008) . However, it has also been shown that this temperaturedependent transition from smooth to bumpy is strain-dependent. The cryo-EM structure of the DENV4 virion at 4.1-Å resolution suggests that this serotype has higher thermal stability than other DENV strains . Furthermore, unlike other DENV strains, these virions do not expose the fusion loops to allow binding to flavivirus mAbs until the temperature is increased to 40°C (Sukupolvi-Petty et al., 2013) . A DENV2-specific human mAb (2D22) complex cryo-EM structure suggests that HMAb 2D22 neutralizes DENV2 by binding E dimers and prevents the E protein rearrangement required for viral entry (Fibriansah et al., 2015a) . The cryo-EM structure of Fab HMAb 5J7-DENV3 complex shows that a single Fab molecule of HMAb 5J7 simultaneously binds to three functionally significant E protein domains, each on a different E protein molecule, to prevent virus attachment (Fibriansah et al., 2015b) . The cryo-EM structure of a DENV1-HMAb 1F4 complex has revealed that the HMAb 1F4 binds to DI and DI-DII hinge region on an E protein monomer to prevent different stages of viral entry (Fibriansah et al., 2014) while the DENV1 specific HM14c10 targets an adjacent surface of E protein dimers to neutralize the virus by blocking virus attachment as shown by cryo-EM of the DENV1-HMAb 14c10 complex (Teoh et al., 2012) . More recently, cryo-EM has been applied to study two highly neutralizing antibodies (2C8 and 3H5) against DENV E protein and to understand the difference in their capacity to promote antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) (Renner et al., 2018; Wirawan et al., 2019) . It was proposed that antibody 3H5 promoted minimal ADE by its unusual binding to the viral surface resulting in poor access to the Fc region. Another study looked at the role of anti-prM antibodies in the pathogenesis of immature DENV by the cryo-EM structures of the immature DENV in complex with a Fab fragment of HMAb 1H10, at different pH values. This suggested the mechanism by which the Fab 1H10 enhanced attachment of immature DENV to liposomes by increasing dissociation of prM from E (Wirawan et al., 2019) .",26.612442811988966,14.29749899330945

Other than by neutralization assay, these viruses serologically cross-react and encode crossreactive T-cell epitopes. The most severe manifestation of dengue disease is dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, and this most commonly presents when individuals immune to one strain (serotype) of dengue virus become infected with another strain. This has long been thought due to cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibody that binds to viruses without inactivating them and instead enhances the infection of cells like macrophages that bear Fc receptors, in a process known as immune enhancement (124) . However, this may be only part of the mechanism, as extensive T-cell cross-reactivity occurs between these viruses (125) ( Table 1 ). One report shows that a substantial part of the T-cell response to the second dengue virus infection consisted of CD8 + T cells having higher affinity to the previously encountered dengue virus than to the one causing the current infection (49) . Thus, a combination of enhanced viral load due to antibody-dependent immune enhancement plus cross-reactive low affinity T-cell responses may help contribute to the severity of the disease.",19.490007516568134,11.30560013541463

Early neutralizing antibody responders are more likely to be older, to have a higher case-fatality rate, and to survive for a shorter time.

The pH1HA DNA vaccine induced high-level HA-specific antibody responses in Aim2 +/+ mice, but significantly lower antibody titers in Aim2 −/− mice ( Figure 3A ). This reduction is isotype-dependent as Aim2 −/− mice exhibited significantly lower levels of HA-specific IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2c responses (data not shown). Likewise, Aim2 −/− mice exhibited significantly reduced HA-specific circulating B cells as well as IFN-γ secreting CD8 + T cells in the spleen ( Figure 3C,D) . The role of Aim2 in regulating the maturation process of pH1HA-induced antibody responses was further confirmed by measuring the avidity of serum HA-specific antibodies in these mice ( Figure 3B ). Aim2 +/+ mice required high concentrations of the chaotropic agent NaSCN to disrupt antigen/antibody complexes, while much lower concentrations of NaSCN were required for disassociation in Aim2 −/− mice.

It was well documented that neutralizing antibody induced by the spike protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV, also a coronavirus) failed to protect cats from the virus challenge [12] . On the contrary, antibodies acquired either through a passive transfer of immune serum against the spike protein of FIPV [13] or by immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the spike protein [14] often lead to accelerated infection by the mechanism of ADE of the virus infectivity. More recently, the enhanced susceptibility to FIPV has also been linked to the immune responses induced by the virus membrane and nucleocapsid protein co-delivered with interleukin-12 [15] . SARS-CoV has been shown to infect hepatocytes and cause hepatitis in humans [16] . Therefore, our observation that immunization with rMVA-S induced enhanced hepatitis in ferrets after SARS-CoV challenge is in line with the previous reports on ADE of FIPV infection. A failure to observe detectable immune response induced by rMVA-N and an inconsistent link between the rMVA-N vaccination and enhanced liver inflammation may be due to the lack of optimization of the immunization regimen in this experiment. Further investigation to improve the immune responses by the use of different immunization regimen, more ferrets (which would allow a post mortem examination at various time points after vaccination and challenge), more detailed analysis of the immune responses and immunohistological studies should aid in understanding the link between the immune responses induced by SARS-CoV antigens and the enhanced liver inflammation.

A derivative of the S protein with a truncation at amino acid (aa) 1153 fails to cause antibody dependent enhancement of infection, but retains the ability to induce neutralizing antibodies. These findings suggest that the elimination of the putative heptad repeated 2 (HR2, aa 1153-1194), which is implicated in viral fusion, might abrogate the stimulation of virus infection-enhancing antibodies [47, 48] . The use of the nucleoprotein of the coronavirus in a DNA vaccination protocol also led to the stimulation of a protective response [49] .

A genetic predisposition has been suggested, with higher disease incidence in certain lines. 15, 43 Considerable controversy surrounds the ability of the currently available FIP vaccine (Primucell-FIP; Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA) to prevent disease. Some studies demonstrate protection from disease I9 ,24; others show little benefit from vaccination. 36 ,51 Antibody-dependent enhancement of disease in vaccinates has been demonstrated in experimental challenge exposUJ'e studies,50 but it is uncertain whether antibody-dependent enhancement occurs in a natural setting. Discrepancies between study results are probably attributable to differences in test methodology (e.g., strain and dose of challenge virus, genetic predisposition of the test animals). Protection from disease has not been demonstrated in animals vaccinated when younger than 16 weeks of age. Most kittens born and reared in environments in which FCo V infection is endemic are infected before reaching this age. l , 22 In these instances, vaccination of infected cats has not proven beneficial. At this time, there is no evidence that the vaccine induces clinically relevant protection, and its use is not recommended. canis infection is not recommended. At the time of this writing, the product has not been independently evaluated for efficacy. Based on studies conducted by the manufacturer, it is reasonable to consider vaccination as adjunctive treatment for individual infected cats 4 months of age or older to hasten resolution of clinical signs. If the vaccine induces an immune response that accelerates lesion resolution, the number of infectious fungal spores produced by vaccinates may be reduced as well; thus, it is reasonable to consider vaccination as one component of a comprehensive treatment program in multiple-cat environments in which M. canis infection is endemic. Nonetheless, the ability of this product to hasten elimination of endemic infections from such environments has not been evaluated. The revaccination interval is not stipulated on the label. Major adverse events reportedly associated with the use of this product are pain, temporary hair loss, and formation of sterile abscesses or granulomas at the vaccine site. 38",23.58472961084083,12.412184860940897

The FIPV-specific antibodies used are able to bind complement since virus-neutralization was higher in the presence of complement. This higher neutralization can be due to virolysis, agglutination of virus-antibody-complement complexes or coating of the virus with complement components which can interfere with the binding of the virus to target cells or alter the surface charge of the virus (Hirsch, 1982; Lachmann and Davies, 1997) . For example, it could be possible that binding of complement to the Fc portion of the antibody inhibits antibody-dependent enhancement of infectivity (ADEI), a mechanism which is described in vitro (Hohdatsu et al., 1991) . The fact that neutralizing antibodies are present in a cat with FIP, together with the observed enhancement of neutralization by complement in this study, indicates that cell free virus does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) .",25.99981427431046,11.614311451554086

In the present study, we synthesized eighty-one kinds of peptides derived from the spike (S)2 domain of type I FIPV KU-2 strain, the S2 domain of type II FIPV 79-1146 strain, and the nucleocapcid (N) protein of FIPV KU-2 strain. To detect the T helper (Th)1 epitope, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from FIPV-infected cats were cultured with each peptide, and Th1-type immune responses were measured using feline interferon (fIFN)-␥ production as an index. To detect the linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope, we investigated the reactivity of plasma collected from FIPV-infected cats against each peptide by ELISA. Four and 2 peptides containing Th1 epitopes were identified in the heptad repeat (HR)1 and inter-helical (IH) regions of the S2 domain of type I FIPV, respectively, and these were located on the N-terminal side of the regions. In the S2 domain of type II FIPV, 2, 3, and 2 peptides containing Th1 epitopes were identified in the HR1, IH, and HR2 regions, respectively, and these were mainly located on the C-terminal side of the regions. In the S2 domain of type I FIPV, 3 and 7 peptides containing linear immunodominant antibodybinding epitopes were identified in the IH and HR2 regions, respectively.

As with RSV, live attenuated vaccine candidates were developed by serial tissue culture passage of wt virus at suboptimal temperatures. One of these candidate vaccines, HPIV3cp45, was cold-passaged (cp) 45 times and acquired a set of 15 mutations that conferred the cold adaptation (ca), temperature sensitivity (ts), and attenuation (att) phenotypes. 99 HPIV3cp45 was evaluated in a phase 1 trial in infants as young as 1 month of age and was found to be appropriately attenuated and immunogenic in this target population. 51 Infants received two doses of vaccine either 1 or 3 months apart. The first dose of vaccine infected 94% of the infants, and vaccine virus was shed in low titer for 17 days (mean). Replication of the second dose of vaccine was restricted, indicating that immunization of young infants with HPIV3cp45 resulted in the induction of some protective immunity. Nonetheless, two or three doses of vaccine will likely be needed to induce durable immunity. Serum IgG antibody responses to PIV3 were only observed in a minority of young infants, possibly due to the presence of maternal PIV3specific IgG, and serum IgA antibody directed against the PIV3 HN glycoprotein seemed the most sensitive correlate of immunity. 51 In a phase 2 trial in 380 children 6 to 18 months of age, including 226 infants and children seronegative for PIV-3, the HPIV-3cp45 vaccine was well tolerated, and no difference was observed in the frequency of URI, cough, fever or otitis media between vaccine and placebo recipients. Eighty-four percent of seronegative vaccine recipients developed a fourfold or greater increase in antibody titer, indicating satisfactory infectivity and immunogenicity. 100 In addition, intranasal vaccination with a single bivalent dose (10 5 PFU per virus) of RSVcpts248/404 and HPIV3cp45 was evaluated in 6-to 18-month-old seronegative children. Although a slight reduction in HPIV3cp45 infectivity was observed with the combined vaccine (76% vs 92% in the monovalent vaccine), the combined vaccine was immunogenic, and antibody responses were comparable to the monovalent groups. 101 Following the foregoing trials, the vaccine virus was re-derived from cDNA and referred to as recombinant (r)HPIV3cp45, to further reduce the risk of potential biological contamination of the vaccine seed virus. In addition, this technology also permits rederivation of vaccine seed virus from cDNA at any time. Clinical development of rHPIV3cp45 is conducted in a cooperative research and development agreement between NIAID and MedImmune, LLC. Currently, two phase 1 trials are being sponsored by NIAID. The first protocol enrolled a total of 45 children 6 to 36 months of age into two cohorts, both randomized 2:1 to receive two doses of rHPIV3cp45 (10 5 TCID 50 ) or placebo 4 to 10 weeks apart ( Table 2 , NCT00308412). In the first cohort of 24 unscreened infants 6 to 12 months of age, frequent nasal washes were performed for quantitative virology. In this unscreened cohort, all 10 seronegative vaccinees had vaccine virus detected in nasal washes for approximately 2 weeks, with a mean peak titer of 10 3.6 TCID 50 /mL, whereas only two out of five seropositive vaccinees had vaccine virus detected for a single day each, with a mean peak titer of 10 0.9 TCID 50 /mL. Only one of the 15 vaccinees shed vaccine following the second dose, again suggesting that a protective immune response restricted replication of the vaccine virus. An additional 21 seronegative children 6 to 36 months of age were enrolled to expand safety and immunogenicity data, and the findings from the first cohort with regard to safety, infectivity and immunogenicity were confirmed. Although rHPIV3cp45 was found to be safe, well tolerated, immunogenic, and indistinguishable in this regard from biologically derived HPIV3cp45, the dosing interval of 1 to 2 months was clearly insufficient to permit reinfection and boosting of the immune response. Two additional studies in seronegative children 6 to 36 months of age were initiated to evaluate two doses of vaccine given 6 months apart (Table 2 , NCT01021397 and NCT01254175). MedImmune has initiated a trial evaluating three doses of rHPIV3cp45 given 2 months apart, and this regimen was immunogenic and well tolerated ( Table 2 , NCT01150799). 102 A second approach to developing an HPIV3 vaccine is the use of host range mutants. Bovine PIV3 (BPIV3) is a virus of cattle that is antigenically related to human PIV3 (HPIV3) but restricted in replication in nonhuman primates. 103 BPIV3 was tested in a phase 1 study in infants and children and proved to be infectious, well tolerated, and immunogenic. However, because of antigenic differences between BPIV3 and HPIV3 glycoproteins, antibody titers were lower against HPIV3 than against BPIV3. 104 A four-dose regimen of BPIV3 was evaluated in a phase 2 trial in 192 infants (2 months old) receiving 10 5 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ), 10 6 TCID 50 , or placebo at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. 105 Either dose was well tolerated, and adverse events occurred at similar frequency in vaccine and placebo recipients, with the exception of fever >38°C after the second dose, which was more common in vaccine recipients. As observed in the phase 1 study already mentioned, seroconversion rates were satisfactory against BPIV3 but only modest against HPIV3. 105 A chimeric recombinant bovine/human PIV3 virus (B/HPIV3), bearing the HPIV3 HN and F genes (encoding the glycoproteins that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies) in place of the BPIV3 genes, was found to be more immunogenic against HPIV3 in rhesus monkeys than the unmodified BPIV3 while retaining the attenuation phenotype of BPIV3. 106 This candidate vaccine was recently evaluated in healthy adults, as well as in seropositive and seronegative children ( Table 2 , NCT00366782). In adults and seropositive children, B/HPIV3 infected a minority of subjects and was poorly immunogenic, as expected. In seronegative children, the vaccine virus was highly infectious at a dose of 10 5 TCID 50 , and more than 90% of the vaccine recipients developed a fourfold or greater rise in HPIV3 HAI (hemagglutination-inhibiting) antibody titers. The mean peak titer of vaccine virus shed was 3.1 log 10 TCID 50 , similar to the mean peak titers we observed for HPIV3cp45 in seronegative children. Although URI and fever were fairly frequent during the 4-week follow-up, rates were similar in vaccinees and in placebo recipients (unpublished results).",20.503229402627692,11.794100423747452

HISTORY Feline infectious peritonitis was first described as a disease entity in the 1960s (Holzworth, 1963; Wolfe and Griesemer, 1966) . The etiology of this disease was uncertain until 1970, when virus particles were described from 12 of 25 cats with FIP (Ward, 1970) . This early paper by Ward is notable because it outlined several salient features regarding the viral etiology of FIP which have been confirmed by more recent studies. These include the tropism of the virus for macrophages, the presence of virions in vesicles and cysternae of the Golgi body, the lack of plasma membrane budding by the virus, and the presence of club-like projections from the surface of the virions. Ward and colleagues (Ward, 1970; Ward et al., 1974) suggested that the virus responsible for FIP might be a member of the Coronaviridae. Evidence for this characterization included structural similarities between mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and the putative FIPV, disease similarities between FIP and MHVrelated disease, and the possible association of a coronavirus with a retrovirus (feline leukemia virus (FeLV)/FIPV and murine leukemia virus/MHV, respectively) in the etiology of both diseases.",24.803385111418397,10.343657811934213

Among chemical methods used, formaldehyde and organic compounds such as cyclic esters (β-propiolactone) or binary ethylenimine (BEI) have been most widely used. Other cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde can be an option for the inactivation but its use has not been as wide as formaldehyde. Two main caveats of the use of cross-linking agents for vaccine preparation can be cited; the fi rst one is the potential for aggregation leading to disruption or modifi cation of antigenic epitopes possibly accounting for the reduced immunogenicity of these vaccines, usually requiring two or three booster doses to maintain adequate and lasting levels of protective immunity. Another problem is the risk for incomplete inactivation leading to exacerbation of disease if the partially (or suboptimal) induced immunity cooperates with infectivity by mechanisms such as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). In this case, monocytes or macrophages (Fc-receptors bearing cells) can be infected by virus complexed to non-neutralizing antibodies, a process described in dengue virus infections [ 12 ] . Finally, another issue with inactivated vaccines is overcoming the differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals not to interfere with the surveillance diagnostics. While formaldehyde reacts primarily with proteins, β-propiolactone (BPL) and binary ethylenimine (BEI) modify mainly DNA or RNA so BPL is expected to maintain a high immunogenicity during the inactivation of viruses. However it has been reported that BPL may also and react to some amino acids including cysteine, methionine, and histidine so certain modifi cation of proteins may also affect the immunogenicity of BPL vaccines. Similarly BEI has been also shown to react with proteins [ 13 ] . This compound is used widely for the inactivation of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the preparation of vaccines. Nonetheless, inactivated vaccines remain as a leading methodology for vaccine production (both for human and veterinary use) in part due to the effectiveness of adjuvants (mainly aluminum salts) in the vaccine formulations overcoming the main issue of limited immunity. In fact, this technology may benefi t from other inactivation approaches such as the use of hydrogen peroxide or protonating compounds, such as diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC). Hydrogen peroxide could inactivate both DNA and RNA viruses (vaccinia virus, LCMV, WNV and YFV) with little damage to the antigenic structure, thus minimizing the effect on immunogenicity. More interestingly, this inactivation approach rendered vaccines able to induce both humoral (neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immune responses including WNV and LCMV specifi c CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells [ 14 , 15 ] . Using a histidine-protonating agent such as DEPC it was reported the abolishment of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infectivity and pathogenicity in mice. These animals survived a further lethal challenge and this protection was associated to the induction of neutralizing antibodies [ 16 ] although no further reports have arose since the fi rst description. In spite of the advances made in different technologies for stimulating the immune responses the classic inactivation methodology is still broadly used to manufacture many vaccines for veterinary use, in part since manufacturers need to balance carefully the investment needed to adapt their traditional manufacturing processes to the new technologies and the expected profi tability. Other classical inactivation techniques by physical methods have been exposure to several types of radiation: thermal, electromagnetic or ionizing. UV radiation has been one of the most used in human vaccine manufacturing.",24.4247658337858,9.422420077025624

For DENV, heterologous secondary infection, i.e., with a different serotype approximately 2 y post-infection, carries an increased risk for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) whereas earlier exposures are protective.122 Studies by Halstead demonstrated that the severity of secondary infection correlated with presence of non-neutralizing antibodies in sera that increase in vitro cellular viral entry123 - a phenomenon termed antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. In one prospective study of Thai children, of serum collected in the 6 month period before secondary infection, sera from 4 (13%) of 32 children with asymptomatic secondary DENV infection demonstrated ADE vs. 6 of 9 (67%) with severe infection.124 In contrast, 2 subsequent prospective Thai studies of greater than 200 children with secondary DENV infection did not demonstrate any relationship between severe infection and ADE.125,126",39.319729240373924,17.143953995975508

NHP dengue infection models include rhesus macaque and chimpanzees. Both NHP models showed detectable viremia when they were inoculated through subcutaneous or intradermal injections. Especially, rhesus macaque presented anti-DENV immune responses including T-cell responses and showed lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, mild dehydration and mild rash. However, chimpanzee models do not show symptoms of DENV (Table 1). Studies on the number of DENV required to infect NHPs have estimated that 104-106 PFU of DENV are delivered by a mosquito bite, and subcutaneous inoculation of this titer could lead to sustainable viral replication [25]. However, NHPs have a limitation in that they do not present clinical symptoms [2627]. However, when DENV was administered at high concentration via the intravenous route, hemorrhage appeared 3 days after infection [28]. As DENV serotypes evoke cross-reactive antibody responses in humans, secondary DENV infection of NHPs also induces increased viremia due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [27], which was experimentally proven by the fact that injection of an anti DENV monoclonal antibody leads to a 3- to 100-fold increase in viremia in NHPs [29]. Although NHPs exhibit immunologically similar responses, such as viremia and ADE, they do not develop vascular leaks, DHF, or DSS, which limits the use of NHP models for the study of pathogenesis/immunopathogenesis.",32.10804448029483,14.77226619447648

(2007) found a peptide, P1, which was isolated from the murine brain cDNA phage display library by biopanning against the recombinant WNV E protein 137. When P1 was tested against DENV-2, it inhibited ~99% DENV-2 at a concentration of 200 µM. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) showed that P1 bound to the WNV E protein with a Kd of 6 µM. However, the specific binding site on E protein and the mode of action are unknown. Other peptides that blocked DENV infection by binding to the E proteins were DN57 opt and 1OAN1 138. In the study, a set of peptides were computationally designed based on the pre-entry dimeric E structure. Peptides DN57 and 1OAN1 specifically designed from the hinge of domain II and the first domain I/domain II connection, was shown to display IC50 of 8 and 7 µM, respectively 138. Both peptides were shown to bind specifically (affinities ~1 µM) to the purified DENV-2 E protein. Images from cryoEM suggested that these peptides might have caused structural deformations to the DENV-2 surface, hence interfering the virus-host cell binding. Further study of peptide inhibitors 1OAN1 and DN59 has also revealed that both peptide inhibitors were able to inhibit the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) effect in vitro with an IC50 of 3 µM and 6 µM, respectively 139. In a recent study, Chew et al. (2015) identified a novel peptide, peptide gg-ww, by biopanning a randomised phage display peptide library against the purified DENV-2 viral particles 140. Approximately 96% inhibition was achieved at the concentration of 250 µM and the data indicated that peptide gg-ww inhibited DENV-2 entry.

This did not include efforts to optimize either the dose or timing of the vaccinations which could certainly impact the magnitude and consistency of the induced responses. As such, it may be possible to achieve a more prominent and uniform response through optimizing the dose and/or timing of vaccination.

We have addressed this task of “epitope reconstitution” by implementing a novel combinatorial approach.60 The RBS of SARS Coronavirus (SARS CoV) is contained in a sub-domain of the viral spike of about 200aa. The actual surface that contacts the viral receptor is less than 40 amino acid residues situated on two discontinuous antiparallel beta strands.60,61 Using combinatorial linkers to bridge the two strands of the bona fide RBS has enabled the affinity selection of functionally reconstituted neutralizing epitopes of the virus.60 This same approach has since been found effective for the reconstitution of neutralizing epitopes of MERS Coronavirus and Dengue virus (not published).

FcRn binds to IgG within the acidic environment of endocytic vacuoles but not at physiological pH. Immune complexes that bind to FcRn are sorted to antigen-processing endosomes or recycling endosomes. However, monomeric IgGs are sorted into recycling endosomes, which recycle IgGs back to the cell surface following endocytosis, thus preventing intracellular degradation of IgGs. This allows antibodies or immune complexes to persist in the blood circulation for up to several weeks after treatment. Mutations at positions 250 (Thr250Gln) and 428 (Met428Leu) can significantly increase binding to FcRn and half-life of antibodies without affecting antigen-binding and Fc-mediated effector functions [36,37]. While improved affinity to FcRn can extend the half-life of antibodies [38]; this has never been linked with increased clinical efficacy. However, in vivo studies with a hFcRn/Rag1 knockout mouse model suggest that the antitumor activity of bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) and cetuximab (anti-EGF) can be significantly improved when binding to FcRn was increased [39]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that administration of a broadly neutralizing antibody with enhanced FcRn affinity can improve protection against HIV-1 infection in nonhuman primates, not only by increasing serum half-life but also by enhancing transcytosis of antibodies to mucosal surfaces [40,41]. With slower clearance of antibodies and improved protection, less frequent dosing schedules would be expected, potentially reducing compliance issues. Moreover, the extended half-life would ensure that the levels of circulating antibodies are kept sufficiently high for virus neutralization. This would also minimize the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection, which would be particularly useful for viruses such as DENV, where ADE is hypothesized to result in increased viremia and increased risk of severe dengue [6,42–44]. However, the effects of improved half-life of these antibodies should be tested to avoid any potential toxic adverse effects.",28.17213798639368,12.692257068326242

However, because most viruses pose no major threat to their host, they pass by unnoticed leaving the majority of virus genome space uncharted. With the availability of cost-efficient genome sequencing technology, and recent developments in the field of viral metagenomics, large-scale identification of viral genome space is on the rise (Rosario and Breitbart 2011; Mokili et al. 2012). By exploring viral diversity, critical components constituting a viral genus’ fitness can be evaluated. Examples such as the common influenza virus illustrate the rapidity of viral gene mutation and in order to maintain immune protection, an annual flu vaccination is recommended. Underway efforts aim to generate broadly neutralizing vaccines whose design accounts for the genomic sequences of multiple types of influenza virus to eliminate frequent re-vaccination against the flu (Giles and Ross 2011, 2012). Development of broadly neutralizing vaccines often relies on the consensus or ancestral sequences of extant viral sequences in order to provide greater coverage for related viruses (Kesturu et al. 2006). Unfortunately, consensus sequences can be misleading, and ancestral sequence reconstruction is error-prone for quickly diverging sequences (McCloskey et al. 2014). In addition, viruses with compact genomes often express proteins with structural disorder that may undergo structural transformations. Although these transformer proteins, like VP40 in Ebola, are masters at changing their structure, and thus expanding their functional repertoire as needed for the life cycle of the virus (Bornholdt et al. 2013), flexible regions are potentially important in rewiring protein–protein interactions between the virus and its host (Le Breton et al. 2011; Ortiz et al. 2013; Gitlin et al. 2014). The flexibility trait of many viral proteins is a complicating factor in vaccine development. For instance, Dengue virus exhibits serotype-specific antibody affinity that causes antibody-dependent enhancement, an obstacle in the development of Dengue vaccines that protects against all four serotypes (Flipse and Smit 2015). To overcome the hurdle posed by structural flexibility, we propose an additional screening step in identifying potential vaccine or antiviral targets that considers the structural flexibility of the viral proteins. The Structural Genomics Initiatives increased their success rate by excluding proteins predicted to be structurally disordered (Slabinski et al. 2007). A similar approach can perhaps benefit vaccine development. Furthermore, to make this approach robust to potential mutations, minimizing loss in efficacy or resistance, the evolutionary context of sequence and structure must be considered. Thus, we suggest expanding the concept of broadly neutralizing vaccines/antivirals by increasing the diversity of viruses considered if possible. Sites conserved for sequence, structure, and with low disorder propensity among diverse virus protein homologs are very likely to be constrained from 1) changing sequence on evolutionary time scales and 2) undergoing real-time structural transitions. These sites have potential as targets for broad-specificity antivirals or vaccines because conservation makes them broad-specificity and low dynamics avoids targeting a conformational ensemble, which is not only difficult (Yu et al. 2016), but that may change as the sequence diverges (Siltberg-Liberles et al. 2011).",15.907051031648162,10.122737066647078

However, additional mechanisms of EBOV entry into macrophages are also likely to be important, particularly in light of our findings that 7Gm8G pseudovirions have ~300% better transduction of macrophages than GP, yet 7Gm8G transduces hMGL-expressing cells at ~60% of the transduction level of the WT.

Engagement of TRIM21 results in rapid postentry elimination of antibody–virus via recruitment of the proteasomal machinery (32,33), in a mechanism termed antibody-dependent cellular neutralization (ADIN).

In addition, there is great interest in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies specific for major human pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus (2,3). Neutralization of viruses by antibodies is predicted to depend on high-affinity binding to specific epitopes of surface-exposed viral proteins that are required for binding to target cell receptors (4). Such antibodies are thought to function according to the occupancy model that requires binding of a critical number of antibodies to a viral particle in such a way that most or all neutralizing epitopes are occupied (5). This may occur independently, or in concert with other antibody-mediated effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (6,7). These effector functions are induced upon binding of antibody–virus immune complexes to classical Fc γ receptors (FcγRs) expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which results in clearance and induction of T-cell responses (8). Neutralizing antibodies also prevent infection in concert with non-classical Fc receptors such as the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) (9,10). While FcRn mediates bidirectional transport of IgG across mucosal epithelial surfaces (11–15), pIgR mediates unidirectional transcytosis of IgA and IgM from the tissue into the luminal space (9). Transcellular transport of neutralizing but also non-neutralizing antibody has been shown to facilitate protection against viral infection (9,16–21).",15.288005702092951,7.964053735472904

A group based in Korea has accordingly explored a variety of options of producing DIII-derived vaccines in plants, including fusion of a DIII with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and production in transgenic tobacco;45 fusing a consensus DIII, which elicits neutralising antibodies against all 4 dengue virus serotypes, to M cell-targeting peptide ligand (Co1), producing it in transgenic rice calli and showing it was targeted to the mucosal immune system in mice;46 and modifying the recombinant immune complexes (RIC) shown to work for Zaire ebolavirus GP1 by fusing the Ebola GP1 epitope binding the 6D8 mAb to the dengue virus consensus DIII domain, and then to the mAb, and producing it transiently in tobacco.47 The purified hybrid dengue-Ebola RIC (DERIC) bound C1q, and elicited potent virus-neutralising Abs in mice without the use of adjuvants.

Immunogenicity involves minimising non-human sequences by creating chimeric, humanised or human versions of the antibodies with as few T-lymphocyte epitopes as possible [18]. Antibody fragments are usually less immunogenic due to a lack of Fc domain [19]. Antigen-binding affinity can be improved by using phage display libraries to isolate antibodies with strong affinities for the antigen. However, sometimes antibodies with a lower affinity for the antigen may be required to allow better penetration of a tumour [20]. Effector functions can be improved by genetically engineering the Fc region to contain point mutations or glycan modifications. Yamane-Ohnuki and Satoh review and discuss the development of defucosylated antibodies which have increased affinities for the FcγRIIIa receptor and enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [21]. A particularly interesting aspect of antibody efficacy is its unique pharmacokinetic characteristics once inside the body. For example, it has been noted that the bioavailability of IgG in plasma is partially dependent on its interaction with the neonatal Fc/Brambell receptor (FcRn) [22]. The FcRn functions as a salvage receptor that leads to the rescue of IgG internalised in cells from degradation by lysosomes and causes recycling of antibodies into the plasma, thus prolonging its half-life [23]. The plasma half-life of IgG can also be increased by developing antibodies (e.g. through phage display) with increased affinity for FcRn [24]. Antibody fragments treated with polyethylene gycol (PEGylation) have also been shown to have an increased plasma half-life [25].",14.24272402185057,6.653136880400271

We consider this assumption of full efficacy for five-fold fractionation to be the most likely scenario, despite the lack of efficacy data on any YF vaccine, for several reasons: 1) two studies of five- or greater-fold vaccination doses have shown indistinguishable immunogenicity in humans; 2) at least some preparations of YF vaccine substantially exceed the WHO minimum standard for potency of 1,000 IU/dose, so fractionation at some level could be performed without dropping below that threshold; 3) YF vaccine is live attenuated virus, so a biological rationale exists that if a productive vaccine-virus infection can be established by a fractionated dose, protection should be comparable to that with a higher dose. Nonetheless, to assess the robustness of the conclusion that dose fractionation is likely to be beneficial, against the possibility that in fact efficacy of fractionated doses is lower than anticipated, we consider the possibility that five-fold fractionated dosing fails to immunize a proportion (1−VE(5)) of recipients. We find that as long as at least 20% of recipients are fully immunized by the vaccine, more people would be immunized by vaccinating five times as many people with one-fifth the dose, and so the population-wide benefits of higher coverage would outweigh the lower efficacy of fractionated dosing for individual vaccinees.",13.026970981547194,9.564025169259445

In the research, the primates were firstly immunized with a DNA vaccine three times at 0, 4, 8 weeks at a dose of 4 mg, and then boosted with 1010 PFU AdHu5 which expressed GP protein of Ebola virus 20 weeks post prime. The results showed high antibody titers and CD4+T cell responses were induced in vaccinated animals, and the vaccinated groups had a higher survival rates than the control groups after challenged with Ebola virus.116 Since this experiment took more than six months to complete the immunization flow chart, researchers developed an accelerated immunization method for the vaccination.117 In the accelerated experiments, the animals were given AdHu5 expressing GP and NP of Ebola virus twice at doses of 2×1012 vp with a 9-week interval. The vaccinated animals were challenged with lethal Ebola virus and the protection was highly effective since the Ebola-specific CD8+ T cell and antibody responses were well induced. In the subsequent study, the animals were only primed with rAd–GP/NP and challenged 28 days later, but they still had high survival rates with either low or high doses of challenged virus. As the AdHu5-based Ebola vaccine showed a good prospect in the non-human primates, the first clinical trial based on AdHu5 was performed,72 with a recombinant vaccine encoding the envelope GP from the Zaire and Sudan Ebola virus tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, phase I human study. Thirty-one healthy adults received a single dose of the rAdHu5 at 2 × 109 vp (n = 12), or 2 × 1010 vp (n = 11) or placebo (n = 8). The results indicated the antibody responses to the two GPs in subjects were not well balanced. In the low dose group, antibody responses to Zaire GP were 50%, and 58% to Sudan GP. However, the antibody responses in the high dose group were 55% and 100%, respectively. In this study, the pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5 was also noted, but it didn't appear to affect the T cell response to Ebola GP since 32% to 82% subjects responded with more CD4+ than CD8+ T cells.",9.473257235768388,7.850652837980819

From a recent report, an H229Y mutation in the upper hinge of the Hc from a human IgG1 antibody improved both the stability and the ADCC function (by 3-fold) by preventing cleavage of the Hc-Hc disulfide bond through radical-induced degradation.28 The enhancement of ADCC activity by the H229Y is correlated with a higher affinity for FcγR.28 Unlike the H229Y mutant, λdS did not show improved binding to FcγRIIIa V158, FcγRIIIa F158 or FcγRIa by ELISA compared with the native IgG (data not shown). Nevertheless, the serine deletion mutant demonstrated enhanced ADCC activity. The improvement in ADCC activity resulting from the deletion of the terminal serine was interesting and unexpected. This suggests that the increase in ADCC activity resulting from the serine deletion in the λ Lc is operating through mechanisms different from the mutation in the upper hinge region of the Hc. The discrepancy between the results from binding and ADCC assays in our study might be due to differences in the assay formats. It is hypothesized that a conformational change in the hinge region induced by the deletion of serine could affect the FcγR binding site only upon binding to both cell surface antigen and cell surface FcγR, which occur only in the ADCC assay, but not in the ELISA binding assay. This hypothesis was partially corroborated by our effector cell activation data where λdS induced a greater increase in the activation of Jurkat cells than the parental λ antibody upon binding to target cells. Additionally, unlike the hinge stabilizing mutant H229Y, a more stable disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc due to deletion of the terminal Lc residue is likely to have more indirect effect on the stability of the hinge and less effect on FcγR binding. In conclusion, further studies are needed on the detailed mechanism of ADCC enhancement resulting from the deletion of the C-terminal serine of Cλ in order to determine whether the effect can be generalized to other antibodies.",8.483393289424772,7.517891619823603

It is known that the Lc has to displace the chaperone BiP, which associates with the Hc in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to form the final LHHL complex that allows for the secretion of intact antibody.45 Since the native λ Lc has a weaker disulfide bond interaction between the Lc and the Hc, compared with the λ Lc with the serine deletion, more unassembled native λ Lc can be retained in the ER by forming covalent complexes with microsomal proteins.46 For the dS mutant, we hypothesize based on our study that better association between Lc and Hc through improved disulfide bond interaction during the assembly process in the ER may lead to more properly assembled LHHL IgG1 complex and a higher secretion level.",8.576267075408449,7.079162384226057

Notably, febrile UTI may cause pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring [10]. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and treat febrile UTI promptly. However, in some cases, the diagnosis of febrile UTI in young children is difficult because of the lack of specific symptoms in a considerable proportion of young children. Moreover, several practical problems such as collecting appropriate urine samples and discriminating between insignificant pyuria or bacteriuria from a true UTI can hinder making an accurate diagnosis of UTI in infants [11]. As a result, clinicians may be confused as to whether patients should be treated with antibiotics or if imaging methods are necessary for evaluating UTI-associated urological anomalies, especially before obtaining the results of urine culture to confirm an infection. Therefore, more specific markers of UTI besides abnormal urinalysis results are needed. Previous studies have suggested several potential biomarkers for this purpose, including procalcitonin, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule-1 for detecting UTI, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), or renal scarring [121314].

As evidenced by infections with inactivated nef mutations or deletions in rhesus macaques and humans, an intact nef gene is required in vivo for sustained viremia and development of immunodeficiency [40-42]. Although Nef does not exert any enzymatic activity, it fulfills a multitude of functions that culminate in alteration of cell signaling and activation by interfering with the cellular vesicular trafficking machinery. Association of Nef with membranes is governed by its myristoylation; it is also incorporated in virus particles. Downregulation of several cell surface receptors, including CD4 and coreceptors, as well as MHC class I and II receptors and modulation of transcriptional activity of infected T-cells are established functions of HIV-1 Nef. Another long-appreciated activity of Nef is the enhancement of HIV-1 particle infectivity. Production of HIV-1 devoid of an intact nef gene results in impaired particle infectivity, ranging from 3 to 40-fold reduced titers, depending on the producer cell type, target cell type and viral isolate [43, 44]. The most pronounced requirement for Nef is seen in lymphoid cells. Nef-mediated enhancement of particle infectivity requires its expression in the producer cell, is highly conserved within primate lentiviruses [45] and is maintained during disease progression [46]. The fact that Nef is incorporated into virions and cleaved by HIV-1 protease during maturation of particles may support a specific function of virus-incorporated Nef that manifests itself early during the next round of infection. Its membrane association may be sufficient to result in virion packaging, since Nef is also found in orthologous retroviruses when co-expressed in the producer cell. Recently, the mechanism of Nef-mediated infectivity enhancement has been elucidated [47, 48]. Using differential mRNA sequencing in different producer cell lines that differ in their requirement for Nef for optimal HIV-1 infectivity [47], and mass spectrometry-based approaches [48], respectively, members of the serine incorporator (SERINC) family were identified as potent cellular inhibitors of retrovirion particle infectivity in the absence of Nef. SERINC proteins are highly conserved, multi-pass transmembrane proteins expressed predominantly at the plasma membrane with poorly elucidated cellular functions besides that they mediate serine incorporation into phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids [49]. SERINC5, which is abundantly expressed in PBMCs, and SERINC3 were reported to inhibit HIV-1 in the absence of Nef in a dose-dependent and synergistic fashion that appears to require SERINC incorporation in the virion. SERINC5 inhibition acts specifically against Env-containing particles, since VSV-G pseudotypes were largely insensitive to SERINC5 [47, 48]. Nef was shown to counteract SERINC activity by downregulating it from the cell surface via clathrin-dependent endocytosis and sequestering it in endosomes, thus precluding their incorporation into virion particles. Interestingly, the prototypic retrovirus MLV has evolved its own antagonist (Glyco-gag) to counteract SERINC5 [47, 48], underlining the importance of this antiviral factor. Interestingly, expression of SERINC3 and SERINC5 are not induced or stimulated by type I interferons, in contrast to the targets of most other viral antagonists [47]. The antiviral activity of SERINC5 appears to be caused predominantly by post-entry defects, since the detectable slight inhibition of virus-cell fusion does probably not fully account for the far more pronounced infectivity decrease imposed by physiological levels of SERINC5 expression [47, 48]. Future work is needed to fully understand the antiviral mode of action of SERINC proteins, and to decipher whether other enveloped viruses are prone to SERINC-mediated inhibition, and how exactly Nef counteracts SERINC proteins. Notably, a better understanding of the SERINC-imposed antiviral block to infection and the potential Nef-SERINC interface might be translated into the design of a small antiviral molecule that interrupts Nef-SERINC interaction and allows full-blown SERINC-mediated HIV-1 inhibition.",7.793763442958058,6.744389835440747

Because near normal anti-WNV antibody responses were observed in fB−/− or fD−/− mice, activation of the alternative pathway is not required for priming the antibody response against WNV. Our results are consistent with studies which demonstrate that fB−/− mice exhibit normal B cell priming to T cell–independent and T cell–dependent antigens (47). We observed a transient delay in the development of antiviral IgG but not IgM in the absence of C1q, consistent with previous reports of defects in primary T cell–dependent IgG but not IgM responses in C1q−/− mice (46). Our data suggests the contribution of the classical pathway to anti-WNV antibody priming is relatively minor and could be secondary to the defect observed in splenic infection. The most severe defect in anti-WNV antibody development was observed in the absence of C4, where IgM responses were blunted and IgG responses were delayed. Since the C1q−/− mice exhibited normal IgM responses, the C4-dependent lectin pathway could play an important role in priming the antiviral IgM against WNV. Although no study has directly evaluated the contribution of the lectin pathway to antiviral antibody responses, this idea is consistent with work on HSV in which both the primary and memory antiviral humoral responses were blunted in C4−/− mice (3, 48). Defects in MBL function and lectin pathway activation have been suggested to predispose individuals to HIV-1 (49), HSV-2 (7), severe acute respiratory syndrome (50), and chronic hepatitis B infection (51). We speculate that the lectin pathway may have an essential role in the priming of humoral responses against some pathogens.",8.982049703679293,6.318681311635805
sufficient complement-dependent antigen trapping occurs for antigen presentation and priming of antiviral adaptive immune responses,0.2285101438825325,2.4472217559814453,2.611013412475586,1c9852cf-d3b3-493d-bd88-1aacc90d169b,noncomm_use_subset/Protective immune responses against West Nile virus are primed by distinct complement activation pathways,"A surprising result was the requirement of C1q and C4 for normal levels of WNV infection in the spleen and draining lymph node. In the absence of C1q, infectious virus was not detected in the spleen, and 100,000-fold less WNV RNA was measured on day 6 after infection. Additionally, WNV infection of the draining inguinal lymph nodes was reduced in the absence of C1q beginning on day 3 after infection. In the absence of C4, fewer spleen samples contained less infectious virus than those of wild-type animals, and less WNV RNA was detected in the spleen and draining inguinal lymph node. At first glance, this observation appears consistent with earlier in vitro studies that showed complement and antiviral IgM enhanced WNV infection in macrophages (42, 43). Although these studies suggested that IgM-dependent fixation of C3 split products (e.g., C3b, C3dg, or iC3b) on WNV enhanced infection, our prior studies with secreted IgM−/− or C3−/− mice showed normal WNV splenic infection (15, 20). Based on this, we speculate that C1q directly or indirectly interacts with WNV to facilitate splenic infection. Direct C1q interaction with viral glycoproteins has been observed for HIV-1, human T cell lymphotropic virus-1, and Moloney murine leukemia virus (6), and C1q-dependent enhancement of infection has been demonstrated in vitro for both HIV-1 and Ebola viruses (44, 45). Our data clearly establishes that WNV infection in the spleen does not significantly contribute to viremia or CNS seeding. Somewhat paradoxically, decreased productive splenic infection did not dramatically alter the induction of primary antiviral B and T cell immune responses to WNV. This apparently contrasts with studies which show that follicular localization in the spleen is complement dependent and required for the development of antibody responses to soluble antigen (46) and vesicular stomatitis virus (2). For WNV, we hypothesize that T and B cell priming may occur in other secondary lymphoid tissues. Alternatively, despite an absence of productive viral infection in the spleen, sufficient complement-dependent antigen trapping occurs for antigen presentation and priming of antiviral adaptive immune responses.",8.0472611831466,6.1043942735983805

However, VES is resource-intensive to estimate as it requires testing all trial participants, either by periodically conducting assays for infection throughout the trial, or by serologic testing at the trial's conclusion if natural and vaccine-derived immune responses can be distinguished. Testing trial participants is also necessary for estimating a vaccine's efficacy against progression (VEP) to symptoms, another critical outcome measurement (8) . As noted in an analysis of dengue vaccine trial results, protection against symptomatic infection may in general differ from protection against infection (and in the case of dengue, VEP may be negative due to antibody dependent enhancement) (15) .

In particular, the special concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue arising from antibody-dependent enhancement strongly emphasizes the irreplaceable role of its NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) as a target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design due to its absolutely-essential role in viral replication. Very recently we identified two small molecules inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in non-competitive mode, with Ki values of 0.57 and 2.02 µM respective for p-Nitrophenyl-p-guanidino benzoate and qucertin. Here, by molecular docking, we show that although one is designed compound while another is a natural product, both molecules bind to the same pocket on the back of the substratebinding pocket of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. As the two inhibitors fundamentally differ from cn-716, the only known peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor in both structure scaffolds and inhibitory modes, our discovery might open up a new avenue for the future development of allosteric inhibitors, which is highly demanded to achieve therapeutic inhibition of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes. Furthermore, as qucertin is abundant in many vegetables and fruits such caper, lovage, tea and red onion, our results should benefit the public to immediately fight Zika virus. author/funder.

The antibodies to the S1 and RBD domains of spike protein are highly subtype-specific, consistent with the high variability in these sequences between different human coronaviruses. Conversely, the S2 domain of spike protein and NP protein are more cross-reactive, consistent with these sequences being highly conserved across coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide pandemic despite likely pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies to S2 domain and NP protein in most people, indicating that these antibodies are likely not protective, whereas antibodies to S1 and RBD domains are more likely to be protective. This observation favors a vaccination strategy based on S1 or RBD domains of spike protein over a vaccination strategy that also includes S2 domain or NP protein. In addition, S1 and RBD domains are more likely to generate subtype-specific serologic tests for population surveillance studies. In addition, a key unexplained finding during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has been the low incidence of infection in children aged 15 and younger. This observation generates two related hypotheses: adults may have pre-existing antibodies against antigenically distinct coronaviruses that produce an ineffective humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (antibody-dependent enhancement as demonstrated for dengue virus), or children younger than 15 may have initially encountered a coronavirus that is more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 so are more protected against this infection (immunologic imprinting or original antigenic sin as demonstrated for influenza virus). Both of these hypotheses would be informed by comparing the level of cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies in pediatric and adult cohorts and correlating these antibodies with incidence of severe disease.",13.927373207851966,8.236858511999896

First, SARS-Cov-2 infects patients by binding human ACE2, 29, 30 which is widely expressed in multiple organs throughout the body. 31 SARS-CoV-2 might lead to multi-system inflammation through ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway. 32, 33 Second, it was reported that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses might also be involved in COVID-19. ADE can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, which makes it a possible explanation for the geographic limitation of severe cases. 34 Third, combined infections may lead to a more severe systemic inflammatory response. Indeed, in our study, some patients combined with infection in other organs (e.g. urinary tract, blood) and other pathogen (e.g. influenza virus, fungus). Fourth, shock, hypoxemia and coagulation pathway abnormalities in critical patients could aggravate systemic inflammatory response, which become a vicious cycle, threatening life. 35, 36 In our study, CRRT was associated with prolonged survival in COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. CRRT is a widely used blood purification therapy, which achieves a high solute clearance rate through diffusion, convection, ultrafiltration, and adsorption. The primary goal of CRRT is to compensate for the loss of renal function and associated sequelae, including uremic toxins, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload 37 . Besides these, CRRT can also remove cytokines from the bloodstream. Emerging evidence has shown that CRRT was associated with significantly lower mortality in patients with severe sepsis. 18, 19, 38 In addition, in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, CRRT could remove All rights reserved.

Human coronaviruses and other influenza viruses resulted in epidemic in last 2 decade in different parts of the world. The anomalies between severity and spreading between the origin site, China and the other parts of the World (European and North America countries) might have some indication. Common human CoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the US, and individual human CoVs may show variable circulation from year to year. [12] Colder climate and prior exposure to other human coronaviruses, or influenza or flu viruses or possible vaccination against those might develop antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of immunological responses during recent SARS CoV-2 exposure. ADE might have modulated immune response and could elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm [13, 14] . Possibly, that could be one of the reasons (more history of exposure with CoVs beside weaker immune system) for older people being more affected by the present SARS CoV-2.

The potentiality of in silico methods can be exploited to find desired solutions with fewer trials and errors and thus saving both time and costs of the scientists. In this study, potential subunit vaccines were designed against the SARS-CoV-2 using various methods of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. To design the vaccines, the highly antigenic viral proteins as well as epitopes were used. Various computational studies of the suggested vaccine constructs revealed that these vaccines might confer good immunogenic response. For this reason, if satisfactory results are achieved in various in vivo and in vitro tests and trials, these suggested vaccine constructs might be used effectively for vaccination to prevent the coronavirus infection and spreading.
