These outbreaks have seriously stretched local and national resources in the economically developed world, whereas the capacity to control emerging diseases remains limited in poorer regions where many of them have their origin. A number of virus-specific antiviral agents have been developed and commercialized since the early 1980s. These agents, including drugs that specifically inhibit members of the Herpesviridae family, influenza viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and, more recently, hepatitis C virus (HCV), had a major medical impact 1 . However, the development costs of specific antiviral agents are extremely high and there are many other medically important viral infections that require efficacious therapies. Thus, there is an urgent need for new families of broad-spectrum antiviral agents, that is, antiviral agents that are active against a number of different viral families 2 . Such compounds should target mechanisms common to different families of viruses, such as cellular components and/or functions involved in their life cycles. The cellular proteins cyclophilins have been shown to play a key role in the life cycle of a number of different viral families. In addition, cyclophilin inhibitors were reported to inhibit the replication of different viruses, both in vitro and in vivo 3, 4 .

But the degree of cross-protection provided by such vaccines is greatly limited due to the extensive diversity in antigenic variants even within the strains of a phylogenetic sub-cluster (Graham et al. 2013) . As for MERS and SARS coronaviruses, there is no licensed specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available till now. However, few of the advances made in developing vaccines and therapeutics for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could be exploited for the countering 2019-nCoV. But since the efforts to design and develop any vaccine or antiviral agent to tackle the presently emerging coronavirus pathogen would take some time, therefore till then we need to rely extensively on enforcing highly effective prevention and control measures to minimize the risk of 2019-nCoV transmission and spread to the best feasible extent (Cheng et al. 2020) . Majority of the vaccines that are being developed for coronaviruses targets the Spike glycoprotein or S protein (Graham et al. 2013) . This is mainly because of the fact that S protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies (Jiang et al. 2005) . Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Among them, the S protein-based vaccines include full-length S protein vaccines, viral vector-based vaccine, DNA-based vaccine, recombinant S proteinbased and recombinant RBD protein-based vaccines. Whereas S protein based antiviral therapies include RBD-ACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs (Du et al. 2009 ). Even though such therapeutic options have proven efficacy in the in vitro studies, however most of these haven't undergone randomized animal or human trials and hence are of limited use in our present 2019-nCoV scenario. Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was intended to be used for the treatment of Ebola virus disease.

Combination therapy with 2019-nCoV specific monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir can be considered as the ideal therapeutic option for 2019-nCoV (Cohen 2020) . Further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy. A variety of different therapeutic and vaccine designing approaches against coronaviruses are being explored and yet to be evaluated in terms of their potency, efficacy and safety, but hopefully the process of evaluation will be accelerated in the coming days (Cyranoski 2020; Lu 2020; Pillaiyar et al. 2020; Zaher et al. 2020 ).",23.68651845944918,11.049765704200155

We further tested the efficiency of our newly designed HBV therapeutic vaccine, consisting T7-EA adjuvant, Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein, in breaking immune tolerance in an HBV mouse model. The HBV mouse model was generated using a recombinant AAV carrying the HBV genome (AAV/HBV) that was previously reported as an appropriate model for developing novel therapies for chronic HBV infection [30] .

The HRV has almost the highest number of serotypes (more than 100) among all respiratory viruses due to mutations of its genome. Antigenic heterogeneity of HRVs is regarded as a major barrier to effective vaccine development which has to be highly polyvalent and has resulted in little progress over 50 years [1, 4] . Other problems, which have impeded rhinoviral vaccine development, include the lack of convenient animal models and as expected the absence of great impact on respiratory morbidity and mortality while reducing the frequency of common colds [5] Today, there are no drugs that destroy viruses; all antiviral agents can only inhibit viral development. Therefore, degradation of the viral RNA seems to be a very promising approach of antiviral therapy. The earliest studies on the antiviral activity of RNases were performed using pancreatic RNase as an agent that quickly normalized the state and decreased the symptoms of meningitis and cerebrospinal pleocytosis in patients with tick borne encephalitis [6] . Shortcoming of mammalian RNases is their affinity to cytosolic RNase inhibitor protein (RI) in human cells by which adventitious mammalian RNases are inhibited. In contrast, bacterial RNases are not inhibited by RI and can retain their catalytic activity in mammalian tissues. One of the wellstudied bacterial RNases is binase, the guanyl-preferring low molecular weight RNase secreted by Bacillus pumilus [7] .",24.160725952391402,9.881939149321717

The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon α2b, interferon β, chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon α2b and interferon β are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",21.363109536768327,9.225184207886919

Currently, several strategies are used in the clinic or under development, such as viral-targeting therapeutics and host-targeting agents (such as interferons, glucocorticoids) for the treatment of COVID-19. As compared with these therapeutic strategies, NAbs appear to be more specific for virions. Understanding of action mechanisms of NAbs may provide valuable implications for the rapid development of antibody therapy and vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. However, the development of NAb-based therapeutics is a timeconsuming and laborious process. To date, no NAb agents for either SARS-CoV or (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) MERS-CoV are available in the market. Meanwhile, a note of caution is that the effect of antibody immune response in protecting against pulmonary pathogenesis of SARS-CoV is controversial [31] .

To date, several formulations have been tested both in animal models and humans, and different categories of immunogens have been developed, including protein-or peptide-based, DNA-and viral vector-based vaccines. Many different vaccine therapies for chronically HBV infected patients have already been evaluated in clinical trials [73] [74] [75] [76] (Table 1 ) and some of them are discussed below. Since adenoviruses have emerged to provide optimal stimulation to the T cell compartment, some strategies have been designed to exploit such properties. Among viral vector-based vaccines, TG1050 consists of a non-replicative adenovirus 5 vector encoding a unique fusion protein composed of modified core, polymerase and selected domains of the envelope proteins.

Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials.

Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) .

However, no approved agents are available for the treatment of JEV infection, and existing vaccines cannot control various types of JEV strains. Drug repurposing is a new concept for finding new indication of existing drugs, and, recently, the concept has been used to discover new antiviral agents. Identifying host proteins involved in the progress of JEV infection and using these proteins as targets are the center of drug repurposing for JEV infection. In this study, based on the gene expression data of JEV infection and the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) data, we identified 286 genes that participate in the progress of JEV infection using systems biology methods. The enrichment analysis of these genes suggested that the genes identified by our methods were predominantly related to viral infection pathways and immune response-related pathways. We found that bortezomib, which can target these genes, may have an effect on the treatment of JEV infection. Subsequently, we evaluated the antiviral activity of bortezomib using a JEV-infected mouse model. The results showed that bortezomib can lower JEV-induced lethality in mice, alleviate suffering in JEV-infected mice and reduce the damage in brains caused by JEV infection.

ASOs specifically bind to complementary DNA/RNA sequences by Watson-Crick hybridization and once bound to the target RNA, inhibit the translational processes either by inducing cleavage mechanisms or by inhibiting mRNA maturation [97] . The use of ASOs was first reported by Zamecnik and Stephenson in 1978 as a potential antiviral therapeutics. They utilized a phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide composed of 13 nucleotides (a 13-mer) that was designed to block Rous sarcoma virus replication [98, 99] . Since then, ASOs ability to selectively inhibit gene expression has generated noteworthy enthusiasm in the scientific and medical community because of its specificity and the breadth of its potential applications as therapeutic agents. An extensive range of oligonucleotide analogs has become available over the past decade and this lead to target validation and development of ASO-based antiviral agents whose efficacy have been reported against various virus types, both in vitro as well as in vivo [100] . For ASOs to be used empirically, modifications of DNAs or RNAs were needed to retain hybridization capacity at the same time increasing stability. Major alterations have been introduced in the phosphodiester bond, the sugar ring, and the backbone to result in three generations of nucleic acid analogs for the synthesis of ASO oligomers. ASO-based antiviral agents are specifically designed to block the translational processes either by (i) ribonuclease H (RNAse H) or RNase P mediated cleavage of mRNA or (ii) by sterically (non-bonding) blocking enzymes that are involved in the target gene translation [97] .",25.365047436606886,9.851914411364197

Nevertheless, current flu vaccination still presents several limitations that make it fall short of expectations in terms of effectiveness. The short duration of vaccine-induced immunity coupled with the intrinsic antigenic drift of influenza viruses resulting from the gradual accumulation of point mutations in the antigenic sites of the HA (and to a lesser extent the NA) surface protein underscore the need of the annual reformulation of vaccine composition. Moreover, the length of the current vaccine manufacturing process (at least 6 months to produce sufficiently large vaccine quantities) demands continual strain selection to be done approximately 8 months before the next flu season (6, 8) . Should an antigenic drift occur during this time window, the possibility of a mismatch between the vaccine composition and circulating strains might negatively affect protection. Even in the absence of seasonal mismatches or the emergence of pandemic strains, insufficient vaccine coverage and suboptimal uptake in specific target groups (i.e., the elderly or the immunocompromised) also compromise vaccine effectiveness.

Hence, it is important to identify effective antiviral agents against FMDV infection. In this study, we found that mizoribine has potent antiviral activity against FMDV replication in IBRS-2 cells. A time-of-drug-addition assay demonstrated that mizoribine functions at the early stage of replication. Moreover, mizoribine also showed antiviral effect on FMDV in vivo.

Interestingly, the phage clone T18 and T25 exhibited binding affinity to G 1 protein and antiviral activity against BEFV (Fig. 3) , whereas other phages with high affinity to G 1 protein did not effectively inhibit the replication of BEFV. This means that the binding affinity of other phages do not necessarily connection with antiviral activity. In addition, a possible explanation of antiviral activity is that the G 1 protein binding phage ligand mediates an inhibitory effect of BEFV infection by competitive binding to receptor binding sites or neutralizing epitopes and thus inhibits the virus attachment/entry. In order to exclude the effect of phage itself on protein binding and antiviral activity against BEFV, we synthesized T18 and T25 peptides in vitro and conducted the reduce plaque assay in vero cells that significantly formed cytopathic plaque during BEFV infection. The results showed that the synthetic peptides could significantly inhibit the formation of cytopathic plaque (Fig. 4) and inhibit BEFV replication in a dose dependent way (Fig. 5) .

New antiviral agents are required to treat HCV infection, but the high mutation rate of HCV hinders the effectiveness of virus-specific inhibitors. Targeting the host enzymes required for HCV to replicate offers a promising new direction for antiviral therapy. During infection, HCV promotes excessive fat accumulation in the liver, which benefits the virus as this promotes formation of lipid droplets, a cellular organelle essential for assembly of new HCV infectious viral particles. Here, we report the development of a specific inhibitor targeting SKI-1/S1P, a host enzyme required for lipid production in human cells. We show that inhibiting SKI-1/S1P activity in human liver cells effectively blocks lipid droplet formation and HCV infection. Many prevalent human viruses, such as dengue, rotavirus, and hepatitis B virus, hijack host lipid metabolic pathways similar to those targeted by HCV to complete their lifecycle.

Vaccination program efficiency is proportional to vaccine potency or efficacy in addition to the degree and success of immunization of the target groups in the population. In brief, it is influenced by other non-vaccine-related factors that could influence the outcome. The ""real world"" picture provided by vaccine effectiveness data is desirable in planning public health initiatives, an advantage that makes these studies attractive. Translating research data into real public health application are a process that has been reengineered by the NIH as part of a road map for future research. Consequently, a new expanded definition of translational research, consisting of four steps was proposed, which fits nicely within the continuum of vaccine research (21) . In this new process of phase I to phase IV clinical trials, safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, and post-licensure effectiveness of a particular vaccine are assessed ending up in phase IV with the burden of the disease (15) .",22.70550497080793,6.93111340996691

Most of the current therapeutics target viral products present only during a productive infection, and the latent virus reservoir is impervious to these treatments. Thus, latency represents an attractive target for viral eradication, and indeed, recent studies using latency-reversing agents showed effectiveness during the treatment of HIV infection [114] [115] [116] . Currently available latency-reversing agents against EBV and KSHV infections [115, [117] [118] [119] , manipulate an epigenetic pathway i.e., histone epigenetic modifications to achieve viral reactivation, and none of them target viral lncRNAs. In this review, we have deduced multiple examples of gammeherpesvirus-encoded lncRNA directly involved in viral lytic reactivation, i.e., KSHV PAN RNA, EBV BHLF1, and OriPts. Targeting them with therapeutics may lead to viral reactivation, which, in combination with other antiviral agents, can create a platform for effective eradication of gammaherpesvirus-associated infections. Also, recent developments in the field of host lncRNA deregulation by gammaherpesvirus latency-associated factors suggest that the therapeutic targeting of these interactions may also be feasible, especially since these contacts are latency specific. It has been shown that during KSHV latency, viral miRNAs and latency proteins target various host lncRNA implicated in cancer, including MEG3, ANRIL, TUG1, and UCA1 [120] . Also, EBV-associated miRNAs have been shown to target numerous host lncRNAs in a RISC-dependent manner [121] . Thus, studies on aberrantly expressed host lncRNAs in gammaherpesvirus-infected cells may aid the development of novel virus-specific therapeutic targets.",34.48519267722517,12.98141181299679

However, there are a few key aspects to carefully note. Although the majority of studies suggest that administration of DIPs/DI genomes have an inhibitory or even therapeutic effect on the standard virus, it is noticeable that the replication process is reduced, but not abolished. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms is needed in order to clear up the standard virus when it comes to clinical use. In addition, the persistence of influenza A virus RNAs was reported in cultured cells under conditions where the virus was not replicating (Marcus and Sekellick, 1977; Cane et al., 1987; Cane and Dimmock, 1990) , thereby indicating an urgent need to further investigate the mechanisms and elimination measures of the persisted DIPs/DI genomes as DIPs/DI genomes have a promising future as an antiviral agent.

The use of effective masks can therefore be even more impactful in children and its effectiveness (including comfort and fit) are especially pertinent in children. Be it in disease outbreaks or environmental disasters, protecting self or protecting others from self, masks remain the mainstay of respiratory disease protection. The study has a few limitations. In our study, the children wore the mask for short durations of time, just about 5 minutes.

The pre-clinical studies of RNAi therapeutics to combat against respiratory infections are summarized in Table 3 .

RNAi molecules offer several advantages as antiviral therapeutics. They can specifically target the conserved region of mRNA sequence in the viral genome, making it effective against mutated viral strains. In addition, RNAi molecules can be designed rapidly to target viral genes, shortening the lead time of developing new antiviral agents, which is particularly useful in response to an infection outbreak. To achieve effective antiviral effect, the viral targets must be essential for the pathogenesis of viral infection and/or replication cycle. It is also desirable that the target genes share similar conserved sequence among different strains to achieve broad viral inhibition.

For these virulent pathogens, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established guidelines for the use of animal models as surrogates for human efficacy for the purpose of licensure. Well-characterized low passage virus preparations are critical in the development and evaluation of all medical countermeasures for these and other potential human pathogens. For this reason, standardized lots of filoviruses are required that are reproducible, highly characterized, and monitored over time for changes in the properties that could adversely affect its use as challenge stock in therapeutic or vaccine studies. The material produced must be of the highest quality, preferably with the highest infectious concentration (titer) and the lowest genomic equivalents (viral genetic material) to infectious virus and the lowest particle to infectious virus ratios achievable. Low ratios are thought to represent an intact virus and fewer numbers of non-infectious or defective interfering particles [3, 4] . One of the keys to success is accurate virus quantification.",24.46201487482411,9.319333642575025

For heterologous production of E7 in tobacco plastids, the expression of E7 as a translational fusion to β-glucuronidase enzyme was attempted. In addition, redirection of E7 into thylakoid lumen was also tried. The use of β-glucuronidase as a fusion protein turned out to be a successful strategy for improving E7 accumulation, and recombinant proteins accumulated ~40 times relative to unfused E7 (Morgenfeld et al. 2014) . A high-risk HPV-16 candidate therapeutic vaccine (LALF32-51-E7) was developed by plastid targeting and resulted in 27-fold higher expression compared to cytosolic targeting in Nicotiana benthamiana.

Moreover, in a cell culture display, antiviral activity of an investigational item can be the aftereffect of host cell death after exposure to the item. Cytotoxicity tests utilize a series of increasing concentrations of the antiviral product to determine what concentration results in the death of 50% of the host cells. This value is referred to as the median cellular cytotoxicity concentration (CC50 or CTC50 or CCIC50). The relative effectiveness of the investigational product in inhibiting viral replication compared with inducing cell death is defined as the therapeutic or selectivity index (CC50 value/EC 50 value). It is desirable to have a high therapeutic index giving maximum antiviral activity with minimal cell toxicity. According to US FDA guidelines, it is recommended to determine CC50 values in both stationary and dividing cells from multiple relevant human cell types and tissues to establish the potential for cell cycle, species, or tissue-specific toxicities.

In consideration of this, and with WHO support, a systematic review/meta-analysis of HSV-2 and risk of HIV acquisition including 54 studies will inform modelling of the potential impact of an HSV-2 vaccine on HIV incidence, and is expected to be published in late 2016. A review of biological mechanisms of HSV-HIV interaction and implications for vaccine development has also been drafted. The pipeline for therapeutic vaccines remains robust, with 5 candidates in clinical development, the most advanced of which now has data demonstrating significant reductions in HSV2 shedding (55%) and days with genital lesions (60%) over 12 months [46] . In response to these positive data, NIAID has formed an HSV working group to propose desired characteristics for therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines for HSV, including indication, priority target populations, clinical trial endpoints, and safety and efficacy criteria.

The major obstacle for developing siRNA for therapeutics is also its targeted delivery with clinically acceptable formulations and reliable routes of administration. This is particularly true of siRNA delivery to bone with its intrinsically poor drug penetration and vascular perfusion. Bone is primarily composed of three cell types: osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. Bone's unique extracellular matrix is strongly mineralized with calcium phosphate, forming ~70 wt% apatite, a major reservoir of the body's calcium most actively involved with physiological calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Increasing molecular and cellular understanding of bone biology has produced continuous reports of new potential therapeutic targets for various bone pathologies. Nonetheless, despite new targets identified as osteoclast-specific, targeting methods are not yet reliably tissue-based specifically with requisite bone-specificity necessary for these therapeutic agents. Serious complications from cross-reactivity with other non-target tissues or poor efficacy due to low drug target tissue concentration require a reliable targeting strategy. Many attempts to improve the targeting of drugs to bone mineral fraction (apatite) include drug conjugation with bone-targeting ligands, such as tetracycline, [234] estradiol, and bisphosphonate. [235, 236] Bisphosphonates, especially N-BPs, as anti-resorptive drugs having intrinsic high affinity to the bone apatite surface, are very attractive for delivery of conjugated non-specific bone therapeutic agents.

Although we have learned a great deal about autophagy at the molecular, biochemical, and cellular levels, the precise role of autophagy in individual diseases remains incompletely understood. Many studies have been limited, showing only an association between the presence of autophagy and the effect of drugs rather than implicating autophagy directly. Future studies need to be more rigorously designed to distinguish the precise role of autophagy in disease states and in the responses to treatment. To date, translating preclinical observations into the clinic has progressed most rapidly in oncology, but major opportunities for progress exist in several other therapeutic areas, including cardiology, neuroscience, and infectious diseases and autoimmunity. 2. It is likely that in each of those disease areas there will be segments of the population more likely to respond than others, thereby requiring the identification of predictive pharmacodynamics and surrogate end-point biomarkers. 3. Most of the current drugs described as modulators of autophagy do not directly or specifically regulate the autophagy process but rather act on the pathways involved in activating or inhibiting this cellular process, which raises the question of specificity. Development of selective inhibitors or activators that act directly on the regulatory targets will rely largely on the identification and further understanding of the key targets that control autophagy and the elucidation of the molecular structure of the targets. In addition, as our sophistication in the discovery of autophagyspecific ligands increases, it may be possible to use concepts now extant in other areas of pharmacology and discover functionally selective autophagy modulators that have an appropriate signaling bias that maximizes therapeutic effects and minimizes side effects. 4. To facilitate the discovery and development of the autophagy-targeted drugs, sensitive, effective, reliable, and accurate high-throughput screening (HTS) assays would need to be established and chemical libraries enriched for new scaffolds. 5. As the modulators of autophagy (either inhibitors or activators) are expected to be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents, the possible drug-drug interactions, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, might present a potential problem that should be considered in designing and developing autophagy-targeted drugs and therapeutic regimens.",19.573901363743232,8.342476749406764

The initial stages would be very similar to those followed for vaccines under development for conventional infectious diseases. In the United States, the earliest stages would include the development of sufficient preclinical information about the vaccine to allow the preparation of an investigational new drug (IND) application for submission to the FDA (see Chapter 13). The IND may have information unique to the vaccine candidate but should include information about the rationale for the vaccine design, the source of the virus and other components, the manufacture of the active vaccine component, formulation, preliminary characterization of the vaccine to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine. For these agents, it would be too dangerous to conduct challenge studies in humans and the prevalence of the disease is either nonexistent, sporadic, or too small to allow the development of a reasonable clinical protocol. In anticipation of this problem, largely in the face of potential bioterrorist agents, in 2002, the FDA adapted the so-called Animal Rule [see Federal Register, May 31, 2002 (Volume 67, Number 105) ]. Under this guidance, new drugs or biological products that are intended to prevent serious or life-threatening conditions may be approved on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate studies in animals and any additional supporting data, if controlled clinical studies cannot be conducted in human volunteers and field trials are not possible. In order to satisfy this alternative mechanism, however, several criteria must be met.

Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products are not available to treat filovirus diseases. Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered as late as 48 hours after infection. In addition, BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses, including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of non-human primate protection from filovirus disease by a synthetic drug-like small molecule.

Strategies of fighting ZIKV infection include the development of vaccines and the screening of antiviral agents that inhibit different stages of the viral life cycle [14] . Unfortunately, no approved antiviral ZIKV agents are currently available. There is thus an urgent need to develop safe and effective antiviral agents against ZIKV and to elucidate their mechanisms. Doing so should help identify lead compounds which have the potential for further clinical development in the fight against ZIKV. Cephalotaxine (CET), harringtonine (HT), homoharringtonine (HHT), isoharringtonine, and deoxyharringtoninea are alkaloids which can be isolated and purified from the Chinese coniferous tree Cephalotaxus hainanensis [15] . CET has shown promising antiviral activities against hepatitis B [16] and has also been found to have antileukemic activities [17] . Due to their wide range of effects, CET drugs are also believed to have great potential in the treatment of other diseases, including some cancers [18] . HT inhibits CHIKV replication by down-regulating viral protein expression, while HHT shows activity against HBV and the coronavirus. Previous research further determined that both HT and HHT are promising candidates for the treatment of diseases related to the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [16,19e21] . Although such drugs have similar structures, their substituents vary widely, which may translate into differences in pharmacological activity [21] . Therefore, in the current study, we opted to investigate the potential anti-ZIKV activity of CET in Vero cells. Our results indicate that CET indeed possesses anti-ZIKV activity. Thus, we also opted to investigate the potential mechanisms which underlie the anti-ZIKV activity of CET. In so doing, we demonstrated that CET (1) disrupts the viral life cycle by preventing ZIKV from replicating and (2) exhibits virucidal activity against ZIKV.

Interestingly, ribavirin is the only clinically approved broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside. 4, 6 The clinical efficacy of any inhibitor will be antagonized by the development of resistance. Mechanisms of resistance to ribavirin have been studied most extensively in PV [7] [8] [9] and the related foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV).

However, with the development of the first human antiviral drug, idoxuridine, and its later approval in 1963, a new era of antiviral treatment development began (De Clercq and Li 2016) . Because of viral replication cycle, which involves usage of host cell biochemical machinery, antiviral drugs can also affect the function of the host's pathways resulting in the great risk of toxicity. Therefore, the major concern in antiviral drug development is the identification of specific targets with increased selectivity and reduced side effects, which limit the therapeutic use of antiviral drugs in comparison to antibacterial agents (Dal Pozzo and Thiry 2014) . In the early 1900s, state-of-the-art review articles on antiviral chemotherapy in veterinary medicine listed several drawbacks of low antiviral drugs use in veterinary medicine. Those included usage restricted to a single virus and specific animal species, problems with high spectrum activity and low cytotoxicity, high costs of development of new chemical compounds and absence of rapid diagnostic techniques allowing prompt use of a specific antiviral agent in the course of an acute infection (Rollinson 1992a, b) . Most of the antiviral drugs used in animal medicine have been originally developed against human viral infections and their clinical use in veterinary medicine is not widespread and common. Nevertheless, several licensed human antiviral agents are being used with cascade principle for treatment of animal diseases (e.g. acyclovir, idoxuridine and trifluridine against feline herpesvirus-1 ocular infection in cats) (Thiry et al. 2009 ). Currently, the only licensed antiviral drug in veterinary medicine is feline interferonomega (IFN-ω), whose mechanism of action involves a combination of antiviral and immunostimulatory activity (De Clercq and Li 2016; Bracklein et al. 2006) . Most antiviral agents interfere with the synthesis or regulation of viral nucleic acids ( Fig. 22 .1) and act by nucleoside analogues that block elongation of newly synthetized DNA or RNA chain. Other antiviral agents used in veterinary medicine act as neuraminidase (oseltamivir) or amino acid (L-lysine) inhibitors, while novel treatment options such as small inhibitory RNAs are also under investigation (Dal Pozzo and Thiry 2014; Sykes 2013) . In recent years, the use of antiviral agents in veterinary medicine has become more favourable with growing interest in its research. This is partially due to successful outcomes of antiviral therapy in some human diseases and partially due to advances in internal veterinary medicine with the development of novel and sophisticated diagnostic and treatment protocols. In addition to that, current measures for control of viral infections such as vaccination or removal of infected animals from breeding stock by culling have many limitations. Therefore, antiviral agents represent a promising alternative for the treatment of viral diseases in veterinary medicine (Dal Pozzo and Thiry 2014) .",26.996350244695233,11.0014022316585

If new antivirals must be specific for each individual virus, this approach to research has many disadvantages. One way to overcome this problem might be to discover drugs that target common cellular mechanisms that support virus replication. As proposed for influenza viruses (248) , this approach would minimize the possibility of virus resistance, would (presumably) work only in virusinfected cells (see below), would likely reduce unwanted side effects, and could include several drugs that are already licensed for treating other diseases. Suggested cellular targets for influenza antiviral intervention include (I) the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase and p38 MAPK kinase pathways and (II) the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway. Cell culture studies of several unlicensed agents that down regulate these pathways have given promising results (248) . Interestingly, there is considerable molecular cross-talk between these two pathways in endothelial cells (249) , epithelial cells (250) , and macrophages (251) . In each of these cells and in rat kidneys in vivo (252) , statins down regulate both of these pathways. Statins also prevent Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting p38 MAPK (253, 254) . In addition, ARBs inhibit the RAF/MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK pathways (255) (256) (257) . Finally, in septic mice, giving an ARB 30 minutes after cecal ligation and puncture inhibited NF-kappa B, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue, and significantly improved survival (258) . Considered together, these findings suggest that in influenza and perhaps other emerging virus diseases, treatment with statins and ARBs would have much broader effects on the host response than simply interfering with the cellular machinery necessary for virus replication. These effects deserve to be studied in animal models of these diseases.",20.943479066423293,9.923526056474547

Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical value of FCSQ theory were reviewed. Multiple databases (China Network Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wanfang Data, SinoMed, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase) were systematically searched from inception to June 12, 2018. Two authors independently extracted the data and performed a methodological quality assessment of the RCTs. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the data analysis. The effect sizes for the primary outcome measures were expressed as relative risks or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 13 RCTs were selected, involving 12 types of diseases and 4695 patients. The methodological quality of the RCTs was generally low. Five studies compared the effectiveness of TCM treatments guided by FCSQ theory with conventional TCM therapies, and the remaining eight studies compared the effectiveness of TCM treatments guided by FCSQ theory with biomedical treatments. All of the RCTs reported that the effectiveness of the treatment intervention was better than that of the intervention in the control group. Conclusion: Because of many methodological problems in existing clinical studies, it remains impossible to definitively conclude that FCSQ theory can improve clinical effectiveness. It is difficult to unify the clinical application of FCSQ theory. The feasibility and repeatability of FCSQ as an intervention should be given more attention in future clinical research. Future work should also follow international norms for clinical research implementation and reporting to provide high-quality evidence for evaluating the clinical value of FCSQ theory.",23.354028856099703,9.346360603341827

Clearly, the first target would be preventing viral infections. This is becoming more plausible given newly developed vaccine strategies and antiviral agents. For example, the therapeutic monoclonal antibody against RSV, palvizumab (Synagis), is one option. This monoclonal antibody is directed against an epitope in the A antigenic site of the F protein of RSV. Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends its use for high-risk infants during RSV season. 34 In studies examining the long-term outcome of asthma in this particular patient population, it was found that patients who received palvizumab had lower rates of recurrent wheezing compared with those who did not. 35 Giving antivirals for RSV has been shown in other studies to lead to a trend toward less atopy. In a recent study, 36 175 patients who had acute RSV were studied-some received ribavirin and some did not. In the group that received ribavirin, rates of physician-diagnosed wheezing were decreased, along with decreased rates of allergic sensitization. These intriguing data suggest that the prevention or early treatment of viral infections may be able to prevent subsequent development of asthma and atopic disease.",20.88705253739704,9.425189602860234

HFMD, commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) or enterovirus 71 (EV71), can proceed to serious complications such as meningitis, which can be fatal to small infants and children [1] . Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for HFMD; therefore, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs against this viral infection. AG7088 was developed originally to combat human rhinovirus (HRV), which is the major cause of the common cold. In Phase-II clinical trials, AG7088 demonstrated moderate antiviral and clinical efficacy. Because of a lack of efficacy in natural infection studies, further development was stopped. However, AG7088 has received attention again in recent years, because it is now considered a potent inhibitor of EV71 [2] [3] [4] [5] . The compound has been shown to inhibit the viral chymotrypsin-like protease (3C pro ), which is required for proteolytic processing of the large polyprotein translated from the viral RNA genome and is thus essential for the propagation of the virus [6] . As the safety of AG7088 has been confirmed, the development of AG7088 will be a shortcut for HFMD therapy. In addition, AG7088 derivative have also been shown to have antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [7] [8] [9] . Although AG7088 possesses good antiviral activity and has received much attention, there is limited information available in the literature concerning methods for its synthesis. Therefore, an efficient synthesis method for AG7088 is important and will benefit the development of antiviral drugs of this type.

These strategies include structure-based rational design, biochemical enzyme-based screening, and reverse genetic system-based screening. Second, known WNV inhibitors are summarized. Both small and macromolecular inhibitors have been identified to inhibit WNV. The macromolecular inhibitors include WNV antibodies, interferon, and nucleic acid-based agents (i.e., antisense oligomer and siRNA).

Although zanamivir has good antiviral activity, even against oseltamivir-resistant strains, nebulized, or inhaled route would achieve very low systemic concentration. Therefore, the only currently available options are the parenteral forms of zanamivir or peramivir. Unfortunately, resistance in seasonal H1N1 virus was reported even before these parenteral agents were marketed [101] . It is important to remember that early treatment of mild cases by antiviral drugs would decrease viral load more rapidly with earlier resolution of symptoms by one more day, but whether early treatment of those with risk factors for severe disease will prevent progression and death is uncertain. Since the viral load has a plateau by the time of presentation for most severe cases, the efficacy of these parenteral antiviral drugs remains to be determined in formal clinical trials of patients with severe disease.",21.813103321372182,8.81250961160913

Based on animal models and human studies, combining all possible T-and B-cell ligands to formulate an active synthetic vaccine makes sense. This concept would also be especially promising for a therapeutic vaccine. These types of vaccines would be necessary for driving T-cell immunity to eliminate infected cells left in the body after acute infection. Chronic viral infections, such as HIV, HCV and HBV, are in desperate need of a vaccine that would clear lingering virus-infected cells. The success of the current antibody-inducing HBV prophylactic vaccine has meant that only the need for a therapeutic vaccine for chronic disease remains. A number of anti-HBV therapeutic vaccine approaches are being evaluated in the clinic, including recombinant anti-HBV vaccines, lipopeptide-based vaccines [36] or DNA vaccines, with or without immunomodulatory drugs (reviewed in [37] ). Although immunotherapy based on these different vaccine formulations has demonstrated efficient T-cell responses in healthy subjects (prophylaxis), these approaches stimulated only transient clinical responses in patients chronically infected with HBV. Although the diversity of infected patient populations may contribute to the variability of efficacy observed in these vaccine studies, the major unresolved issue involves the composition of the vaccine, including relevant antigens presented by infected cells in vivo and adjuvants that will bias immune responses towards a Th1 profile capable of breaking tolerance in chronic patients. In addition, vaccine delivery systems that can protect the vaccine from degradation, as well as target and facilitate the uptake of both antigens and adjuvant by APCs [38] , have to be considered.",28.260750823675522,11.306581594103948

However, efforts for development of an effective drug for prevention or control of WNV infection in human still remain unsuccessful. Some of the reasons include a low incidence of diseases, low commercial interest by pharmaceutical companies, high cost of mass vaccination, and diffi culties with running clinical trials due to unpredictable and sporadic nature of WNV outbreaks [ 363 , 364 ] . Another challenge for developing successful WNV therapeutics is to ensure safety and effi cacy in target populations that mostly include children, elderly, and immune-compromised individuals. Despite all these diffi culties, the quest for development of effective treatment and prevention methods against WNV infection are likely to be facilitated by recent technological advancement and should continue to meet the public health needs.

[25] [26] [27] [28] Research area investigators have conducted multiple studies focused on the response and effectiveness of vaccinations. Use of a selfadministered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (SNIF) was assessed in a phase IV, open-label randomized control trial involving 1077 subjects. Seroresponse between subjects who self-administered and those who had the vaccine administered by a healthcare profession did not differ. Prior to vaccine administration, there was no preference in method; however, at follow-up, 64% of subjects who selfadministered expressed a preference for that method. 29 Antibody response to the influenza vaccine among adults with HIV infections was also evaluated in one study and HIV-infected adults were less likely to generate a seroprotective response compared to adults without HIV infection. These findings indicate that despite receiving influenza vaccinations, adults with HIV infections may remain vulnerable to the disease. 30 Furthermore, the degree to which influenza vaccinations attenuate symptoms was assessed in another study involving 155 influenza-positive patients enrolled ARIC NHS (111 vaccinated). Patients who received a vaccination were significantly less likely to experience fever >-101°F or myalgias. When influenza species was considered, there was a significant reduction in symptoms among patients positive for Influenza A/H3N2 who received a vaccination; however, there was no difference in disease severity with vaccination status among patients positive for Influenza A/H1N1. 31 Annual immunization for influenza is mandatory for DoD personnel; however, the effectiveness of influenza vaccine has been shown to be suboptimal and warrants further investigation. Vaccine effectiveness is typically estimated using the test negative design, comparing proportions of influenza vaccination among patients with and without influenza. An analysis of influenza vaccine effectiveness conducted with ARIC NHS data in 2015 showed the vaccine effectiveness was below 35%. 32 The findings were consistent with those from the CDC and other sources, highlighting the poor effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine. These data also raise concerns that repeated immunization with seasonal influenza may increase susceptibility to influenza and severe illness. 33 In some influenza seasons, attack rates appear to be higher for people who were vaccinated during both the current and the prior year's influenza seasons compared to individuals who had only been vaccinated during the current season. Elucidating the relationship between repeated vaccinations and protection would have important implications for influenza vaccination policy. To date, the results from epidemiological studies have been conflicting. Nevertheless, examination of 155 influenza cases in the ARIC NHS (111 vaccinated) found that upper respiratory and overall symptoms were significantly less during the first two days of illness among vaccinated individuals. 31 The aim of the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Study is to explore the impact of repeated vaccination on influenza acquisition and severity in DoD populations based on a review of electronic medical records. Specifically, the study will assess the influence of antigenic components of the vaccine and the predominant influenza strain on vaccine effectiveness.

Herein, we summarize the research efforts of the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP) related to ARIs. Methods: The ARI Research Area of the IDCRP was established in response to the 2009 emergence of pandemic influenza A/H1N1. That year, IDCRP investigators deployed the ARI Consortium Natural History Study (ARIC NHS), a multi-centered, longitudinal observational study to assess etiology, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the U.S. military. The success of this initial effort spurred implementation of several new initiatives. These include the FluPlasma trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy of hyperimmune anti-influenza plasma for the treatment of severe influenza; the self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (SNIF) trial, which assessed the immunogenicity and acceptance of a self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine in military personnel; the Study to Address Threats of ARI in Congregate Military Populations (ATARI), a prospective study of ILI transmission, etiology and epidemiology in recruits; and the Flu Breath Test (FBT) study, a preliminary study of exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOC) in influenza patients. In addition, the InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) survey, a daily diary to measure influenza symptoms during clinical trials, was developed. Lastly, the Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the DoD (PAIVED) study, a two-year randomized trial designed to compare the effectiveness of the three types of licensed vaccines, launched in Fall 2018. Results: The on-going ARIC NHS has enrolled over 2000 ILI and SARI cases since its inception, providing data on burden and clinical manifestations of ARI in military personnel and their families. The FluPlasma 2 trial concluded subject enrollment in 2018. Preliminary results from ATARI study show a high frequency of respiratory viruses circulating during the first two weeks of recruit training. Based on assessment of FLU-PRO responses, which were found to be reliable and reproducible, the survey may be a useful tool in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. The Flu Breath Study will complete enrollment in 2019. Findings from PAIVED are intended to provide evidence needed for assessing influenza vaccination policy in the military. Conclusions: The ARI burden in the armed services remains significant every year and the threat is dynamic given emergent and evolving threats, such as influenzas. With strong successes to date, future initiatives of the ARI Research Area will focus on interventional studies, ARI transmission dynamics in congregate military settings, and determinants of risk of pandemic influenza and other emergent respiratory viruses.",16.66460955445293,5.233862454757225

Vaccine impact studies can use surveillance to demonstrate reduction of disease after introducing an intervention such as a vaccine. These impact studies require baseline data before the vaccine was introduced in order to compare the postvaccine era to the prevaccine introduction disease incidence. Special studies that gather additional information may complement surveillance disease trends.

Because of safety concerns, autopsies are rarely conducted on fatal human cases suspected to have died from a highly pathogenic viral agent. Further, the remote locations where cases typically occur limits the availability of sophisticated instruments required to thoroughly analyze specimens collected during the course of disease. In this regard, the disease course in NHPs is often better defined than the human condition which it is meant to model and therefore, much of our current understanding of pathogenesis for many high consequence viral pathogens has come from experimental infections of NHPs. On the basis of the similarity to humans, NHP models provide the best predicative value as to how a specific therapeutic or vaccine will work in humans.

A comparative study of different DNA vaccines identified Tc52 antigen as another therapeutic vaccine candidate, while DNA vaccines encoding antigens from the TS family previously found to be protective had no signifiacnt therapeutic effect [105] .

Deciphering the mechanisms of any disease requires a deep knowledge of how multiple and concurrent signal-transduction pathways operate and are deregulated. Inescapably, the intricacies of signaling pathways, which are often highly interconnected and temporally and spatially regulated, can be dissected only by systemlevel approaches. Coupled with compendium analysis, systems biology has the potential to discover novel pro-host therapeutic targets. By providing a more robust overview of the host cellular machinery and its response and interaction with a virus, these kinds of analyses offer inroads toward the development of innovative therapeutics that can act in concert with the host defense mechanism. Several notable case studies support the use of full systems-scale analyses in rational antiviral drug development. These can be categorized into three general areas: viral pathogenesis, functional identification of novel viral and host genes as drug targets, and prediction of antiviral drug response and patient stratification.",27.61720865874372,11.671915879528807

The most common pathogens include coxsackie virus (CV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, no antiviral agents with low toxicity and drug resistance are currently available in clinic therapy. The present study aimed to examine the antiviral activities of emodin (an ingredient of Rheum palmatum) against CVB 5 and RSV infections, in an attempt to discover new antiviral agents for virus infection. The monomer emodin was extracted and isolated from Rheum palmatum. The antiviral activities of emodin on HEp-2 cells were evaluated, including virus replication inhibition, virucidal and anti-absorption effects, by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and plaque reduction assay (PRA). The kinetics of virus inhibition by emodin in a period of 14 h was further determined by plaque assay and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Cytokine (IFN-γ, TNF-α) mRNA expressions after emodin treatment (7.5, 15, 30 μmol/L) were also assessed by qPCR post-infection. The results showed that emodin had potent inhibitory activities against CVB 5 and RSV, with the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) ranging from 13.06 to 14.27 μmol/L and selectivity index (SI) being 5.38-6.41 μmol/L. However, emodin couldn't directly inactivate the viruses or block their absorption to cells. It acted as a biological synthesis inhibitor against CVB 4 and RSV in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, especially during the first 0-4 h post-infection. Moreover, emodin could decrease the mRNA expression of IFN-α but enhance TNF-γ expression significantly compared to the viral controls in vitro. Our results provide a molecular basis for development of emodin as a novel and safe antiviral agent for human enterovirus and respiratory virus infection in the clinical therapy.",24.693736597754494,11.601814261774498

The susceptible strains of influenza A virus are commonly treated with adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. As the occurrence of genetic variations is highly substantial among influenza strains, resistance to either class of antiviral agents may develop quickly. However, the dosages of antiviral agents currently recommended for seasonal influenza are developed for fully susceptible strains and evaluated in clinical trials mandating the requirement of treatment within 3 days of the onset of symptoms. 65 Early antiviral treatment has been shown to provide maximal benefit, and treatment should not be delayed until confirmation of positive influenza test results. Negative results of influenza diagnostic tests, especially the rapid antigen tests, do not conclusively exclude influenza disease. Therefore, treatment after 48 h of symptomatic infection may still provide some clinical benefit to those with more severe disease. 61 The efficacy of ribavirin for the treatment of RSV CAP in infants is debatable, as certain in vitro studies have shown activity of ribavirin against RSV, but its usage for RSV infection is not routinely recommended in the management of lower respiratory tract disease because of the high cost, aerosol administration, and possible toxic effects among healthcare providers. Palivizumab (Synagis), a humanised murine monoclonal antibody is another effective prophylaxis for RSV infection that is administered intramuscularly. 66 Although parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and bocavirus are associated with pediatric CAP, there are no prospective, controlled studies for antiviral therapy against these viruses.",23.701618570872007,10.602004251456012

Indeed, deletion mutants of IAV have already been tested in live attenuated vaccines in Phase I/II clinical trial, resulting in enhanced IAV-specific antibody responses [85 ] .

Therefore, it is anticipated that CBAs will not interfere with the synthesis of glycans on cell-surface glycoproteins. The potential utility of lectins as antiviral agents seems promising. The antiviral potency of lectins against each virus may differ because their three-dimensional conformations differ, or because the availability of glycan conformations with the proper carbohydrate moieties differs across viral proteins. Several challenges must still be addressed, such as the high cost of the purification and mass production of lectins, their storage and stability, bioavailability, and cellular toxicity.

However, few vaccines for use in humans or specific antiviral therapeutics exist for several emerging/re-emerging viruses, including SARS, MERS-CoV, WNV, or BUNV. Thus, it is crucially important to understand the virus-host interactions that govern immunity, disease severity, and infection outcome. Recent findings have found that several viruses utilize multifaceted strategies to evade multiple arms of the innate immune response. Functionally pleiotropic suppressors such as IAV NS1 and EBOV VP35 reveal the complexity and level of sophistication by which these viral pathogens have developed as immune escape artists, but their nature as multifunctional antagonists also makes them attractive candidates in vaccines and therapeutics. For example, interventions that target IAV NS1 would suppress multiple IAV immunoevasion mechanisms, increasing the potential effectiveness of a candidate vaccine or therapy. Indeed, deletion mutants of IAV have already been tested in live attenuated vaccines in Phase I/II clinical trial, resulting in enhanced IAV-specific antibody responses [85] . With the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa, it is tempting to imagine that targeting the multifunctional EBOV VP35 may lead to the development of effective therapeutics and even a possible vaccine. Most importantly, studies aimed at expanding our understanding of viral evasion strategies undoubtedly reveal new insights into innate immune signaling and host antiviral defenses. Indeed, discovery of the RIG-I signaling pathway led to the identification of viral factors that antagonize RLR signaling. As viral pathogens continue to cause threat of global epidemics, improved understanding of host defenses will be crucial to limiting the burden of human disease.",21.801039081277686,8.40599409740347

The ability of the FMD virus (FMDV) to spread rapidly in susceptible animals has led to FMD being considered a disease serious enough to be listed by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) . FMDV belongs to the genus Aphthovirus in the family Picornaviridae (Bachrach, 1968) . The virus genome is an 8.5-kb, positive-sense single-stranded RNA containing one open reading frame. There are 7 serotypes: A, O, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3; moreover, numerous subtypes have evolved within each serotype (Knowles and Samuel, 2003; Domingo et al., 2003) . The use of current FMD vaccines to induce early protection is limited because protection cannot take effect until 7 days after the vaccination (Golde et al., 2005) . Therefore, an alternative method of applying antiviral agents is required to reduce the spread of FMDV in outbreak situations. Guanidine-hydrochloride (guanidine-HCl), ribavirin, interferon (IFN), and small interference RNA (siRNA) have been proposed as promising antiviral agents with different mechanisms. However, their inhibition effects on FMDV have not been evaluated although they have different antiviral efficiency.

The differences between the studies in different environments may be predominantly attributed to the absence of appropriate delivery systems for efficient transport of the therapeutic polysaccharides to the desired site. Thus, future studies should focus on the maximization of the therapeutic potentials of marine polysaccharides through the design of novel delivery systems that are highly compatible with the polysaccharides.

Yet, the evolutionary mechanisms available to viruses have successfully coped with many selective pressures, notably vaccines that do not evoke a broad immune response or treatment with antiviral agents. A common scenario with obvious commercial and sometimes even political influences is to test a new vaccine with an animal host, be it the authentic host or an animal model, and obtain full protection when the animal is challenged with a virus that matches the antigenic composition of the vaccine. Following the initial excitement, very often the vaccine displays only partial protection when tested in the natural environment. Somewhat parallel arguments can be made about clinical trials for antiviral agents, usually performed initially with selected groups of patients. This chapter has attempted to emphasize how the complexity of viral populations is a serious (often underestimated) difficulty to prevent and treat viral disease. Examination of the molecular mechanisms exploited by viruses to persist despite interventions suggests two major lines of action: first, a more judicious use of existing tools, that should consider the complexity of viral populations and their dynamics.

Although many other high mannose-binding lectins (such as legume family lectins) have been demonstrated to exhibit anti-HIVactivity (Balzarini et al. 2007 ), algal and cyanobacterial lectins are the most potent compounds reported thus far compared with other plant lectins, because they inhibit HIVentry into the host cells with EC 50 values in the picomolar to rnanomolar ange by directly binding to envelope gp120 compared with plant lectins which generally show a higher (micromolar) range of EC 50 values. These lectins also demonstrated powerful activity against HIV and influenza viruses regardless of different strains and subtypes. Effective antiviral agents are always in short supply because vaccine production is sometimes not on time, but there will be a high demand when there is an outbreak. The antiviral mechanism of the lectins is strain-independent. They may be more practical for medicinal use when compared with antibody-based antiviral agents that are prone to antigenic shift or antigenic drift. The substantial amount of carbohydrate residues on the virus envelope may be good targets for antibody treatment. However, some virus strains are continually changing their antigenicity by making an increased number of glycosylation sites in order to evade the antibody actions. As a result, it may be advantageous to use lectins as preventive drugs since they inactivate different virus strains and subtypes collectively.

Particular syndromes can be caused by a number of different viruses, and conversely, a particular virus can cause a number of different clinical syndromes. The viruses also have different epidemiologic patterns.

This multicountry network of populationbased surveillance sites provides a platform to test a variety of interventions in settings where ecology, economics, ethnicity, politics, predominant co-morbidities and co-infecting pathogens, and behavior vary, thereby providing a useful tool to design optimal intervention strategies targeted to each setting. GDD IEIP surveillance data also provides a stimulus for more urgent development of novel vaccines and therapeutics for RSV and other diseases by demonstrating their burden and severity and are poised to assess the effectiveness, acceptance, and value of these tools compared with other prevention strategies. Given the consistency in laboratory testing methods, the approach to surveillance of respiratory infections undertaken by GDD IEIP sites enables comparison of the burden of RSV disease and its epidemiology among the 6 geographically and sociopolitically diverse countries. Longitudinal surveillance data from these sites, combined with those from GDD Influenza Program sites, will add to the global understanding of RSV-associated mortality and risk factors for severe disease and death in low-and middleincome countries, result in better descriptions of RSV seasonality, and inform intervention strategies to mitigate the burden of RSV-associated disease. The IEIP-run surveillance sites are well positioned to serve as platforms for future RSV vaccine efficacy or effectiveness studies in low-and middle-income countries, and to evaluate the utility and feasibility of RSV prophylaxis in these settings. Ultimately, the evidence generated by studies from GDD IEIP surveillance sites can inform countries' determinations of their public health priorities and generate the political will to implement effective prevention and control measures, through evidence-based policy change.",21.080360123363725,9.15823077569073

Currently, there are no approved vaccines for RSV or HRV that could be used in such a study. However, the results of two nonrandomized studies of passive immunization to RSV in early life suggest that preventing severe RSV infection in infancy using monoclonal antibodies might reduce subsequent asthma. 25, 26 However, randomized and placebo-controlled study designs are needed to definitively answer this question. Similar studies with other respiratory viruses, such as HRV, await the development of safe and effective antivirals or vaccines. The high rates of exposure to these viruses early in life and the relative immaturity of the neonatal immune system will make effective vaccination difficult, and will require the development of novel vaccination strategies or technology. 27 Safe antiviral agents may eventually become as important as antibiotics in changing the microbiological landscape and associated respiratory morbidity. A variety of novel therapeutics, including inhibitors of attachment to host cells, viral protease inhibitors, and inhibitors of viral replication, are at various stages of development. 27 However, there are several challenges to this approach since the time between the onset of cold symptoms and deterioration of lung function can be short, and the development of viral resistance must be considered. For specific antiviral therapies to be implemented into clinical practice, it also may be necessary to develop accurate, affordable, and rapid viral diagnostics.

Notable recent examples that have had clinical trial success include a personalized therapeutic vaccine for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma assessed in a Phase I clinical trial [74] , IFN-α2b to combat hepatitis C assessed in a Phase IIa clinical trial (http://www.biolex.com), and human glucocerebrosidase to combat Gaucher disease, which has now progressed into a Phase III clinical trial [8] . These and similar purified protein products represent the current best options for making plant-based production systems for human vaccines and therapeutics a reality. In these cases, the emphasis is on demonstrating that the plant production systems can generate antigen or therapeutic protein of comparable safety potency and efficacy to other recombinant systems, without added concerns of an oral recombinant plant delivery vehicle. On a parallel track, a plant-produced vaccine candidate for Newcastle disease in chickens was approved for use in 2006. This again focused on a protein product purified from plant cells, and emphasizes that plant-produced targets can progress along the regulatory path.",26.520519923146857,9.586858838142655

Molecular modeling and virtual screening methods will play important roles in this task. An appreciated strategy is to identify drug candidates from the existing drugs according to the 3D model of A/ H1N1-NA by using virtual screening (e.g., molecular docking-and pharmacophore-based database search) in conjunction with bioassay. This strategy has been used to successfully discover the anti-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) compound cinanserin [15] .

Individuals who have recovered from a viral infection, or who have received a therapeutic vaccination, contain a population of antibodies that is capable of contributing to a life-long immunity from the virus. These are defined as ""native antibodies,"" i.e., antibodies in exactly the configurations created by a functioning, intact human immune system. Native antibodies are most commonly obtained by methods that immortalize primary B cells by hybridoma formation or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. They are distinct from human or humanized antibodies derived from recombinant DNA or transgenic mouse systems, which may not accurately replicate the complete, wild-type structure of full-length antibodies produced by the human immune system in situ. The native human antibody repertoire has tremendous potential as a source for antiviral antibody therapeutics because it contains definitive immunologic solutions to human viral diseases and is likely to be the safest overall for human clinical use. Polyclonal antibody therapeutics of unselected and disease-specific native immunoglobulins are effective in some clinical situations. These intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are the starting point for exploring the potential value of the native human antibody immunome, but they do not address the vast spectrum of viral diseases for which antibodies have potential therapeutic efficacy.

Quantitative plasma PCR testing (PCR viral load) is increasingly used for diagnosis and monitoring of CMV viremia in renal transplant recipients. Antiviral agents that have been shown to be effective against CMV include ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. Ganciclovir remains the drug of choice for treating established disease. Intravenous ganciclovir therapy is preferred in children because of the erratic absorption of oral ganciclovir. Major limitations of ganciclovir therapy are the induction of renal tubular dysfunction and bone marrow toxicity, principally neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Dosage adjustments are necessary for recipients with renal dysfunction. Oral valganciclovir is now used for CMV prophylaxis post-transplant (152) . Use of other antiviral agents such as foscarnet and cidofovir is limited because of nephrotoxicity and difficulty of administration.

Antivirals could only be of therapeutic value in those infections where symptoms and pathological changes develop in the presence of viral replication. However, prophylactic treatment of contacts is another potentially important indication for some infections. The clinical importance of a virus infection can be assessed according to rates of mortality, morbidity and the frequency of long-term sequelae. Thus, for example, the fatal outcomes associated with clinical rabies and herpes encephalitis confer on these infections an importance different from those of rhinoviruses. Prevalence of infection is highly variable and dependent on many factors, including population density and immune status, genetic susceptibility, geographical location, sanitation, virus virulence, and medical management of cases, with particular reference to quarantine and other procedures which prevent transmission.

This side effect is usually associated with oral dosing and can be largely avoided by alternative route of administration. Alternatively, development of iminosugar prodrugs, which involves converting the prodrugs into biologically active drugs within the circulation or intracellular compartment, should also reduce this ""off-target"" effect.However, the major concern on host-targeting antiviral therapy is the side effects due to ""on-target"" suppression of host function. Although studies in animal models and human clinical trails have suggested that iminosugar glucosidase inhibitors are generally well tolerated in mice and humans, at least for short term administrations [15] [16] [17] , the tragic clinical presentations of CDG-IIb patients clearly indicate that long-term suppression of ER glucosidases I and/or II with more potent inhibitors may cause significant side-effects, particularly in nerve and immune systems. Moreover, unlike chronic viral infections where long-term and potent suppression of viral replication is required for achieving a beneficial clinical efficacy, suppression of viremia by merely 1 to 2 logs in the early phase of an acute infection, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, has been demonstrated to be life-saving [18, 19] . Hence, treatment of chronic viral infections with ER glucosidase inhibitors may not be a good choice, due to the potential side effects as well as the availability of potent directacting antiviral drugs in clinics. However, the broad spectrum antiviral activity, antiinflammatory potential as well as great in vivo tolerability for short term administrations make ER glucosidase inhibitors the ideal antiviral agents for acute viral diseases, particularly for treatment of viral hemorrhagic fever and severe respiratory tract viral infections. While viral hemorrhagic fevers can be caused by many viruses from four different families, including flaviviruses, buyaviruses, arenaviruses and filoviruses, server respiratory tract viral infections can also be caused by multiple viruses from three distinct families, including influenza A viruses, several paramyoxiviruses and coronaviruses. Furthermore, influenza A viruses are featured by seasoning variations and frequent introduction of avain-derived species. Those etiological features make development of viral specific antiviral agents to treat these diseases a daunting task. Clinically, either hemorrhagic fevers or server acute respiratory syndromes caused by different viruses are symptomatically similar, sometime life-threatening and have short time windows for therapeutic intervention [20] . These clinical characteristics also do not favor therapies with virus-specific antiviral agents relying on time-consuming etiological diagnoses. In contrast, broad-spectrum antiviral agents will perfectly meet the clinical needs. Fortunately, all the viruses causing the two clinical syndromes are sensitive to ER glucosidase inhibitors and thus potentially efficacious.",22.42716724544288,9.719828635497217

These studies served to demonstrate ""proof of concept"" of the vaccine early in clinical development (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite challenge of malaria-naïve U.S. volunteers previously administered a candidate malaria vaccine). Human challenge studies may also be considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the vaccine. For example, the Agency convened the Vaccines and Related Biologics Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) to consider whether data from human challenge studies in U.S. subjects could be sufficient to demonstrate efficacy of a cholera vaccine in travelers to endemic areas who are at high risk for contracting the disease. In 1998, the VRBPAC agreed that human challenge studies could suffice to demonstrate efficacy of a cholera vaccine provided that studies were adequate and well-controlled and conducted under the provisions of good clinical practices. 21 In 2016, the FDA approved Vaxchora, a live, attenuated vaccine for the prevention of cholera in adults traveling to cholera-affected areas.

The dogs were not randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups and the shelter staff was not formally blinded to the vaccines given. However, there were no significant differences in host or environmental characteristics at baseline among dogs in the three vaccine groups (Table 1) . Although viral and bacterial cultures were performed at the start and near the conclusion of the trial, the pattern of pathogens in the shelter was not monitored throughout the trial. Some upper-respiratory signs of disease might, therefore, have been caused by pathogens for which antigens were not present in the vaccine. The finding of B. bronchiseptica before the study started confirmed that this organism was present, and at least in part responsible for the rate of coughing reported to us. The finding of canine-adenovirus months later suggests that at least in this shelter at this time, this pathogen might have contributed to clinical disease and argues in favor of trivalent vaccine use. Staff members were not blinded to the vaccines given the dogs. Because this study was not funded and used commercially packaged vaccines (each of which had a distinct appearance and delivery system), the simplest procedure was rotating-day assignment. Owners could discover the name of the manufacturer of the vaccines given to their dogs within the adoption paperwork. It is possible that the lack of blinding contributed to the small differences seen in this study. For example, if there had been an expectation that the experimental vaccine would be effective, then the increased coughing incidence in the IN-P group might actually have been under-reported-leading to decreased effectiveness for the active vaccines. On the other hand, potential misclassification of coughing might have resulted in either under-or over-reporting of coughing in the other vaccine groups, again making it difficult to discern true incidence (Rothman and Greenland, 1998) . Ideally, vaccines would have been packaged identically with no distinguishing characteristics and with a coding scheme for their identification.

One proposed mechanism involves activation of the innate immune response following influenza infection, leading to a temporary reduction in the risk of infection with a different respiratory virus. By reducing the risk of influenza infection, the influenza vaccine could paradoxically create an increased risk of infection with other noninfluenza respiratory viruses. If this phenomenon occurs, it could lead to biased estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness in studies using laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and influenza-negative controls. In this scenario, the risk of noninfluenza viral illness would be higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals, and an 'influenza-negative' control group would therefore have a higher proportion of vaccinated individuals compared to the source population. This could theoretically contribute to overestimation of true VE (ie, bias away from the null); therefore, a key assumption of the test-negative control design of influenza vaccine effectiveness studies is that the proportion of noninfluenza viral illness does not differ by influenza vaccination status [9] .",23.493149476985742,8.370598276912384

Other active siRNA sequences inhibiting SCV have also been reported from screening only a handful of candidate open reading frames in cell culture with either synthetic siRNA (30-32) or plasmidexpressed shRNA (33).

The best location to provide a randomized controlled trail was thought to be the intensive care units for the use of convalescent sera; the presence of milder disease may necessitate the development of therapeutic protocols for patients with severe and those with milder disease. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies may offer further therapeutic options for the disease in humans. Since the prospect for a randomized clinical trial is low due to the sporadic nature of the disease outside hospital outbreaks, it is prudent to have well-conducted prospective clinical studies. The proteins involved in MERS-CoV entry and replication are attractive targets for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Clinical studies utilizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies as therapeutic options would add to the prospect to develop therapeutic agents for this syndrome. Although many drugs appear to be effective in vitro, a consideration of their availability, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, and side effects should be taken into consideration. Of medications with an attractive use, lopinavir, interferon, and mycophenolate are among these agents. Accelerated and preferably randomized controlled trails should be conducted. Neutralizing antibodies are also promising and the use of these agents in humans. Targeting the DDP4 receptor may be of particular importance; however, it is important to keep in mind that the development of any mutation in the binding sites may limit the use of these agents [74] . Few monoclonal antibodies showed protective efficacy as a prophylaxis in animal models [39, 48] .

Thus the potent and specific properties of siRNA that are controlled solely by changes to their sequence suggest that their combinations will be easily managed. Kim et al.

The patient had not received the yellow fever vaccine. The patient was positive for yellow fever virus by PCR detection and rapidly progressed to acute liver failure with acute renal failure and coma. Dr. Jacobs described the epidemiology and natural history of yellow fever virus infection. Yellow fever is classically described as having two phases, characterized by an initial viremia associated with an acute febrile illness that lasts for up to 6 days followed by a remission of 2-24 h. Following this brief remission, there is a period of intoxication that lasts 3-8 days with symptoms that include gastroinestional disturbances, liver involvement (jaundice) and increasingly severe clinical presentation leading to death in 30-60% of patients.

To achieve this, an ideal disease model should faithfully reproduce all the hallmarks of the human condition as closely as possible in an immunocompetent animal following a realistic challenge dose via an appropriate exposure route. In addition to these conditions the Animal Rule stipulates that in vivo models must be based on a challenge virus that is a wild-type etiological agent of human disease. In general, non-human primates (NHPs, including Cynomolgus and Rhesus macaques, African Green Monkeys and Marmosets) fulfill the criteria of the FDA Animal Rule for most highly pathogenic viruses, making them the goldstandard for studying pathogenesis and evaluating potential medical countermeasures, although it should be noted that not all NHP species are equally susceptible to all agents. Logistically working with NHPs is far more labor intensive than working with rodents, however frequently NHP models are the best characterized model for this group of pathogens, due in large part to a wealth of commercially available reagents. In general, the pathogenesis of emerging viral diseases in humans is poorly defined and not well understood. Due to safety concerns, autopsies are rarely conducted on fatal human cases suspected to have died from a highly pathogenic viral agent. Further, the remote locations where cases typically occurs limits the availability of sophisticated instruments required to thoroughly analyze specimens collected during the course of disease. In this regard, the disease course in NHPs is often better defined than the human condition which it is meant to model and therefore, much of our current understanding of pathogenesis for many high consequence viral pathogens has come from experimental infections of NHPs. Based on the similarity to humans, NHP models provide the best predicative value as to how a specific therapeutic or vaccine will work in humans. However, it should be noted that even when a vaccine or therapeutic is thoroughly evaluated in NHP models, there is still uncertainty regarding its efficacy in humans since for this group of agents no human vaccines or therapeutics have been thoroughly evaluated in humans.",22.21820511327131,10.230269462536574

A number of excellent reviews have been published covering different aspects of picornavirology (Putnak and Phillips, 1981; Koch and Koch, 1985; Carrasco and Castrillo, 1987; Rossmann and Johnson, 1989; Sonenberg, 1990; Palmenberg, 1990; Stanway, 1990; Racaniello, 1990; Lawson and Semler, 1990; Richards and Ehrenfeld, 1990; Minor, 1990; Sarnow et al., 1990; Minor, 1992; Kirkegaard, 1992; Agol, 1993; Harber and Wimmer, 1993) . Picornaviruses are structurally simple and appear as spherical particles of -,~ 30 nm diameter that possess icosahedral symmetry. The genome is a molecule of single-stranded RNA of positive polarity. This family was first divided into four genera: Enterovirus, Cardiovirus, Rhinovirus and Aphtovirus. More recently, an additional genus, Hepatovirus, has been recognized on the basis of genome sequence and organization (Fig. 1) . Some members of this group are of great importance in medicine and veterinary science, because they are pathogens of humans or of animals and, hence, of economic or ecological interest. Examples include poliovirus, the causative agent of poliomyelitis, coxsackie virus, a factor responsible for causing heart disease, and echo viruses that cause meningitis in humans, all three belonging to the Enterovirus genus. The main causative agents of common colds are rhinoviruses (genus Rhinovirus). Hepatitis A, a virus that causes hepatitis, was previously classified in the Enterovirus genus, but is now included in the Hepatovirus genus (Stanway, 1990; Harber and Wimmer, 1993) . Finally, the infective agent for one of the most threatening afflictions of cattle, foot-and-mouth disease, is a member of the Aphtovirus genus. Although effective vaccines have been developed for some of these viruses, such as poliovirus or hepatitis A virus, the development of vaccines for other members of this group, such as rhinoviruses, has yet to be achieved Murdin et al., 1990; Minor, 1990 Minor, , 1992 . Thus, it is important to develop antiviral agents to combat disease. Apart from the use of antiviral agents in this respect, these compounds play a pivotal role in molecular virology. Indeed, antiviral agents are very useful for elucidating numerous viral processes, if we can identify the exact target of the agent at the molecular level. In addition, antiviral agents provide clean and accurate tools that aid in the dissection of the complicated molecular steps of viral genome replication. Hence, antiviral agents are to molecular virology what other inhibitors are to molecular biology. Picornavirus inhibitors represent good examples of compounds that are not only useful in providing a better understanding of the biology of picornaviruses, but also in furnishing promising agents that are being assayed in clinical trials against the common cold, for instance. The large number of compounds now available for the selective blockade of different steps of the picornavirus replication cycle makes these agents invaluable tools for picornavirologists, but it is difficult to organize a comprehensive review covering all of them. Although I have tried to include as many examples as possible of the approaches used and the agents employed, inevitably, coverage will be incomplete. I apologise in advance to those whose work is not included, despite its merits.",22.620452237531815,8.407109803363031

Since all age groups are affected and a high fatality is noted in the elderly and those with co-morbidities (Donnelly et al., 2003) , there is an urgent need to find a cure. Prospective clinical and viral load studies in nasopharyngeal secretions from SARS patients showed that viral replication peaked at the 10th day after the onset of symptoms with subsequent clinical deterioration in 30% of the cases despite a decreasing viral load (Peiris et al., 2003) . Therefore the key facet of management should include respiratory support, immuno-modulation in selected cases and early institution of an effective antiviral agent. Such an antiviral agent, if given early, may decrease the peak viral load and the associated immuno-dysregulatory damage. At the moment, there are no commercially available antiviral agents tailored-made for SARS coronavirus. There is an urgent need to search for an agent with a known in use clinical and toxicity profile so that a randomised placebo control trial can be conducted if the epidemic recurs in one of the coming winters.

Generally, virus-targeting antivirals functionally inhibit the biological process of viral proteins, mostly enzymatic activities. Alternatively, they may block viral proteinprotein interactions (PPI) that are essential for the virus replication machinery (Lou et al., 2014) . Host-targeting antivirals inspect the host-virus battleground and focus on the cellular factors that are involved in the viral life cycle or host immune response. It is believed to be a more sophisticated strategy since they minimize the emergence of drug resistance (Watanabe and Kawaoka, 2015) .

This type of study recruits subjects who have influenza-like illness, collects a respiratory specimen, performs diagnostic laboratory testing to determine the pathogen, and obtains the individual's vaccination status [18] [19] [20] [21] . The vaccine-associated virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study, that is, vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness. The results of this study do not support a potential for bias in test-negative influenza vaccine effectiveness studies. In a test-negative study design, patients must be sick with influenza-like illness. Since the population must be ill, if the vaccinated population is more likely to have other respiratory viruses when compared to the non-vaccinated population, then in turn they are less likely to have influenza. Bias introduced in these studies may cause an overestimate of vaccine effectiveness. Mandatory influenza vaccination is required for all Active Duty personnel [13] . As such, vaccination effectiveness studies examining strictly Active Duty military members have previously shown to be methodologically invalid and often times have uninterpretable results [22, 23] . In order to examine potential issues with mandatory vaccination, beneficiary category was included in the logistic regression model. While beneficiary category did not remain significant, and was therefore not kept in the final logistic model, Active Duty members were then separated from the rest of the population and virus interference among this population was calculated. Both the unadjusted and adjusted models did not show significant evidence of virus interference in Active Duty members; therefore, this large portion of the population does not appear to be skewing study results converse to the aforementioned vaccine effectiveness studies.",27.834775220199052,11.415008456304935

Despite many advances, IAVs are still a challenge for the scientists. IAVs are highly contagious and causative agents of seasonal flu epidemics resulting in morbidity, mortality and huge economic losses. Based on the circulating strains, seasonal influenza vaccines are developed annually or biannually, if needed, by WHO but the immunity provided is short-lived due to continuous change in the virus strains. Therefore, vaccination is usually required every year to be protected from seasonal flu that leads to increase in vaccine cost along with shortage of vaccines in developing countries. But the two main problems with vaccination are the time required to select, manufacture and deliver vaccine and the variable annual immunization rates (Couch, 2008) . Besides vaccination, the antiviral agents are the therapeutic options to treat the infection. Antivirals against M2 protein and neuraminidase are available but their irrational use has led to the emergence of resistant strains (Agrawal et al., 2010; Hayden and Hay, 1992; Poland et al., 2009) . Thus, there is a continued requirement of new antiviral agents against IAV.",25.623566252796017,11.036638951284544

However, although patterns change yearly, 99% of reported influenza cases in the 1999 -2000 season were from influenza A. Although it would seem that these agents would hold great promise for the treatment of a primarily viral illness, their usefulness in the treatment of acute bronchitis is hindered severely by their weak efficacy against influenza in general. Also, these drugs are relatively expensive and, historically, physicians have been poor at accurately predicting the presence of influenza, even at the height of a seasonal epidemic. 15 These agents have been shown to decrease the duration of influenza symptoms by about 1 day, but only if the treatment is initiated within the first 48 hours of the symptomatic period. 15, 16 However, because of problems with cost, poor efficacy, and difficulties with accurate diagnosis of influenza, these agents cannot be recommended for routine treatment of acute bronchitis.",22.262828412169625,11.010097310821259

Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT PCR) can detect viral mRNA transcripts in peripheral blood but is less sensitive than pp65 or PCR [117] . Immune histocytochemistry is used for diagnosing end-organ disease. Quantitative plasma PCR testing (PCR viral load) is increasingly used for diagnosis and monitoring of CMV viremia in renal transplant recipients [117] . The American Society of Transplantation (AST) recommends monitoring for CMV by quantitative viral load monthly for the first year after transplantation, and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommends an additional 3 monthly surveillance for the second year. Antiviral agents that have been shown to be effective against CMV include ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. Ganciclovir remains the drug of choice for treating established disease. Intravenous ganciclovir therapy is preferred in children because of the erratic absorption of oral ganciclovir. Major limitations of ganciclovir therapy are the induction of renal tubular dysfunction and bone marrow toxicity, principally neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Dosage adjustments are necessary for recipients with renal dysfunction. Oral valganciclovir is recommended for CMV prophylaxis posttransplant [118] . Duration of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on the serostatus of the donor and recipient [115] . While it is effective in reducing the incidence of symptomatic CMV, prospective viral surveillance studies have shown subclinical infection in 12-22 % of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, hence the importance of viral surveillance [115] . Use of other antiviral agents such as foscarnet and cidofovir is limited because of nephrotoxicity and difficulty of administration.

Immunological therapies, including therapeutic vaccines, are needed to complement drug therapy in the search for a ""functional cure"" for HIV. DermaVir (Genetic Immunity Kit, Budapest, Hungary and McLean, Virginia, USA), an experimental HIV/AIDS therapeutic vaccine, combines three key elements of a rational therapeutic vaccine design: a single pDNA immunogen expressing 15 HIV Ags, a synthetic pDNA nanomedicine formulation, and a DC-targeting topical vaccine administration. DermaVir alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs was evaluated in chronically SIV-infected macaques. DermaVir provided virological, immunological, and clinical benefit for SIV-infected macaques during chronic HIV infection and AIDS. In combination with antiretroviral drugs, DermaVir augmented SIV-specific T-cell responses and enhanced control of viral load rebound during treatment delays. The data also indicated the feasibility of therapeutic immunization even in immunecompromised hosts and suggested that DermaVir can supplement antiretroviral drugs to sustain suppression of HIV-1 replication (Lisziewicz et al. 2005 ). DermaVir's novel mechanism of action involves vaccine transportation by epidermal Langerhans cells to the lymph nodes to express the pDNA-encoded HIV Ags and induce precursor/memory T cells with high proliferation capacity. This effect has been consistently demonstrated in mouse, rabbit, primate, and human subjects. Safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of DermaVir have been clinically observed in HIV-infected human subjects.

A therapeutic HIV vaccine could induce this type of response and would invariably decrease contagiousness, the need for costly and potentially dangerous antiretroviral treatments, and the number of opportunistic infections in patients. While the effect of controlling the normal HIV-1 pathology with therapeutic vaccines would be favorable for individual patients as well as society at large, the effect of preventing HIV-1 infections in humans with a prophylactic vaccine is also broadly appealing and of the utmost importance (Beena et al. 2013) . Therapeutic HIV vaccines are designed specifically for HIV-positive individuals, who have an uncompromised immune system that is capable of generating effective anti-HIV immune responses. Therefore, clinical trials for therapeutic vaccines are recruiting volunteers with CD4 + T-cell counts greater than 250 cells/ mm 3 , and most studies require a CD4 + T-cell count greater than 350 cells/mm 3 . Patients with compromised immune system may be unable to produce a good immune response to a therapeutic HIV vaccine and are therefore not eligible for these trials.

With the current lack of effective antiviral strategies, there has been an intense focus in vaccine development as well as antiviral drug discovery. Recent progress in both these fronts is encouraging. An immunogenic VLP-based candidate vaccine is in phase-II clinical trials and other candidate vaccines based on P domain, which elicit strong immune responses, also hold promise. These studies raise the possibility of designing multivalent vaccines to counter the antigenic and genetic diversity exhibited by HuNoVs. Recent progress in the isolation and characterization of HBGAblocking human mAbs points to a distinct possibility of designing antibody-based scaffolds as immunotherapeutic agents. In parallel, several studies have focused on selected nonstructural proteins such as protease and RdRp for small molecule drug discovery. Further studies are required to optimize their metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic properties. Progress made in recent years in producing human NoVs in cultured cells [96**,97**] may prove critical for robust optimization of such antiviral drugs and lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie virus replication, which in turn may pave way for discovering novel antiviral agents. Combined use of antivirals with an effective vaccine may indeed be realized in the near future to counter and control HuNoV infections. ",23.874794395722773,8.89705150642518

Currently there are no licensed therapeutic intervention measures either in terms of vaccines or drugs available for these highly contagious human pathogens. Genetic and antigenic diversity of these viruses, rapid emergence of new strains, and their ability to infect a broad population by using polymorphic histo-blood group antigens for cell attachment, pose significant challenges for the development of effective antiviral agents. Despite these impediments, there is progress in the design and development of therapeutic agents. These include capsid-based candidate vaccines, and potential antivirals either in the form of glycomimetics or designer antibodies that block HBGA binding, as well as those that target essential non-structural proteins such as the viral protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Studies in animal models of MS suggest that interleukin(IL)-17-secreting CD4 and γδ T cells may drive CNS autoimmunity, especially with regard to access to CNS parenchyma from perivascular spaces [66] . γδ T cells, which do not require antigen processing and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation of peptide epitopes and instead may recognize lipid antigens, are also sources of IL-1 within the inflamed CNS [67, 68] . CXCR7 reporter mice exhibit expression of the receptor along postcapillary venules, which is increased during induction of CNS autoimmune disease, leading to loss of abluminal expression of CXCL12 and increased CNS access of myelinspecific T cells [31] . In vivo targeting of CXCR7 in animal studies using small molecule inhibitors maintains polarized expression of CXCL12 and limits the egress of immune cells out of perivascular spaces during induction of EAE. In vitro studies examining the regulation of CXCR7 expression on BMECs demonstrated that IL-17 and IL-1 increase the expression and activity of the receptor, respectively, consistent with in vivo studies demonstrating roles for these cytokines in driving neuropathology and the clinical effectiveness of therapies that target IL-17 or IL-1 in patients with autoimmune diseases [69] [70] [71] .

Similar collections of FDA-approved drugs have proven to be rich sources of undiscovered bioactivity and therapeutic potential. We identified itraconazole (ITZ) as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of enterovirus replication. ITZ is a well-known antifungal drug that inhibits CYP51, a cytochrome P450 required for sterol biosynthesis (Lestner and Hope, 2013). In addition, ITZ exerts anti-cancer activity by inhibiting angiogenesis – through disturbing mTOR signaling and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) trafficking – and the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway (Kim et al., 2010; Nacev et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2010). ITZ has been found to be efficacious in patients with several cancer types in multiple Phase 2 clinical studies (Antonarakis et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014; Rudin et al., 2013). We demonstrate that known targets of ITZ cannot explain the antiviral activity of ITZ. Instead, evidence is presented that OSBP and ORP4 are novel targets of ITZ and that direct binding of ITZ to OSBP – which localizes at ROs – disrupts its lipid shuttling function and accounts for the antiviral effect of ITZ.",10.516218805909539,5.813917037457361

The range of viruses carried unnoticed by our phylogenetic next of kin may be huge. For instance, wild small mammals including bats and rodents have now been shown to harbor a tremendous spectrum of relatives of human paramyxoviruses—a family that contains the mumps virus, several different respiratory agents and the measles virus.4 Not all of these have yet been proven to have their cognates in bats, but the sample studied so far is just a tiny fraction of the tremendous bat diversity. Some of these agents have already been suggested to cross-infect humans.5 That is a worrying perspective because the concept of liberating humankind from some of its most notorious viruses by mass vaccination is essentially dependent on the absence of animal sources from which eradicated viruses could be replenished.6 The implications of recent findings might even reach into the future agenda of virus eradication: the hepatitis C virus, one of the most important human viruses and a prime candidate for eradication pending vaccine availability, has relatives in companion animals including dogs and horses.7,8",11.776381844420355,4.834097295451852

Scientists at the Peking Vaccine and Serum Institute in China also carried out clinical trials using live vaccines during the same time period (1). Additionally, there are records of the mass production of a live H1N1 vaccine in Odessa, USSR, in 1977 (14, 15). In the early days of research in the 1940s, LAIVs were often able to regain virulence upon administration to humans and cause disease (16). In addition, many strains isolated from the 1977 outbreak (for example, the A/Tientsin/78/77 isolate) were temperature sensitive (ts), meaning that the virus could not replicate at higher temperatures. Temperature sensitivity generally occurs only after a series of laboratory manipulations, typical in generation of LAIVs, and is used as a biological marker of attenuation. While not all of the 1977-1978 strains were temperature sensitive, a comparison of all 1977 strains shows a higher prevalence of the ts phenotype than in 1950 strains, supporting the claim that the outbreak may have resulted from attempts at attenuation for vaccine purposes (1, 17). The possibility that the 1977-1978 strain could have resulted from a LAIV trial was also mentioned in a personal communication from C. M. Chu, renowned virologist and the former director of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences to Peter Palese, who described “the introduction of this 1977 virus [as] the result of vaccine trials in the Far East involving the challenge of several thousand military recruits with live H1N1 virus” (18).

Therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed to limit lung damage and interference with lung repair are important. Lungs are exposed to mechanical load during every breath.

This is especially relevant during mechanical ventilation with high pressures, which can lead to the so-called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (3, 4) .

From a scientific point of view, there are two course of actions that can be followed. On the one hand, new vaccines and pharmaceutical interventions need to be developed. This usually requires months of work. Therefore, on the other hand, it is important to study the large-scale spatial spreading of the disease through mathematical and computational modeling, which allows evaluating ""in-silicon"" what-if-scenarios and potential contention measures to stop or delay the disease. This modeling effort is key, as it can contribute to maximize the effectiveness of any protection measures and gain time to develop new drugs or a vaccine to protect the population.

We use a previous framework for the study of epidemics in structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to recurrent mobility patterns [7, 17, 10, 18] .To understand the geographical diffusion of the disease, as a result of human-human interactions in small geographical patches, one has to combine the contagion process with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. For the case of epidemic modeling, the metapopulation scenario is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, being the size (number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well-mixed, i.e., pathogens can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The second aspect of our metapopulation model concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. Mobility of agents between different patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the possibility of moving between them.",10.928977598287418,4.776617010770454

Testing protocols and diagnostic tools changed during the early period of the study 23 , and the number of diagnosed cases collected before 15 th January were considered underestimated and less reliable. This would flatten the epidemic curve in early studies, and the estimation of R0 based on these data may be underestimated and have larger confidence intervals. Second, previous studies only estimated the R0 based on a single method, and these estimates may have been affected by the implicit assumptions in these models. For example, a previous paper using the assumption of exponential growth found a value of "" of 2.68 (95% Credible interval 2.47 -2.86) 5 using an SEIR model with Metropolis-Hastings MCMC estimates of uncertainty, but our modeling has shown that this method likely underestimated the basic reproduction number during the pre-closure period.
