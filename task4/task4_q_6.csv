Intrinsic fitness effects are considered here to be those that stem from the intracellular processes of viral gene expression and assembly, independent of host immune responses. Intrinsic fitness differences between the vaccine and the revertant (wild-type vector) are plausible because the transgene is non-essential and has no evolutionary history with the vector genome. Thus, the insertion may be disruptive, and the resulting antigen expression may interfere with vector functions. Intrinsic fitness effects are expected to affect evolution during vaccine manufacture as well as within-host evolution, but it has largely been investigated in vitro, as would apply to manufacture and the pre-host phase. Indeed, intrinsic fitness differences may be the sole or at least the most important bases of vaccine inferiority. Because recombinant viruses have often been observed to evolve loss or down-regulation of engineered inserts, they are now commonly observed during in vitro growth for their 'genetic stability' (e.g., [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] ). Some recombinant viral genomes are stable over short term transfers in culture, others not, indicating that intrinsic fitness effects of the engineering are not universal. Thus, the possibility of vaccine inferiority should not be ignored, and furthermore, even when a vaccine appears to be stable over a few transfers, the short term population where the revertant has a 10% fitness advantage and starts at a frequency of 10 −6 . The curve shows the well-known population genetic principle that, while the favored type (revertant) is rare, its absolute frequency changes very little. But the frequency eventually reaches a level at which evolution is rapid. The yellow box represents a possible period of pre-host evolution, the green box representing the period of within-host evolution. The periods of within-host evolution are drawn to be the same length in right and left panels, as if the vaccine has the same within-host duration in both cases. The arrow represents a possible point at which manufacture would end and an inoculum be created, thus defining the boundary between pre-host and within-host evolution. The left panel depicts a short period of vaccine manufacture, the right a longer period of vaccine manufacture and one in which more pre-host evolution has occurred. It is thus easy to see the potential importance of pre-host vaccine evolution on within-host evolution, for even when the revertant is not a large component of the inoculum, it can be poised for rapid evolution within the host (right panel). The curve obeys p t ¼ p 0 w t p 0 w t þ1À p 0 , in which p t represents the revertant frequency in generation t and w the fitness of revertant relative to vaccine. The curve is drawn for a common evolutionary process across pre-host and within-host evolution, but evolution in the within-host phase will typically experience different parameters than evolution in the pre-host phase. retention of antigen expression may mask an underlying long term instability. Thus most observations of stability merely set limits on the possible magnitudes of inferiority. Yet even if vaccine selective 'neutrality' turns out to be fleeting, merely a mistaken impression from shortterm observations, we will find that the phenomenon of short-term stability mirrors a solution to minimize vaccine evolution within the host-the solution of limiting vaccine growth.",9.959065904104081,8.791023703872341

China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and Viet Nam, 2003) . Accordingly, initial laboratory efforts towards the identification of the responsible agent were focused on a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and available epidemiologic information. Evidence collected so far (Preliminary clinical description of severe acute respiratory syndrome, 2003) indicates that SARS has an incubation period spanning from 1 to 11 days and the major mode of transmission is through droplet spread, although airborne transmission or a role for contaminated objects cannot be ruled out at the present time. It is accepted that patients are highly infectious during the symptomatic phase of SARS. It is not clear, at present, whether the infectious state is also present in pre-symptomatic stages and/or during recovery. However, a list of hygienic measures that should be implemented has been described by the CDC (Table I) . There is also no current information about the potential for an asymptomatic carrier state. There have been extraordinary efforts already made to identify the agent, obtain viral nucleotide sequence, establish methods to culture and grow the potential agent, develop a reliable ELISA assay, establish RT-PCR conditions, etc.; all made possible by well co-ordinated studies of scientists throughout the world. This degree of co-coperation/sharing of data is a monumental accomplishment by the scientific community and should be applauded. Within this context, unlike HIV where the formulation of an effective candidate vaccine has been a daunting task, it is reasonable to assume that a candidate vaccine for the coronavirus agent responsible for SARS will be a reality in the relatively near future. This is likely because, unlike HIV, a large number of individuals who get infected with SARS, recover from the infection, and appear to become healthy and normal. This evidence suggests that the body's immune system is capable of containing the virus. Thus, it seems reasonable that a safe and effective vaccine in the form of a live attenuated, recombinant, or killed vaccine may become a reality.",12.00779132963926,6.212366186803566

However, few of the advances made in developing vaccines and therapeutics for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could be exploited for the countering 2019-nCoV. But since the efforts to design and develop any vaccine or antiviral agent to tackle the presently emerging coronavirus pathogen would take some time, therefore till then we need to rely extensively on enforcing highly effective prevention and control measures to minimize the risk of 2019-nCoV transmission and spread to the best feasible extent (Cheng et al. 2020) . Majority of the vaccines that are being developed for coronaviruses targets the Spike glycoprotein or S protein (Graham et al. 2013) . This is mainly because of the fact that S protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies (Jiang et al. 2005) . Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Among them, the S protein-based vaccines include full-length S protein vaccines, viral vector-based vaccine, DNA-based vaccine, recombinant S proteinbased and recombinant RBD protein-based vaccines. Whereas S protein based antiviral therapies include RBD-ACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs (Du et al. 2009 ). Even though such therapeutic options have proven efficacy in the in vitro studies, however most of these haven't undergone randomized animal or human trials and hence are of limited use in our present 2019-nCoV scenario. Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was intended to be used for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. It also has anti-coronavirus activity due to its inhibitory action on the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication (Sheahan et al. 2017) . At present, efforts are being made to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against 2019-nCoV. Combination therapy with 2019-nCoV specific monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir can be considered as the ideal therapeutic option for 2019-nCoV (Cohen 2020) . Further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy. A variety of different therapeutic and vaccine designing approaches against coronaviruses are being explored and yet to be evaluated in terms of their potency, efficacy and safety, but hopefully the process of evaluation will be accelerated in the coming days (Cyranoski 2020; Lu 2020; Pillaiyar et al. 2020; Zaher et al. 2020 ).",12.193554562598845,7.0509504584418075

Dr. Miller described the limitations of current multivalent seasonal vaccines and the monovalent 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine that had negligible effect on the spread of virus due to the rate of vaccine production and distribution. These factors have necessitated new approaches to vaccine development. The discovery of bnAbs that target the highly-conserved stalk domain of hemagglutinin have raised hopes for vaccines capable of conferring ""universal"" immunity against influenza viruses. These antibodies are normally made in low quantities, but can be substantially boosted through exposure to ""pandemic-like"" hemagglutinin (HA) proteins [25] [26] [27] , and by overcoming the immunodominance of HA head domains [28] . By focusing research efforts on natural, polyclonal responses, Dr. Miller has discovered that both antibody isotype and specificity have major consequences on bnAb function. Specifically, stalk-binding antibodies of IgA isotype have a greater capacity to neutralize virus [29] , and Fc-dependent effector functions of bnAbs are regulated by interactions among multiple antibody specificities [30] . These findings are likely to have profound implications for the successful generation of ""universal"" influenza virus vaccines and therapeutics.",16.396376685101814,8.6580835725165

Whilst intense efforts are being made to meet the urgent need for a universal vaccine eliciting long-term immunity, passive immunoprophylaxis would have benefits of immediate short-term protection, especially of benefit to the elderly and very young ones, who have poorer antibody responses to vaccination. Control of influenza with antiviral drugs lowers the risk of complications [96] but drug resistance can develop, with adamantanes no longer recommended for use [20] . Furthermore, costeffective management in low resource settings is problematic in many endemic regions, especially in South East Asia. Broad-spectrum immunoprophylaxis holds future promise as an effective control measure for influenza. Preparation of broadly neutralizing antibodies in naïve animal donors is potentially inexpensive and independent of host immune memory to influenza viruses, where dominant responses from HA-specific memory B cells are often induced by vaccination or natural infection, a phenomenon first described as original antigenic sin [97, 98] .

All highlight the importance of supporting ongoing surveillance efforts as the cornerstone of disease prevention. Early recognition of an outbreak allows control measures to be initiated in a timely way that can shift the epidemic curve, reducing its impact and possibly its geographic spread. Enhanced surveillance measures with an emphasis on innovation, transparency and incorporation of the One Health model are critical to epidemic preparedness measures in the future. It is also crucial to encourage research during outbreaks through rapid data sharing to facilitate rapid response efforts, as is promoted through organisations such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) [9] . Vaccination, if it can be implemented in time, can also bend the epidemic curve. Promoting platforms for rapid vaccine development and deployment could provide a significant boost to outbreak control. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a public-private coalition that has been working to halt epidemics through the development of appropriate vaccines, is promoting both pathogenspecific and agnostic platform approaches [10] . These efforts deserve wide support and encouragement. In order for vaccines to be effectively employed, the growing threat of vaccine hesitancy worldwide must also be countered using methods grounded in the social sciences. Governments, through their public health agencies and in coordination with efforts like the Global Health Security Agenda, must adopt preparedness plans and exercise them before outbreaks become major threats [11] .

Viral epitopes that are conserved among most viral strains are more likely to generate cross-reactive antibodies. In this regard, researchers have focused on a small number of human MAbs, from clade B HIV-1-infected individuals, that possess broadly cross-reactive neutralizing activity [17, 18] . The cognate viral epitopes for these MAbs have been well characterized and are being evaluated as vaccine immunogens. However, for reasons that are not completely understood, these conserved viral epitopes have either been poorly immunogenic or have elicited antibodies of restricted reactivity. Improvements are being sought by introducing specific structural alterations [19, 20] and by targeting autoreactive B cell pathways [21] . These and other efforts to improve the immunogenicity of conserved neutralization epitopes should remain a high priority. Workshop participants recognized the need to expand efforts to identify and characterize new MAbs, with special attention to MAbs from non-clade B HIV-1 infections. New technologies are now available that might afford an advantage for identifying novel antibody specificities that were previously undetected [22, 23] . In addition to this focus on MAbs, sera from selected HIV-1infected individuals that can broadly neutralize HIV-1 isolates should be studied in detail. New assays allow more precise mapping of the polyclonal antibody response in these sera to better understand the epitopes targeted [5, [24] [25] [26] .

Similar observations have been found using baculovirus [46] and fowl adenovirus [47] vectors. The IBV coronavirus S protein is considered the main virus attachment protein containing critical neutralizing epitopes, thus making it ideal as a vaccine component to induce protection against coronaviruses [29, 48, 49] . Indeed, several studies suggested that the S protein could serve as major target for vaccine design against coronaviruses [33, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . The S2 protein subunit, which is expressed on the surface of IBV, is a promising immunogen and can provide increased cross-protection against various serotypes [55, 56] since it is a highly conserved region [57] . The HR region of coronavirus S2 protein is an α-helical trimeric coiled-coil [58] . Therefore, a vaccine that displays HR in its native trimeric coiled-coil conformation would perform well in chicken. Our previous research showed that a SAPN that repetitively displays a SARS coronavirus B-cell epitope from the C-terminal HR of the virus' spike protein was able to neutralize SARS-coronavirus infectivity [15] . Based on homologies between the SARS-coronavirus and IBV S proteins we hypothesized that the equivalent region of IBV S2 would have similar vaccine potential. In the present study, SAPNs that repetitively display HR2 of IBV S2 protein induced noticeably high level of antibody responses. This initial result demonstrated that the prototype of our IBV-Flagellin-SAPN nanoparticle vaccine was able to induce strong humoral immune responses in vaccinated chickens. Repetitive display of B cells epitopes is essential to enhance humoral immune responses [2, 59] . The results of our study support that appropriate HR2 epitopes were repetitively displayed likely in their native trimeric conformation by the SAPN vaccines as evidenced by the relatively strong antibody response elicited in chickens. Furthermore, our IBV-Flagellin-SAPN vaccine significantly stimulated cellular immunity and generated a memory pool as demonstrated by the response of PBMCs from vaccinated chickens to recall antigen stimulation.",11.211655588419921,7.699721803282788

Intriguingly, while the pre-exposure boost with our LP-ESAT-6 vaccine did not lead to significant improvement in efficacy of BCG upon infection of mice with Mtb, post-exposure LP-ESAT-6 boost in BCG primed mice led to a significant decrease in Mtb bacterial loads compared to the BCG vaccine group, which was associated with increased immune responses both locally in lungs and systemically in spleen.

Currently licensed inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) include the hemagglutinin (HA) viral surface protein, inducing strain-specific antibody responses that protect against antigenically matched or closely related viruses. However, due to the high mutation rate in HA, yearly update of seasonal vaccines is required to match the circulating viruses. In addition, seasonal vaccines are not effective against newly emerging influenza viruses or pandemic outbreaks [3, 4] . For this reason, a ""universal"" influenza vaccine that could offer broad-range of protection against all subtypes of influenza A virus has been the focus of research efforts for the last two decades. The addition of adjuvants, such as MF59, increases the breadth of immunity elicited by seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines [5, 6] , but not sufficiently to overcome the limitation of seasonal vaccine strain changes [7] . Therefore, several new approaches have been taken towards the development of universal influenza vaccines, including the induction of heterosubtypic immunity directed against internal, antigenically conserved proteins, such as the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix protein 1 (M1). These antigens are highly conserved and share over 90% of homology at the amino acid level among the different influenza strains [8, 9] . In addition, T-cell responses to NP or M1 antigens are associated with early virus clearance and reduced disease severity in absence of neutralizing antibodies [10, 11] . NP can elicit cross-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes useful to accelerate viral clearance [12] in addition to non-neutralizing antibodies that might have antiviral activity [13] . Previous preclinical studies have demonstrated that different types of vaccines containing NP alone or in combination with other influenza antigens, including plasmid DNA [10, [14] [15] [16] [17] , double-stranded (ds) DNA viral vectors [18, 19] , peptide [20] , or adjuvanted protein subunit [21, 22] , can protect against homologous and also heterosubtypic influenza challenge.",10.526637492213558,6.642618872892726

For this purpose we did multiple sequence alignment of the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) protein and replicase polyprotein 1ab of all six human coronaviruses. Replicase polyprotein 1ab was taken to check whether there is any conservancy among the non structural protein as this replicase polyprotein cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins. In case of S, E, M and N protein, no putative conserved region was found. But conserved region was found in case of replicae polyprotein 1ab where the conserved region was in the RNA directed RNA polymerase. This indicates that this protein is less mutating than the S, E, M and N protein. This RNA directed RNA polymerase protein was targeted to determine antigenic sites based on immunogenicity and surface accessibility using different bioinformatics analyses. The consensus antigenic sites were the desired one and their conservancy was also determined. From the conservancy analysis it was found that Bepipred [29] and IEDB [28] analysis predicted consensus epitope YPKCDRA and the surface accessibility analysis [30] predicted epitope WDYPKC are 100% conserved. This 100% conserved WDYPKC and YPKCDRA are actually located in the same region of RNA directed RNA polymerase and it was then taken as the targeted epitope. This epitope was found to be accessible and hydrophilic which is one of the crucial requirements for an epitope to be used as a vaccine. This reflects a promising scope to use this conserved epitope as a universal vaccine both as preventive and therapeutic treatment.

Though at first it was thought that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are structurally similar and tried to treat MERS-CoV infected patient with the SASR-CoV treatment.

Thus, the circulating influenza A and B strains are reviewed annually for antigenic match with current vaccines, Replacement of vaccine strains may occur regularly, and annual vaccination is recommended to assure protection [4, 26, 27] . For the northern hemisphere, vaccine strain selection occurs in February and then manufacturers begin production, taking at least six months to produce the millions of vaccine doses required for the fall [27] .

LAIV is not recommended for all populations; however, it is generally considered to be as effective as inactivated vaccines and may be more efficacious in children [4, 9, 24] . While LAIV relies on antigenic match and the HA and NA antigens are replaced on the same schedule as the TIV [4, 9] , there is some suggestion that LAIV may induce broader protection than TIV due to the diversity of the immune response consistent with inducing virus-neutralizing serum and mucosal antibodies, as well as broadly reactive T cell responses [9, 23, 29] . While overall both TIV and LAIV are considered safe and effective, there is a recognized need for improved seasonal influenza vaccines [26] .

Viral fusion, regardless of fusion protein, proceeds through the creation of hemifusion, an intermediate state in which proximal lipid monolayer leaflets of membranes, in contact with one another, have merged, but the distal monolayers remain distinct. Because inhibition of fusion was universal, independent of viral protein, it is extremely unlikely that GA targeted the fusion proteins themselves. This is consistent with GA inhibiting the creation of the hemifusion intermediate, and universal inhibition would be expected. It is well known that agents conferring positive spontaneous curvature, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), inhibit fusion induced by viral and non-viral fusion proteins 17 . Likewise, the cone-shaped lipid oleic acid (OA) has a negative spontaneous membrane curvature, which favors hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer, and its presence relieves the inhibition of fusion 18 . The addition of OA together with GA abolished the inhibitory effect of GA (Fig. 6B) , indicating that GA induces positive membrane curvature. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/",11.243573032792078,6.626957302333397

Moreover, the immunoinformatics techniques applied to T-cells have advanced to a greater degree than those dealing with B-cells. Indeed, it is now a common practice to identify the vaccine candidates using in silico approaches before being subjected to in vitro confirmatory studies (Gupta et al. 2009; Ranjbar et al. 2015) . The major objective of our study was to identify an immunogenic peptide pool containing epitopes that can be effective against all the high-risk HPV strains circulating globally. Some cross-protections were already observed in case of previously identified vaccines. Such as, Cervarix vaccine which was initially designed by targeting HPV 16 and 18 strains but later found to provide additional cross-protections against HPV 31, 33 and 45 strains. However, most of the highrisk HPV strains were evolved by accumulating random mutations in the epitopes recognizing regions and therefore many of the high-risk strains are not effectively targeted by available HPV vaccines. Therefore, we used the consensus epitopes extracted from highly conserved regions of E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from all the highrisk HPV strains identified so far. The vaccine formulated by the proposed peptide pool can alert the body's immune system to generate immunization memory cells upon injecting. Subsequently, as these are MHC class I epitopes, the proteasomal degradation machineries can degrade the whole vaccine and release these conserved epitopes in host. Furthermore, because of the conserved nature of the epitopes the immune system will be trained to recognize these epitopes in case of HPV infection by any high-risk strains and thus can provide the crossprotection. Using the computational workflow presented in this manuscript, we identified 14 conserved immunogenic peptide fragments from 4 early proteins (E1, E2, E6 and E7) of 16 high-risk HPV types providing CD8? responses which can be validated experimentally for the designing of an universal vaccine against all the high-risk HPV strains.",11.289907030607326,6.7509031954614045

Nevertheless, current flu vaccination still presents several limitations that make it fall short of expectations in terms of effectiveness. The short duration of vaccine-induced immunity coupled with the intrinsic antigenic drift of influenza viruses resulting from the gradual accumulation of point mutations in the antigenic sites of the HA (and to a lesser extent the NA) surface protein underscore the need of the annual reformulation of vaccine composition. Moreover, the length of the current vaccine manufacturing process (at least 6 months to produce sufficiently large vaccine quantities) demands continual strain selection to be done approximately 8 months before the next flu season (6, 8) . Should an antigenic drift occur during this time window, the possibility of a mismatch between the vaccine composition and circulating strains might negatively affect protection. Even in the absence of seasonal mismatches or the emergence of pandemic strains, insufficient vaccine coverage and suboptimal uptake in specific target groups (i.e., the elderly or the immunocompromised) also compromise vaccine effectiveness. Furthermore, despite the recent progress made in the pursue of the ""Holy Grail"" of a universal influenza vaccine that can provide broader, long-lasting protection against both matching, and antigenically diverse influenza strains (9, 10), their clinical effectiveness remains to be evaluated, hence highlighting the need of complementary therapeutic approaches to manage influenza infections.",11.348425730308204,6.517894125465659

Because of their history of emergence events due to their prevalence in zoonotic pools, designing live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines that can be rapidly and broadly implemented is essential for outbreak preparedness. Here, we show that coronaviruses with completely rewired transcription regulatory networks (TRNs) are effective vaccines against SARS-CoV. The TRN-rewired viruses are attenuated and protect against lethal SARS-CoV challenge. While a 3-nt rewired TRN reverts via second-site mutation upon serial passage, a 7-nt rewired TRN is more stable, suggesting that a more extensively rewired TRN might be essential for avoiding growth selection.

We report here the rational design of an attenuated recombinant coronavirus vaccine based on a deletion in the coding sequence of the nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). In cell culture, nsp1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), like its SARS-coronavirus homolog, strongly reduced cellular gene expression. The effect of nsp1 on MHV replication in vitro and in vivo was analyzed using a recombinant MHV encoding a deletion in the nsp1-coding sequence. The recombinant MHV nsp1 mutant grew normally in tissue culture, but was severely attenuated in vivo. Replication and spread of the nsp1 mutant virus was restored almost to wild-type levels in type I interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice, indicating that nsp1 interferes efficiently with the type I IFN system. Importantly, replication of nsp1 mutant virus in professional antigen-presenting cells such as conventional dendritic cells and macrophages, and induction of type I IFN in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, was not impaired. Furthermore, even low doses of nsp1 mutant MHV elicited potent cytotoxic T cell responses and protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenge.

Dr. Jean de Carro, for example, aided in the elimination of variolation and its substitution with vaccination. Some of the major efforts implemented in America were initiated by Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, who received the vaccine from Edward Jenner and vaccinated his own family. He later proved that they acquired immunity when they remained asymptomatic after he infected them with smallpox. Waterhouse worked effectively on making vaccination universal in the U.S. Unfortunately, like any other medical breakthrough, problems arose both because Waterhouse aimed at making profit and the public was not ready to implement these procedures. However, after breaking his initial monopoly, Waterhouse accepted to share his vaccines and made the supplies available to other physicians (24) . Despite all these efforts, smallpox epidemics continued to occur and Jenner stated in a pamphlet that he wrote, ""The annihilation of the small pox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the final result of this practice. "" Eradication was finally achieved 176 years later. The time it took could be attributed to the fact that Jenner did not think of the necessity of revaccination nor of the instability of vaccines, which made them unable to handle different environmental conditions, including countries other than England (30) .",13.231444553202616,4.820759723939676

Advances in the fields of protein engineering, systems and synthetic biology have accelerated these efforts to transform model organisms like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in real microbial cell factories for the sustainable production of flavonoids [37] [38] [39] . Subsequently, strategies for the in vivo glycosylation of flavonoids have also been developed. These are typically based on both the overexpression of specific glycosyltransferases, which transfer a sugar residue from an activated nucleotide sugar to an aglycon in a stereoand regioselective way, and the engineering or introduction of the targeted nucleotide sugar pathway. In this way, Fig. 1 Transformation of E. coli W into a sucrose-based galactosylation and rhamnosylation platform. The metabolic engineering strategy applied makes use of several gene deletions (indicated in red) and overexpressions of genes (indicated in green). The rational of a split metabolism is applied, whereby sucrose is divided by sucrose phosphorylase (BaSP) in fructose to be used for growth and a glucose 1-phosphate as activated precursor for UDP-glucose. The latter is a universal pivot molecule for the formation of UDP-galactose and UDP-rhamnose, interconversions catalyzed by the enzymes GalE and MUM4, respectively. To ensure growth-coupled production, various genes, involved in the metabolization of these UDPsugars and their precursors, were knocked out (shown in red). The production of the bioactive quercetin glycosides hyperoside and quercitrin was chosen to evaluate the versatility of the engineered production platform. Finally, the introduction of either the glycosyltransferase F3GT or RhaGT ensures efficient galactosylation or rhamnosylation, respectively various quercetin glycosides have already been produced in E. coli such as the naturally occurring 3-O-glucoside [40] , 3-O-xyloside [41] and 3,7-O-bisrhamnoside [42] , or the new-to-nature quercetin 3-O-(6-deoxytalose) [43] . However, despite these engineering efforts, the reported product rates and titers are still in the milligram range, rendering these microbial production hosts unsuitable for industrial applications. The developed production processes are typically biphasic bioconversion processes using resting cells, which makes it difficult to improve production rates [44] .

Because of the extent of HIV-1 infection in southern Africa, any immunisation programme will require enormous quantities of vaccine. DNA vaccines are expensive to manufacture, as are recombinant viral and subunit vaccines produced via cell culture.

Whereas in PFGE, serotype and MLST, isolates can be identified as at coarse levels of relatedness, genotyping offers higher-resolution typing. An isolate seen as closely related (C 1 ) to the index case (X) in whole genome sequencing may be indistinguishable (I) in the first three methods, whereas a more distantly related isolate, as seen by whole genome sequencing (C 2 ), might appear as closely related. Moreover, as described in the text, the integration of sequencing with molecular evolutionary theory provides much greater opportunity for phylogenetic inference, offering conceptual leaps beyond other typing methods and greater contributions to infectious disease epidemiology. Advances in diagnostic tools have led to a more refined understanding of the dynamics of many infectious diseases by typing the pathogens by a genetic or phenotypic feature and adding these data to the line list ( Table 2) . Influenza again provides an illustrative example. Whereas during the 1918 influenza pandemic, the etiology of influenza was unknown (and mistakenly attributed to Pfeiffer's bacillus, now called Haemophilus influenzae), we now have tools to confirm that an individual's infection is caused by influenza virus, and further to characterize it by viral type, of which there are two relevant to human disease, A and B, and by subtype, defined by hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), with examples including A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and A/ H5N1. These data have clinical and epidemiological significance. Clinically, they aid in guiding treatment and prevention plans and in the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics -for example, in 2009, recommended antiviral treatment regimens varied depending on whether an individual was infected with influenza A/ H1N1, influenza A/H3N2 or influenza B [7] . In the area of prevention, development of effective vaccines depends now on the identification of antigenic variants within each subtype and construction of vaccines targeted to these antigenic variants [18] . Epidemiologically, rather than grouping all individuals with clinical influenza as the same, these tools have aided in understanding the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of influenza lineages [8] [9] [10] 19, 20] , as well as the different profiles of mortality caused by each subtype [21] . Ironically, recent efforts to create a universal influenza vaccine effective against all subtypes may obviate some of the public health need to track individual subtypes [22] . Yet, if successful, the development of such vaccines will have depended on extensive studies of vaccine immunogenicity and protective efficacy against defined serotypes.",10.884408166725116,4.482710544518169

Similar findings were also reported at the beginning of the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Hong Kong [16] , and in the United Kingdom, 28% of subjects reported changing their hand washing behavior as a result of H1N1 influenza [10] . We also found that of participants 68.27% reported ventilating rooms more frequently than before, and nearly half (48.76%) cancelled or postponed their social events because of A/H7N9. When viewed together, the data from these studies implies that preventative health behaviors become more prevalent during infectious disease epidemics. Furthermore, our data revealed [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, men need special targeting for health education, especially to improve their knowledge of influenza, because knowledge of influenza and perceived effectiveness of personal hygiene practices (PHPs) has been shown to be associated with PHPs [20] . We found that more than one-third of participants stated that after the emergence of H7N9, they no longer bought chickens or other poultry to eat. A previous study has revealed that perceived theoretical threat from poultry was associated with less buying of live poultry [21] . We should be aware that the prolonged warning that a future pandemic could be sparked by avian influenza viruses is likely to cause pandemic fatigue in the public, and would probably not change their perception of avian influenza risk and associated protective behavior [22] . Some causal beliefs and lay perceptions of avian influenza contradicted public health efforts at control [23] . Therefore, more effort should be made to improve compliance of proper preventive measures and reduce panic among the public. In addition, because the Guangzhou population faces risks from the high prevalence of exposure during purchase and poultry rearing [24] , better management for raising and selling poultry in Guangzhou is needed. The high proportion (84.00%) of participants indicating a willingness to receive H7N9 vaccine if it is available bodes well for influenza prevention through vaccination in Guangzhou. Of those whose response was ""no"", the primary reason for unwillingness to accept a vaccine was concern about the safety of the new vaccine. A similar finding was also observed during the pH1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong, which indicated that perceived risk from the pH1N1 vaccine could inhibit pH1N1 vaccine uptake [25] . These results suggest that some participants lacked an understanding of the process of developing influenza vaccine based on the probability of strains. While we only studied a small subset of the population in Guangzhou, if these results were found to be representative, educational materials distributed about the novel influenza vaccine should focus on its safety record, manufacturing, and the similarities between seasonal influenza vaccination and the H7N9 vaccine. These efforts could help to dispel these fears, considering that we found that participants who had received influenza vaccine within recent three years were nearly two times more likely to accept H7N9 vaccine compared with those who had not.",10.273649412398688,4.390505761301074

When APC specific uptake is enhanced, this generally results in a drastically reduced dose requirement [125, 126] . On the contrary, when we evaluated the CTL inducing capacity of broad tropism versus DC targeted LVs encoding OVA, we could not demonstrate a substantial benefit of DC targeted LVs over broad tropism LVs in terms of dose requirement without loss of efficacy [45] . Another striking observation was made by comparing different doses of in situ delivered targeted versus untargeted infectious nonreplicative OVA-encoding adenoviral vectors. While targeted delivery outperformed untargeted delivery after low dose administration, more effector CD8 + T cells were induced with high doses of untargeted vaccine compared to targeted delivery. Interestingly, the protective capacity of the nontargeted vaccine was superior to that of the targeted vaccine in a tumor challenge model, demonstrating dose-dependent effects of DC targeting on the quality of the induced immune response [127] .",14.620406737906313,7.396927508556745

Indeed, when mice were treated with OVA, coupled or fused to Abs against DEC205, a more than 100-fold efficient and potent response was measured compared to untargeted antigens [128, 131] . Furthermore, several preclinical and clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of APC targeted vaccines for human immunotherapy, which are summarized elsewhere [140] . However, most studies evaluating targeted antitumor vaccination are based on targeting receptors such as DEC205 and the mannose receptor CD206 (see Table 2 ), which are not specifically expressed by one particular DC subset. Therefore, it is hard to draw any conclusions with regard to an enhanced efficiency for antitumor immunity upon exclusive targeting of one DC subset. Moreover, when we targeted cDCs alone or also pDCs and macrophages using nanobody displaying LVs encoding OVA, we only observed clear differences in the induced CD4 + T-cell profiles, while the therapeutic outcome of the cDC and the cDC as well as pDC targeted vaccine was comparable but most importantly less strong than that of the broad tropism LV vaccine [45] . Furthermore, it has been questioned if targeting as such is responsible for the increased immunogenicity compared to untargeted delivery, since this increase has also been ascribed to the immunomodulating role of the targeting moiety itself and less by targeting the specific DC subset [120, 121, 141] .",11.932573637967987,5.922882725359986

Environmental drivers such as seasonal fluctuations in rainfall, temperature, vegetation coverage or mosquito abundance will help guide surveillance and control efforts targeted mostly towards the mosquito vector and its ecology [68] . Once infection occurs, an important and unresolved question for dengue is how to best optimize the delivery of intervention strategies to reduce disease incidence, which is largely determined by R 0 . Our analysis shows that the interaction between mixing parameters and force of infection has potentially large implications for optimizing targeted intervention, particularly in countries where transmission is high and resources are scarce [69] . In fact, this may be even more important in areas of low transmission where incidence appears to be rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 12: 20150468 more focal [70] . Again, however, more attention is needed to determine the spatial and temporal resolution of appropriate intervention strategies and the effects of key covariates and model parameters [62] . Empirical understanding of the spatial scale that is most appropriate for carrying out large-scale interventions remains unknown. Once transmission has occurred in one place, understanding not only spatial heterogeneity in transmission dynamics but also their subsequent spread in mechanistic stochastic models would help to empirically determine the propagation of the disease [71] . Interest in spatial spread dynamics has risen with increasing importation of dengue into heretofore non-endemic areas due to travel and trade continentally and internationally [72] . Exploration of the case data in Pakistan that we analysed here suggests that the virus spreads along major transport routes from Lahore to Karachi and north to Rawalpindi. Using results presented here on mixing coefficients and environmental drivers will help pinpoint areas of major risk of importation more accurately, especially in the case of recurring epidemics. We explored the consequences of a spatially differentiated mixing coefficient in the context of transmission potential within this analysis. Using the fitted relationships of the environmental drivers of transmission and R 0 will enable future analyses and comparisons between diseases and geographical regions. In this context, it will be instrumental to integrate a variety of movement and social network models with the evidence presented here to infer more accurately how the geographical spread of dengue is determined.

To increase vaccine uptake by APCs, the most straightforward way is represented by vaccine delivery into an APC rich site such as the tumor draining lymph node or spleen. For example, when we delivered TAA encoding lentiviral vectors (LVs) or mRNA intranodally in mice, a stronger therapeutic CD8 + T-cell response was induced than after subcutaneous delivery [45, 52] . Alternatively vaccines can be developed in such a way that they become prone to accumulation in lymphoid organs [53] [54] [55] . The latter is exemplified by two different studies in tumor bearing mice with nanoparticles (NPs) coupled to adjuvant alone or also a TAA. The NPs accumulated in the tumor draining lymph nodes when intradermally administered in the limb ipsilateral to the tumor or in the nontumor draining lymph node when administered in the contralateral limb. Interestingly, only when these NPs were targeted to the tumor draining lymph node, the CD4 + T-cell distribution within the tumor repolarized towards a T H 1 phenotype and an increased frequency of therapeutic antigen-specific CD8 + T cells within the tumor was observed. Together, these data implicate that the tumor draining lymph node is an appealing vaccine target for solid tumors and can be targeted with NPs [56] [57] [58] . Of note also skin DC networks have been targeted via the use of polymeric dissolving microneedle arrays with nanoencapsulated antigen [59, 60] .",11.161762751283648,4.7903022336461545

Three of these are most conserved enzymes of nidoviruses: an ORF1aencoded protease with chymotrypsin-like fold (3C-like protease, 3CLpro) [49] [50] [51] , an ORF1b-encoded RdRp [49, 52, 53] and a superfamily 1 helicase (HEL1) [54] [55] [56] [57] (reviewed in [58] ). For other proteins, relationships have been established only between some nidovirus lineages, mostly due to poor sequence similarity. Two tightly correlated properties separate large-and intermediatesized nidoviruses from all other ssRNA+ viruses, classified in several dozens of families and hundreds of species: a genome size exceeding 20 kb and the presence of a gene encoding a RNA 39to-59 exoribonuclease (ExoN), which resides in nsp14 in the case of coronaviruses [10] . The latter enzyme is distantly related to a DNA proofreading enzyme, and it is genetically segregated and expressed together with RdRp and HEL1 [14, 59] . Based on these properties ExoN was implicated in improving the fidelity of replication in large-and intermediate-sized nidoviruses. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the excessive accumulation of mutations in ExoN-defective mutants of two coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus [60] and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [61] , the identification of an RNA 39end mismatch excision activity in the SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14 complex [62] , and the high efficacy of a live coronavirus vaccine displaying impaired replication fidelity due to nsp14-knockout [63] (for review see [64, 65] ). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying ExoN's function in fidelity control remain to be elucidated, its acquisition by nidoviruses likely enabled genome expansions beyond the limit observed for other non-segmented ssRNA+ viruses [10, 19] . Since ExoN-encoding nidoviruses have evolved genomes that may differ by up to ,12 kb (from 20.2 kb of Nam Dinh virus, NDiV, to 31.7 kb of Beluga whale coronavirus SW1, BWCoV-SW1), there must be other factors in addition to the proof-reading enzyme that control genome size.",11.57898473198144,4.243179066074142

According to recent estimates, close to 60 million symptomatic cases occur every year, and the overall economic burden of dengue is nearly $9 billion (1). Vaccine development efforts have resulted in the introduction of the first-ever dengue virus vaccine for human use in many countries, and other promising vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of clinical trials (2) (3) (4) . Nevertheless, there is a lack of significant progress in antiviral development for dengue virus. A number of compounds have been identified as dengue virus inhibitors using in vitro and in silico approaches, but these compounds have not advanced to clinical trials in humans. Chloroquine, celgosivir, and balapiravir are the only drugs that have reached the clinical-trials stage; however, no results have been reported for these studies (ClinicalTrials.gov registration numbers NCT00849602, NCT01619969, and NCT01096576, respectively). Repurposing of drugs is one way of fast-tracking antiviral discovery, as it builds on preexisting knowledge of the candidate drug. In cases where the drug has been proven to be safe for human use for other conditions, this process helps to bring the drug to human use faster than a new candidate drug, which, according to industry estimates, takes 12 to 15 years from discovery to therapeutic use (5, 6) . Drug-repurposing efforts have yielded the first antiretroviral, zidovudine (originally evaluated as an anticancer drug), approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog used for cancer treatment, has been shown to inhibit many viruses (7, 8) .

In addition, understanding the mechanism(s) of regulation of the viral polymerase complex could assist in the rational design of safer and more immunogenic and protective LAIV. In this review, we have discussed the use of ts, ca, and att mutations in IAV for the generation of LAIV. This approach could provide a deliberate method of viral attenuation, which could be applicable for the treatment of either seasonal and/or pandemic IAV infections, or viral strains infecting other host species. Furthermore, combination of polymerase thermosensitivity with other approaches can assure a higher attenuated profile for the development of safer LAIV as well as advance in the generation of universal IAV vaccines [35, 38, 58, 103, 126, 179, 180] .

These clones have been analysed for the expression of E and M by PCR using genomic DNA as template and RT -PCR using poly(A)-containing RNA as template (Figure 2A) , and immunofluorescent microscopy ( Figure 2B ). Five out of six cell clones were found to contain and express both, E and M. Noteworthy, two considerations have been made before the construction of the EM cell line. First, the E and M genes in these cell lines are expressed by the cellular transcription of two separate mRNAs to minimize the possibility of reconstitution of infectious viruses by recombination of the MHV vector RNA with E and M gene mRNAs ( Figure 2C ). Second, in order to achieve high titer MHV VLP production, we decided to use a mouse cell line which is susceptible to MHV infection (17-clone1) for the stable transfection of MHV E and M genes.

With the reverse genetic systems available, it is now possible to make use of the unique characteristics of coronavirus transcription to develop coronavirus expression vectors. The rationale of expressing heterologous genes using coronavirus-mediated transcription is to insert a transcriptional cassette, comprised of a coronavirus TRS located upstream of the gene of interest, into a coronavirus genome, minigenome or vector RNA. We have shown for human coronavirus vector RNAs that a region of at least 5.7 kb is dispensable for discontinuous transcription (Thiel et al. 2001b) . This region contained all structural genes and, therefore, our vector RNAs are not infectious. We could demonstrate that it is possible to construct a human coronavirus vector RNA capable to mediate the expression of multiple heterologous proteins. Noteworthy, this vector RNA can be packaged to VLPs if the structural proteins are expressed in trans (Thiel et al. 2003) . These results indicate that coronavirus-based vector systems might be useful for heterologous gene expression, especially for longer and multiple genes. An important consideration for viral vaccine vectors is their potential for efficient delivery of their genetic material to specific target cells. For example, targeting of viral vaccine vectors to DCs is highly desirable in order to optimize vaccine efficacy. It is important to note that the HCoV 229E receptor, human aminopeptidase N (hAPN or CD13), is expressed at high levels on human DCs (Summers et al. 2001 ). This implies that HCoV 229E-based VLPs could be used to efficiently (receptor-mediated uptake) transduce these cells. We could demonstrate that HCoV 229E-based VLPs can be used to transduce immature and mature human DCs (Thiel et al. 2003) . Therefore, this new class of safe, multigene vectors, based on HCoV 229E, represents a particularly promising tool to genetically deliver multiple antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines to human DCs.",10.693077146880213,7.072975119904015

It is therefore important to gain as much quantitative information about disease transmission as possible from existing surveillance data. This includes monitoring how transmission varies with time, location and other epidemiological characteristics of individual cases. By improving the understanding of mechanisms of disease transmission, finer tuning within the spectrum of intervention strategies becomes possible [15, 16] .

Insights into the ontogeny of these rare B cells could allow the design of a step-wise vaccine regimen that stimulates the germ-line precursor to expand and mature to produce circulating bnAbs which could protect against HIV acquisition (10, 11) . For RSV, stabilized versions of the fusion (F) protein in the pre-fusion conformation have led to insights in the B cell's response to infection and has generated potentially safer and more efficacious vaccine candidates (12, 13) . Influenza also performs fusion through the stem region of the hemagglutinin protein, and the identification of B cells that target this relatively conserved site has spurred research on the development of a universal influenza vaccine (14) (15) (16) . Like RSV, HIV, and influenza, the fusion proteins of EBV and CMV exist in a pre-fusion conformation, and stabilization in their pre-fusion states could greatly accelerate vaccine development against these pathogens (17-19). Rare memory B cells producing antibodies specific for the EBV fusion machinery have been isolated; these can neutralize both B cell and epithelial cell infection (20). A new paradigm in malaria vaccine development is also emerging with the discovery of IgM+ and IgD+ memory B cells targeting the Merozoite Surface Protein 1, that rapidly respond to malaria re-infection (21). Further, highly potent neutralizing antibodies targeting a novel and conserved site on the Circumsporozoite Protein have been isolated from B cells (22). Together, these examples demonstrate the importance of studying antigen-specific humoral responses to infectious diseases. The solutions to the crystal structures of surface proteins for a variety of pathogens, the conformational stabilization of these antigens, and the application of the methods summarized in this review, to probe antigen-specific B cell responses, have created new opportunities for systematic and rational vaccine design for HIV, RSV, EBV, malaria, and many other pathogens.",11.519069590896432,4.811090801711402

Data in support of this strategy showed that in children with bronchiectasis, the capacity to produce IFN-γ in response to NTHi was highest in those who had received three or more doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that contained H. influenzae protein D (PHiD-CV) (51), a surface protein expressed by H. influenzae, not present in the HiB vaccine (52) .

Advocates of PPP experimentation further argue that creating potentially pandemic strains of a particular virus, e.g., A/H5N1, could facilitate the production and stockpiling of vaccines against that variant. However, given that PPP experiments inevitably consider only a few possible genetic pathways to transmissibility, and that the precise correspondence between transmissibility in the ferret model and human transmissibility remains uncertain, we can never know whether PPP experimentation would hit upon the antigenic composition of the next pandemic strain that will emerge from nature. Indeed, as described below, it is clear that there is no one-to-one mapping between a few genetic changes in a virus and its transmissibility. By contrast, universal influenza vaccines currently in preclinical and clinical trials [37] may, with further development, prove to be more worthwhile to stockpile for the purposes of pandemic preparedness than an assortment of vaccines targeting antigenic variants manufactured via PPP experimentation.",10.989187987501516,7.346941553701244

As mosquitoes constantly take blood meals from humans, especially in the tropics, the availability of samples is enormous. Xenosurveillance is less invasive and logistically challenging compared to traditional sampling methods. Sample storage is simple and cost effective. As well, sample quality does not appear to suffer from being collected by a mosquito, as there are no substantial differences between samples collected via xenosurveillance or finger-stick. However it remains to be determined if samples collected by xenosurveillance are useful for other means of disease surveillance (e.g. serology). Xenosurveillance is capable of detecting a wide array of pathogens [30] , although this study did not reliably detect parasites and bacteria infecting humans. However, zoonotic, viral pathogens are disproportionately likely to reach pandemic emergence, as compared to parasites or bacteria [14] . Recent pandemics of zoonotic viruses, including Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Zika virus support this notion [61] [62] [63] . In theory, routine xenosurveillance could provide early warnings by detecting emerging pathogens circulating at low levels in vulnerable populations. As well, xenosurveillance can be targeted to support epidemiological services by collecting engorged mosquitoes in areas where suspected pathogen transmission is occurring [64] . Species specific PCR can be used to identify known or suspected pathogens from xenosurveillance samples, although the use of NGS provides an unbiased detection approach. As the cost of high throughput NGS continues to decrease, large scale sequencing projects are becoming more universal [65] . Furthermore, as field applicable sequencing tools are being further developed and optimized, the use of real-time NGS for surveillance and diagnosis of pathogens is being realized [66] [67] [68] [69] . The combination of xenosurveillance and novel sequencing strategies has the potential to bring active, real-time, disease surveillance to resource-poor areas of the world.

A requirement for cathepsin B activity during entry of EBOV-, TAFV-and BDBV-but not SUDV-, RESTV and MARV-GP-bearing pseudotypes has been described, and the same group showed that particles harboring the GP 1,2 of EBOV, SUDV and MARV exhibited enhanced transduction efficiency when cathepsin L was active in concert with cathepsin B. In contrast, entry of RESTV was dependent on a cysteine protease distinct from cathepsins B and L [125] . Furthermore, it has been reported that cathepsin L activity is dispensable for ebolavirus GP 1,2 -driven entry into Vero cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts [57, 125] as well as human monocyte-derived dendritic cells [128] . Moreover, the observation of the failure of EBOV-GP 1,2 -bearing pseudotypes to transduce CatB − / − CatL − / − mouse embryonic fibroblasts can be overcome by ectopic expression of CatB, suggests that a protease other than CatL is required for a post-CatB cleavage step necessary for membrane fusion [125] . In addition, transduction of primary human macrophages by EBOV-GP 1,2 -carrying pseudotypes was shown to be dependent on both cathepsin B and L, whereas MARV-GP 1,2 -facilitated entry was not blocked efficiently by cathepsin B/L inhibitors, suggesting that MARV-GP 1,2 might employ a so far unknown protease for priming in macrophages [177] . It is also noteworthy that many studies investigating the role of cathepsins in filovirus host cell entry were performed with GP 1,2 -bearing vectors and not with authentic filoviruses.

An efficient vaccine for the prophylaxis of humans in hotspots of the infection (e.g., Saudi Arabia) is necessary but no commercial vaccines are yet approved. In this study, a chimeric DNA construct was designed to encode an influenza A/H1N1 NA protein which is flanking immunogenic amino acids (aa) 736-761 of MERS-CoV spike protein. Using the generated chimeric construct, a novel recombinant vaccine strain against pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) and MERS-CoV was generated (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3). The chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 vaccine strain comprises a recombinant PR8-based vaccine, expressing the PB1, HA, and chimeric NA of pandemic 2009 H1N1. Interestingly, an increase in replication efficiency of the generated vaccine strain was observed when compared to the PR8-based 5 + 3 H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain that lacks the MERS-CoV spike peptide insert. In BALB/c mice, the inactivated chimeric bivalent vaccine induced potent and specific neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and H1N1pdm09. This novel approach succeeded in developing a recombinant influenza virus with potential use as a bivalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV. This approach provides a basis for the future development of chimeric influenza-based vaccines against MERS-CoV and other viruses.

However, the global distribution of vaccine production is far from equal between industrial nations and the developing world: according to a survey made in 2015, only 5% of influenza vaccine doses were distributed among Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Africa WHO regions, which comprise about half of the world's population (17) . In addition, most currently licensed vaccines would take 5-3 months between identification of a pandemic influenza and vaccine distribution, which would give a pandemic virus ample time for global spread.

Both influenza and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus, the causative agent of AIDS) are the good examples of such issues. The influenza A virus HA (hemagglutinin) molecule consists of a ''head'' globular domain and a tail-''stem'' domain and is believed to harbor both the immunogenic and protective components for vaccination. However, immunization with the head domain was proposed to elicit only subtype-specific, even strain-specific, protection; for example, the H5 head domain alone as immunogen elicits H5-specific protection (Xuan et al., 2011) . To date, there are 18 defined subtypes (H1-H16 and HA-like H17/18) of influenza A virus HAs belonging to two broad groups (group 1 and group 2); thus, subtype-specific antibodies can only provide protection against a limited subset of viruses. On the other hand, the HA ''stem'' is the least variable region on the HA surface from the primary sequences. For this reason, great efforts have been focused on the development of influenza vaccines that depend on protective epitopes in the stem domain (Wu and Wilson, 2018) , but the vaccination strategies used to elicit these antibodies, for example by removing the head domain, have not yet translated into a universal vaccine.",11.22948639369493,8.211555884994764

The antibodies to this epitope protect mice from infection, despite poor neutralizing activity in vitro, prompting us not to ignore the potential protective properties of non-neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, these studies support that the head-interface epitopes are conserved across most influenza groups and may not be under the immune pressure that would mediate the antigenic drift of the virus. Therefore, the occluded epitope might represent an ideal immunogenic candidate and should be considered in a universal influenza vaccine along with the HA-stem-based antigens. How we can obtain and immunize against more breathing epitopes remains a big issue for the future studies.

Measures for organizational support included management making health and safety a high priority, taking all reasonable steps to minimize hazards, encouraging employees' involvement in health and safety matters, and actively working to protect employees. This finding shows how important it is that nurses think their health and safety are valued by their employer. Those who think that they are valued will engage in healthier work behaviors. Interventions targeted at improving how supportive the organization is of employee health and safety can result in enhanced compliance. This finding is supported in the literature related to universal precautions. 4, 25 An absence of job hindrances was shown to be linked to enhanced compliance at the univariate level. Proper use of facial protection can be hindered by the type of duty carried out (eg, carrying out a long procedure while using a tight-fitting respirator), a lack of time to properly use and dispose of the equipment (eg, busy unit or emergency situation), and the desire to provide good quality patient care (eg, having the patient unable to see your facial expression while explaining a risky procedure). One study found that a worker's perception that the use of universal precautions interfered with their work (job hindrance) was a strong predictor of failure to comply with universal precautions. 16 Reducing or eliminating these or other identified job hindrances is a good strategy to enhance compliance. The literature has also shown that a lack of available time and a heavy workload negatively influenced compliance with hand hygiene precautions.

The immune mechanism being targeted by the vaccine was T cell-dependent antibody production against Aβ,0.1634317323161596,1.883999228477478,2.499816417694092,3402d3de-fdc6-432a-9af8-a5ffcb6e4573,custom_license/Immunosenescence Modulation by Vaccination 116,"The postulated age-related defect that leads to the pathology of AD related to APC uptake of Aβ and stimulation of Th1 cytokines, an inflammatory response to Aβ. This defect is associated with inefficient phagocytosis of Aβ and the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α) and chemokines, and nitric oxide leading to complement activation and T cell apoptosis . The immune mechanism being targeted by the vaccine was T cell-dependent antibody production against Aβ to form Aβ-antibody complexes for more efficient clearing of the Aβ. Earlier studies had shown that Aβ 1-42 effectively stimulated a proliferative response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This response was increased in older compared to young adult subjects and a further significant increase was observed in older adult subjects with AD . It had been shown that Aβ 1-15 was responsible for B cell stimulation and the production of antibodies to Aβ, and Aβ 15-42 most effectively stimulated T cell proliferation and the production of both T h 1 (IFN-γ) and T h 2 (IL-13) cytokines. Because a T h 1 (vs. T h 2) response in the AD mouse model was associated with more effective clearance of Aβ in the mouse model, QS21 adjuvant was added to the Aβ vaccine used in human trials to stimulate a Th1 response to the vaccine. It is postulated that the adjuvanted vaccine activated Aβ-specific memory T cells that migrated to the sites of Aβ deposition in the brain producing Th1 cytokines. Although the antibody response appeared to effectively clear Aβ, the inflammatory cytokine response of the T cell infiltrate leads to meningoencephalitis. Since the Aβ 15-42 stimulated both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, it appears that the addition of the QS21 adjuvant may have been responsible for the serious adverse effects of the Aβ vaccine (Monsonego and Weiner 2003) . While efforts continue to develop immunologic-based therapies for AD, the results of this clinical trial continue to have significant consequences for future vaccine development and a recent review cites a critical need for new development strategies (Marciani 2016) .",10.877137892871577,6.656478432516572

The first construct consisted of a recombinant mAb with V regions specific for CD40 and its C region containing a defined T cell epitope. The other was a homodimer, each chain of which was composed of a single-chain variable region fragment (scFv) targeting CD40, a dimerization motif, and an antigenic unit. Both constructs bound CD40, induced maturation of DC, and enhanced primary and memory T cell responses. Intramuscular delivery of these vaccine constructs, in the form of naked DNA, induced T cell responses specific for the MHC class II-restricted epitopes, antibody responses, and protected mice from myeloma and lymphoma growth. The observed effects were attributed to both targeted delivery of antigen to APC for presentation on MHC class II molecules and simultaneous activation of the targeted APC. Since CD8 + CTL have the ability to specifically recognize and kill tumor cells, recent efforts in the development of anti-cancer vaccines have mainly focused on enhancing induction of tumor-specific CD8 + T lymphocyte responses [53] . We have achieved this through CD40-mediated delivery of Ad5 vectors to DC in situ. Over the past decade we have explored different CD40-targeted Ad5 (CD40-Ad) configurations for their efficacy in terms of (in situ) DC targeting and transduction of subsequent T cell activation and tumor protection (Fig. 2 ). In the next paragraphs the different CD40-Ad configurations will be described and pre-clinical evidence of their efficacy discussed, highlighting their pros and cons for clinical translation. Together, these observations illustrate the pre-clinical triumphs and failures that line the long and winding road to clinical translation.",12.153426627634998,8.245234196495675

Infection with human coronaviruses does not always induce long-lived antibody responses, and re-infection of an individual with the same virus is possible after an extended period of time (but only in a fraction of individuals and resulting in mild or no symtpoms), as shown in human challenge studies (Callow et al., 1990) . Antibody titers in individuals that survived SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV infections often waned after 2-3 years (Liu et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2007) or were weak initially (Choe et al., 2017) . Despite that, re-infections are unlikely in the short term. Of note, re-infections after days of recovery have been reported recently but appear to be the consequences of false negative test results (Lan et al., 2020b) . However, they could happen when humoral immunity wanes over months and years.

Because no coronavirus vaccines are on the market and no large-scale manufacturing capacity for these vaccines exists as yet (Table 1) , we will need to build these processes and capacities. Doing this for the first time can be tedious and time consuming (Figure 1 ). CEPI has awarded funds to several highly innovative players in the field, and many of them will likely succeed in eventually making a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, none of these companies and institutions have an established pipeline to bring such a vaccine to late-stage clinical trials that allow licensure by regulatory agencies, and they do not currently have the capacity to produce the number of doses needed. An mRNA-based vaccine, which expresses target antigen in vivo in the vaccinee after injection of mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, co-developed by Moderna and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health, is currently the furthest along, and a phase I clinical trial recently started (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04283461). Curevac is working on a similar vaccine but is still in the pre-clinical phase. Additional approaches in the pre-clinical stage include recombinant-proteinbased vaccines (focused on the S protein, e.g., ExpresS2ion, iBio, Novavax, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Queensland, and Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals), viral-vectorbased vaccines (focused on the S protein, e.g., Vaxart, Geovax, University of Oxford, and Cansino Biologics), DNA vaccines (focused on the S protein, e.g., Inovio and Applied DNA Sciences), live attenuated vaccines (Codagenix with the Serum Institute of India, etc.), and inactivated virus vaccines (Figure 1 ; Table 1 ). All of these platforms have advantages and disadvantages (Table 1) , and it is not possible to predict which strategy will be faster or more successful. Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (Johnson & Johnson, 2020) and Sanofi (2020) recently joined efforts to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, J&J is using an experimental adenovirus vector platform that has not yet resulted in a licensed vaccine. Sanofi's vaccine, to be made using a process similar to the process used for their approved Flublok recombinant influenza virus vaccine (Zhou et al., 2006) , is also months, if not years, from being ready for use in the human population.

Combined, these findings suggest that FcyRII is important for ADE mediation in some types of immune cells during SARS-CoV infection. Some antibodies are capable of increasing virus replication efficiency by either boosting the uptake of infectious antibody-virus complexes, or by increasing the synthesis of viral proteins and nucleic acid [23] .

Interestingly, i.d. injection of untargeted Ad5 resulted in higher total transgene expression levels in the LN (a clear sign of successful ablation of the natural Ad5 tropism upon CD40retargeting), which was mostly attributable to transduction of macrophage-like cells in the marginal sinuses (Fig. 5A,B) . In contrast, CD40-targeted Ad5 preferentially transduced CD11c + DC in the paracortical areas (Fig.5C,D) .

However, recent vaccine development efforts related to emerging infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola virus and Zika virus vaccines), reveal significant ongoing challenges. Notably, designing and financing phase II and III clinical trials for new vaccines remains a major hurdle, with a reliance on large companies to assume the high costs and risks for an uncertain reward. With demand from relative few vaccine buyers (i.e., oligopsony) for low prices for vaccines, the incentives for vaccine development for the relatively few large vaccine suppliers (i.e., oligopoly) do not compare favorably with other opportunities for investment in development [112] . The successful development of MenAfriVac vaccine for Africa demonstrates the potential and the necessity for partnerships (e.g., public-private) to share risk and costs [112] . In addition, in the U.S., financing of programs to assure recommended vaccines for adults achieve high uptake remains a challenge that limits incentives to develop vaccines for adult markets. The Affordable Care Act removed one financial obstacle to vaccine uptake among adults by requiring insurers cover all ACIP recommended vaccines, but if altered may further detract from incentives to develop vaccines for adults. A further problem deals with the development of ''niche"" vaccines targeting a small population, which may not provide the market stimulus needed for manufacturers to accept the risks and undertake the high costs of development without some form of risk and cost sharing. Innovations in vaccine delivery technologies appear particularly difficult to develop, because the development pathway will likely lead to increased costs per dose of vaccine, and countries continue to demand increasingly lower costs for vaccines. In developing countries, the lack of adequate health infrastructure also limits the full utilization of vaccines globally. In addition, the requirement for highly-trained personnel to administer vaccines represents a continuing challenge for global vaccine development and global health [113] .

Whether the current efforts being mounted to address the Ebola outbreak in West African are successful will depend heavily on engagement and collaboration with the people in the affected communities.

These vaccines work mainly by eliciting functional antibodies that can (i) neutralize viral invasion, (ii) neutralize bacterial toxins and (iii) induce opsono-phagocytosis or complement-mediated killing of bacteria (Germain, 2010) . It has also been possible to develop effective vaccines to prevent pathogens that have a moderate degree of antigen variability and exist in multiple strains. The problem has been solved by developing multivalent vaccines, which combine multiple antigens, each directed against one strain or serotype, in the same formulation. Four different virus-like particles that elicit neutralizing antibodies have been assembled in one HPV vaccine (Pomfret et al., 2011) . In the case of bacterial pathogens, polysaccharides derived from the capsule of various strains have been conjugated to protein carriers and mixed in the same vaccine. Multivalent glycoconjugate vaccines have been developed for Pneumococcus (7-valent; 10-valent and more recently a 13-valent vaccine) (Prymula and Schuerman, 2009; Duggan, 2010) and for Menigococcus (two 4-valent vaccines have been licensed for A, C, W and Y serotypes) (Pace, 2009) . A glycoconjugate strategy could not be adopted for Meningococcus serotype B because its capsular polysaccharide is similar to a self antigen. In this case traditional techniques were unable to identify a universal vaccine against all MenB strains, and a novel approach based on genomic information called reverse vaccinology has been applied as described in detail in the next paragraph (Giuliani et al., 2006) . Traditional vaccines have been also able to prevent diseases caused by pathogens, such as Influenza (flu), that are not only present in different strains or clades, but change the antigenic target of neutralizing antibodies (haemagglutinin, HA) at every season. In this case the problem has been solved by producing a trivalent vaccine and by changing the composition of the vaccine every year. However a flu vaccine with increased breadth would greatly help the manufacturing process and increase vaccine efficacy. Some investigators have suggested various strategies to develop a universal flu vaccine, capable of preventing infection by all existing flu strains (Nabel and Fauci, 2010; Dormitzer et al., 2011) .

Significant levels of co-circulation of both influenza B lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata) and lineage mismatch between the vaccine and circulating lineage was reported for Brazil in five influenza seasons (2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013) . [42] [43] [44] Previous studies suggest that even with a partial mismatch over the years, due to the unpredictability of influenza B lineage circulation, the disease burden (in terms of clinical cases, hospitalizations and health care resource utilization) and societal burden can be considerable. 2, 9 For example, a mismatch in the 2007-2008 influenza season in the United States was estimated to have costed health care providers and society well over $100 million and $1 billion, respectively. 45 In another study conducted in Taiwan, it was reported that an epidemic predominated by influenza B/Yamagata lineage occurred during the 2011-2012 season during which the trivalent influenza vaccine contained influenza B/Victoria lineage. Expectedly, the morbidity and mortality of this vaccine mismatched epidemic was substantial (influenza B: 60.7% and 66.9% of confirmed influenza cases and deaths, respectively; 87.2% of samples showed the presence of vaccine opposite lineage). 46 Surveillance data on the age distribution of influenza cases is available only for 2013. This data showed that influenza B virus was predominantly observed in younger individuals aged 5-29 years, with the highest proportions in children aged 5-9 years and 10-19 years. Even though this observation was restricted to only one year with 90% mismatch it is in line with previous reports wherein influenza B has been reported to affect more schoolchildren and the appearance of the new B lineage reinforced this pattern. 4 An implication of this finding is that children and adolescents might benefit the most from the addition of a second influenza B lineage to the seasonal influenza vaccine. Moreover, it could be useful for the entire population as it is widely considered that vaccinating children can reduce influenza illness in family members and other susceptible populations in the community by reducing the risk of exposure and subsequent influenza infection and related complications. 47 11 that influenza B-associated mortality could potentially be a valid indication of disease severity. Thus the evidence presented here for one year underscores the importance of a universal influenza vaccination strategy compared to targeted immunization as universal immunization at high vaccine coverage levels could potentially interrupt transmission reducing the occurrence of outbreaks and severe disease.",12.288139974262116,7.5125598076135205

major efforts are needed to develop new universal vaccines that stimulate broadly reactive antibodies or T-cells against conserved epitopes,0.41762019404296097,2.9050464630126953,3.176347255706787,b785cac4-7487-40ac-9456-647aadb8894d,custom_license/On the Centenary of the Spanish Flu: Being Prepared for the Next Pandemic,"1. Surveillance is a basic strategy and prerequisite for influenza control and prevention. As one of the global surveillance systems for infectious diseases of the WHO, the GISRS will maintain its leadership in international collaboration on the surveillance of the epidemiology and impact of influenza by sharing viruses for antigenic characterization and selection of suitable vaccine viruses to manufacture, regulate, and administrate/distribute influenza vaccines. 2. Although the influenza vaccine is available since 1936 (Plotkin and Plotkin 2018) and ever since vaccination is recognized as one of the best strategies to prevent influenza infection and potential complications after infection, the inoculation rate still needs to improve in developing and underdeveloped countries/regions. Another issue is that the protective effect of currently available influenza vaccines is not as high as most vaccines for other viral diseases, such as measles, polio, and hepatitis B (Osterholm et al. 2012) . Furthermore, given the substantial lead time and the lack of available vaccines ahead of any unpredictable pandemic, major efforts are needed to develop new universal vaccines that stimulate broadly reactive antibodies or T-cells against conserved epitopes to confer heterotypic protection against different subtypes of influenza viruses, or at least one subtype in humans or poultries Zhao et al. 2018) . 3. More efforts should be paid to the development of new drugs and its corresponding clinical assessment. Amantadine is not recommended anymore due to the broad resistance among H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Though oseltamivir can also induce a rapid intra-host emergence of the drug-resistant quasispecies due to the adaptation/evolution of the viruses, it is predominantly recommended in the clinic. Meanwhile, the recent development of the new target-oriented drugs against influenza, such as virus-targeted favipiravir, baloxavir, and pimodivir, and host-targeted DAS181 and nitazoxanide may revolutionize the treatment for influenza. 4. Considering the complexities and particularities of influenza, more attention should be paid to the health education and promulgation for the public. November 1, 2018, marked the first ''World Flu Day'' that was formally launched at the Asian-Pacific Centenary Spanish 1918-Flu Symposium in Shenzhen, China. The campaign was initiated and developed by Dr. George F. Gao, the Director-General of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with other leading influenza specialists (The Lancet 2018). On the centenary of the Spanish flu of 1918, the ''World Flu Day'' initiative aimed to raise public awareness about influenza, to accelerate scientific innovation and international cooperation on influenza surveillance, and to push for stronger global support on influenza prevention and control.",12.819841642729495,8.439850492122986

Due to high mortality rate and the global burden of disease, especially in children under 5 and elderly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has paid more attention to pneumococcal disease in recent years [1] . The high-cost of antibiotic therapy and increasing resistance of pneumococcus to current antibiotics, suggesting vaccination against S. pneumoniae as the best method for prevention of disease, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report (https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/about/ prevention.html). [2] . The pneumococcal vaccine development is mainly based on surface antigens, including immunogenic proteins and carbohydrates [3] . The 23-valent streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and 7, 10, or 13-valent pneumonia conjugated vaccines (PCV-7, 10, −13) are carbohydrate-based vaccines and stimulate serotype-specific immunity [4] . Up to now, the 23-valent pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine is still applied in elderly and the Pcv-7 as a routine vaccine for children in some countries; however, the vaccine does not cover some serotypes, especially in elderly. PCV10 and PCV13 as the next generation of vaccine could cover more S. pneumoniae serotypes. However, the serotype replacement strategy of pneumococcal infections causes reducing the efficacy of this group of vaccine [5] . Thus, it is necessary to design an efficient novel vaccine. The epitope-based pneumococcal vaccines are the last generation of vaccines that are in the pipeline [2] . In this context, pneumococcal surface https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2019.101446 Received 10 August 2019; Received in revised form 6 September 2019; Accepted 10 September 2019 protein A (PspA) that is located on the surface of bacteria, and choline binding protein A (CbpA), as the most crucial protective surface antigens, have been introduced as vaccine candidate [6] . Another important vaccine candidate is pneumococcal histidine triad (Pht) protein family, including PhtE and PhtD as the conserved member of Pht expressed in pneumococcal pathogenesis [7] . Other pneumococcal proteins that have shown potential as an efficient vaccine candidate and are needed for full virulence of S. pneumoniae in animal models are pneumococcal iron ABC transporters, including two lipoprotein components, PiuA and PiaA [8] . In general, the majority of epitope-based vaccines can cause induction of cellular or/and humoral immunity as well as offer a safer and more easy-produced alternative for the prevention of diseases; however, the low immunogenicity is the main disadvantage of such types of vaccines. For solving this problem, several methods have been used to enhance the immunogenicity epitopes vaccines, like prescribing the multiple doses of vaccine, adding immunostimulatory agents such an adjuvant to the vaccine [9] , and the recent strategy is applying self-assembled peptide motif including betasheets or coiled-coil structures in the epitope vaccine [10] . Besides above-mentioned strategies, incorporating universal T-helper epitopes like diphtheria toxoids (DTD) into vaccine can enhance vaccine efficacy. DTD is the most essential components of diphtheria vaccines that are widely used as a universal T-helper [11] . In some cases, the low efficacy of epitope peptide-based vaccines may be according to their fast extracellular degradation, rapid distribution from the injection site and inefficient uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [12, 13] . Several investigations have shown that linking the epitope vaccine to certain carriers (e.g., polymeric or lipidic nanostructures) can develop the efficacy of vaccine via conferring to aforesaid obstacles [13] [14] [15] . In this context, designing epitope vaccine bases on self-assembled peptide nanoparticles (SAPN) scaffold, which acts as an antigen-presenting system, is a novel strategy. Moreover, the SAPN vaccines have selfadjuvanticity, without any toxicity; in this regard, it can bypass the low immunogenicity of the epitope peptide vaccine. In this study, CD4 epitopes were selected from PiuA, PhtD antigens, and CD8 epitopes were chosen from PspA, CbpA antigens of S. pneumoniae; moreover, the DTD was determined as universal T-helper compartment. All selected CD4 and CD8 epitopes were inserted between the pentamer and trimer oligomeric domains, which can construct self-assembled structures. Additionally, all segments were fused to each other by the appropriate linkers. The immunoinformatics and structural evaluations of the designed vaccine, showed that it can induce proper immunity against S. pneumoniae; however, experimental immunological tests should confirm the efficacy of our vaccine.",10.862383445467879,5.734917647767281

The development of an effective vaccine has been challenging; natural immunity to RSV infection is incomplete and re-infections occur in all age groups. Moreover, the primary target population for vaccination is newborns and young infants, and they are a challenging population as they have relatively immature immune systems and the presence of maternal antibodies may interfere with vaccination of the young infant (see Chapter 2 e Vaccine immunology). The initial efforts to develop a formalin-inactivated cell culture-derived RSV vaccine resulted in an unanticipated enhancement of natural RSV disease in some of the RSV-naïve infants who received the vaccine in a clinical trial and subsequently were exposed to RSV. The exacerbated disease is thought to be due to an exaggerated T helper type 2 cell immune response (see Chapter 2 e Vaccine immunology). Safety concerns regarding the potential of vaccines to trigger or prime for immunopathological responses has resulted in a cautious approach to the development of RSV vaccines. The vaccine candidates most advanced in clinical development use two different approaches e one uses a live, attenuated virus with a gene deletion deliberately targeted to minimise immunopathological responses.

Because it is assumed that local antibody is more important than humoral antibody, the feeding of colostrum containing high antibody levels against coronavirus is advantageous, and when possible, prolonged feeding of such colostrum during the first 30 days of life might confer greater protection for problem farms. Active immunization of calves at birth with multivalent products containing coronavirus (usually in combination with E. coli and rotavirus) is also quite commonly practiced but should be considered a less reliable and effective method of protecting calves compared with the absorption of high IgG 1 concentration colostrum from immunized dams.

After about 15 years of experimentation, DNA vaccines, nick named 'immunological silver bullet', have become well established in clinical trials. However, they have yet to proceed past the second phase trials primarily due to the inability to induce more potent immune responses in higher mammals. In small experimental animals, the milder host impedance has permitted the DNA vaccines to induce lasting protective effects in contrast to much tougher host barriers in large animals. Significant efforts have been put forward to identify methods of enhancing the immune response of plasmid DNA to enable its practical implementation. Prime importance has been given to develop vaccines to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. Researchers have tried a variety of immune modulators, cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules, in this regard. If the potency is improved, plasmid DNA vaccines, having numerous advantages, can be useful for the active immunization against infectious diseases of animals. Considering the current trends and myriad possibilities, efforts should be targeted towards improving their delivery or to increase their immunogenic potential. Poor cellular uptake and rapid in vivo degradation of plasmid DNA has to be taken into account and novel delivery systems has to be developed along with the optimization of the plasmid vector. The major challenge in future is the improvement of the transfection efficiency of the DNA vaccines. Gene gun and electroporation can increase transfection and improve immune responses significantly, but these technologies have not yet advanced to routine use in animals. Another promising approach is the development of microparticles as delivery systems or the non-invasive plasmid DNA immunization. Although the potency of the immune response has been weak while using topical application methods, stratum corneum disrupting agents and novel adjuvants may significantly improve them. Further, the properties of DNA vaccines have to be modulated via using cationic liposomes for promoting mucosal and systemic immunity, simultaneously.

A prophylactic vaccine must also be effective at all possible portals of HIV-1 entry, especially the mucosa. 7 For this to occur, the vaccine must offer broad and durable immunity.

These consortia include major international efforts as well as efforts of individual countries, regions, and institutions including, but not limited to: the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Consortium, 8 the Center for HIV-AIDS Vaccine Immunology, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, US Military HIV Research Program, the Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery, and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. To date, however, no HIV-1 candidate vaccine has induced broadly reactive Nabs. 8 In the absence of a vaccine that can prevent infection of HIV-1, there are still many benefits to be realized from production of a therapeutic vaccine. A therapeutic vaccine would be supremely valuable if it were able to increase the titer of virus necessary for infection, increase the time to clinical manifestation of virus, control viral load after infection, and reduce secondary transmission.

To this end, universal MHC class II epitopes that span the entire allelic range of the global population can be used. Indeed, there are many studies that have demonstrated broad CD4 + activity in response to several pan-MHC class II epitopes [39] [40] [41] .",11.176730890169893,6.414714122497344

Facilitated by innovations in structure-based design, decade-long efforts have resulted in influenza vaccine candidates targeting the extracellular domain of the M2 protein, conserved regions in the HA1 domain, or the conserved HA2 stalk domain, of which particularly the latter approach appears promising for both seasonal and pandemic purposes [31] . Given that upon exposure to new strains, immune responses will be preferably directed to conserved epitopes on the stalk [32, 33] , several avenues are being explored. One of them, which takes advantage of the current manufacturing processes, entails repeated vaccination with constructs expressing chimeric HA subunits with the same conserved stalk domain, but different exotic HA heads that are never encountered by humans under natural conditions ( [34 ,35] and NCT03275389).

This translated into an overall case fatality rate of ∼10% but with mortality rates approaching 50% in the elderly. 4 Those most likely to get serious complications or die from SARS virus infection were individuals over 65 years of age or who had a chronic illness, such as, diabetes or hepatitis. SARS virus is spread by aerosol in the form of respiratory droplets or through close personal contact, being absorbed through mucous membranes. It has a typical incubation period between initial infection and development of symptoms of 3-7 days. Symptoms include a high fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, and diarrhea. Lung histology in fatal cases revealed a marked diffuse alveolar damage, inflammatory cell infiltrate, bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia. 5 Deaths resulted from respiratory, heart and/or liver failure. Infected individuals recovering from coronavirus infections may become susceptible to reinfection due to rapidly waning immunity. 6, 7 In fact, those with waning immunity may be at risk of even more severe disease upon coronavirus reinfection. 8 SARS homologous reinfection studies showed that although immune animals cleared lung virus much faster than naive animals, the incidence and severity of lung inflammation was not reduced. 9 This suggests that illness severity is not just dictated by SARS viral load but is also influenced by host factors. Given the possibility of future human outbreaks, development of a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine platform would be beneficial. In particular, lessons learned from development of SARS vaccines may also be applicable to other coronavirus infections, such as, the recently emerged Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. 10 ",11.380560221999179,6.105628470535329

Studies (Gruber et al. 1989; Turner, 1993; Van Wissen & Siebers 1993) have shown that successfully addressing psychosocial and motivational aspects of service providers' non-compliance is an important step in changing behaviors and increasing compliance with universal precautions. Providers will begin to take universal precautions seriously when they are given the necessary support. Many provider participants expressed frustration about the lack of support from their hospital for universal precautions, but the majority of providers did not fully comply with universal precautions even when given the opportunity. Interventions need to address individual providers' attitudes and emphasize that universal precautions are standard practice and not just for a special group of patients. Furthermore, the updated national Guideline has important advice about safe practices, but places too much emphasis on HIV/AIDS and not enough on universal precautions. This gives providers a false sense of security when they practice selective adherence to universal precautions and singles HIV out when there are many other infectious diseases to which providers might be occupationally exposed. The national Guideline should be revised to emphasize that precautions should be universal for all infectious diseases, and focus on compliance with using correct procedures with all patients. A better solution, as mentioned above, would be to pass a national law mandating the use of universal precautions and responsibility for providing adequate supplies for universal precautions, and to address this fundamental problem in the current health care delivery system.",12.036525504505537,5.595032082349624

Important questions remain on how best to protect elderly subjects, the most vulnerable population for lethal human coronaviruses. Another important issue is how best to provide protection against heterologous SARS virus strains. Unfortunately, with the passage of time since the SARS epidemic, funding for SARS research has dried up and some of these questions may never be answered. While the SARS epidemic was halted by quarantine measures, there is an ongoing need for a safe and effective vaccine platform that could be used in the event of future human coronavirus threats. Notably, the MERS coronavirus has emerged to become a major human threat. Unlike SARS, MERS has not been halted by quarantine procedures, creating an urgent need for a safe and effective MERS vaccine. 55 It is not yet known whether MERS vaccines will suffer from the same problems as SARS vaccines, such as, low immunogenicity and lung eosinophilic immunopathology, but this seems likely. Hence, similar strategies as described above will be required to make MERS vaccines safe and effective. MERS will almost certainly not be the last new coronavirus to cause human disease, identifying the need for ongoing research into the unique host-pathogen interactions contributing to coronavirus pathology and infection outcomes, and to develop an effective coronavirus vaccine platform.",15.876758556233348,5.459201874194816

The greatest contribution of new strains was derived from the newly discovered bat coronavirus (BtCoV), which may be the source of most, if not all, mammalian CoVs [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The high diversity of coronaviruses is attributable to three viral traits [10] . The first characteristic is the potentially high mutation rates associated with RNA replication, generally estimated as 10 -3 to 10 -5 . Surprisingly, the estimated mutation rate for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses approached 2×10 -6 [11] [12] [13] . In contrast to other RNA viruses, recent data suggests that coronaviruses encode an RNA proof-reading activity associated with the 3' to 5' exonuclease activity encoded within nsp14 [14] . It is not clear whether RNA proof-reading fidelity is altered in changing environmental settings or during virus replication under stress related conditions, but such possibilities may allow for rapid virus evolution in changing ecologic conditions [14] . Second, recombination frequencies within the coronavirus family have been calculated to be as high as 25% during mixed infection, likely the result of discontinuous RNA transcription and the presence of full length and subgenomic negative strand RNAs that allow for frequent strand switching and recombination between viral genomes and subgenomic replication complexes [15, 16] . The role of discontinuous transcription in recombination is supported by the higher rate of recombination towards the 3' ends of viral genomes and by targeted RNA recombination techniques designed to genetically manipulate the 3' end of the genome [17] . Although poorly studied, conservation of transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) sites across viral species may implicate these sequences as foci or hot spots of recombination [17] . Thirdly, as the largest of the RNA viruses at ~27-31kb, coronaviruses have both increased opportunity for change and room for modification, clearly evidenced by the presence of numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3' end of the genome [10] . These genomic characteristics allow for rapid adaptation to novel hosts, ecological niches, tissue tropism, and even generation of novel coronavirus species, as seen in the generation of FIPV type II strains from double recombination events between FIPV type I and CCoV [10] .",9.026731617964339,6.066604479850293

The HA stem domain, unlike the receptor-binding head domain, is highly conserved across influenza strains and subtypes (Nobusawa et al., 1991) .

RNA viruses that harbor extensive genetic diversity are particularly challenging candidates as they are more likely to escape the attenuation through mutation, and low-frequency mutants may escape vaccine-elicited immune responses. Attenuation of RNA viruses by increasing their replication fidelity is one possible strategy for designing live-attenuated viruses. 42 One example is a poliovirus variant with increased replication fidelity, which as a live-attenuated vaccine successfully protected mice from lethal doses of poliovirus. 66 An interesting alternative to highfidelity live-attenuated vaccine design is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus vaccine candidate that has a reduced fidelity of replication, sufficient to attenuate the virus while affording protection in a mouse model. 67 It is possible that a mutant HIV strain with increased replication fidelity could make an effective live-attenuated vaccine. However, use of a live-attenuated HIV vaccine in humans seems unlikely to become a reality due to safety and efficacy concerns. Regardless, studies of live-attenuated SIV vaccines in macaques have provided useful information on the types of immune responses necessary to prevent SIV infection, 68, 69 making an important contribution to the understanding of effective vaccine-induced immunity to HIV.",14.373496452074242,6.559407140498704

Indeed, a subset of feline coronavirus (FCoV) has been demonstrated to be a chimaera arising from recombination between an FCoV and CECoV. ""Recombinant"" was one of the spectres feared in the early weeks of the epidemic in Hong Kong. Subsequent sequencing of the genome has shown that SARS-CoV has not arisen by any recent recombination event. Notwithstanding, an appreciation of what has been learned from over half a century of studying coronaviruses helps to put SARS and SARS-CoV into perspective. Delineating the roles of the various coronavirus proteins in pathogenesis and host range has been greatly facilitated by the development of procedures to make precise modifications to the coronavirus genome: targeted recombination for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [1-4] and FCoV [1] and various ""infectious clone"" systems for HCoV-229E [5], TGEV [6, 7], IBV [73] , MHV [8] and SARS-CoV [9] .

The authors detail the complexities of developing a vaccine against a very high consequence pathogen of uncertain etiology that appears only sporadically. Evidence points toward bats as a natural reservoir of EBOV, but efforts are still underway to confirm and define the host and virus associations. Even with such information, it would be highly impractical to attempt vaccinating bats to prevent infection of humans and nonhuman primates because so little is known about the life cycles of the many different species of bats in EBOV endemic regions. Thus, the most likely targets of an EBOV vaccine are at risk laboratory workers and individuals in areas where an epidemic is occurring. In addition, because EBOV and related filoviruses are considered to be biological warfare or bioterrorism threats, efforts have been made to develop a vaccine that could be stockpiled for use in such events. An another vaccine target population is endangered great apes, which appear to be as susceptible to EBOV disease as humans. To date, several vaccine candidates against EBOV have shown promise in laboratory studies, although none have yet progressed toward licensure. As licensure will depend on studies conducted under the Food and Drug Administration's 'Animal Rule' which is described in the paper by Burns, reliable animal models must also be developed.",11.42083829266529,6.405106564044408

It is accepted that the ubiquitin/ISG15 deconjugating activity of these membranebound viral PLpros plays a role in promoting viral replication in the host by deconjugating ISG15-and ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in the infected cell [23] , contributing to downregulation of innate immune functions [44] . However, the identities of the ubiquitin/Ublconjugated substrates whose deconjugation by viral PLpros are essential for pathogenicity remain ill defined. Whether they cleave ubiquitin or Ubl conjugates from viral proteins (i.e., to spare them from degradation by the proteasome or remove the ISG15 mark that each newly synthesized protein receives [15] ), or cellular substrates (i.e., to dampen the host immune response by deconjugating signaling molecules [21, 25] ), or both, within the vicinity of the membrane environment remains unknown, as most studies have been performed using over-expression systems relying on model pro-inflammatory substrates. It is also currently unknown to what extent deISGylation and/or deubiquitination activities contribute to pathogenesis. Thus, identifying viral PLpro mutants that can differentiate between ubiquitin and ISG15 recognition and cleavage are of considerable interest. Interestingly, mutations in PLpros that affect global Ubl-deconjugation, but not viral polypeptide processing, have been recently described [33, 34] , which could aid in the development of attenuated viruses for coronavirus vaccine development. It would also be of interest to determine whether the two PLpro enzymes can be functionally swapped between the two viruses to determine whether coronavirus infection merely requires an active processing protease/isopeptidase or if substrate specificity of that protease is a key factor. With reverse genetics systems for coronaviruses in place [45] that have been used to uncover the function of SARS proteins in viral pathogenesis [46] , together with the rapid development of the full-length MERS hCoV genome as a bacterial artificial chromosome system [47] , it may be possible to answer these questions in the near future.",10.20753488164487,5.590288486356237

The past two years, however, have seen the opening of a new frontier in coronavirus reverse genetics, with reports of the assembly of infectious cDNAs for TGEV (Almazµn et al. 2000; Yount et al. 2000) , HCoV-229E , IBV (Casais et al. 2001) , MHV , and SARS-CoV (Yount et al. 2003) . These recent developments raise the question of whether targeted RNA recombination will retain interest only as an historic relic. We think that this is unlikely to be the case. It is more probable that each reverse genetic system will have its own specific advantages under a particular set of experimental circumstances. At this moment, one can only tentatively comment on the relative strengths and limitations of targeted RNA recombination and infectious cDNAs for coronavirus reverse genetics. The targeted recombination system is at a fairly mature stage of development. By contrast, work with the infectious clone systems is sufficiently early in exploring their potentiality that it is not clear how hardy or manipulable these systems may become.",12.78642002355739,5.317159177999591

Vaccines may be liveattenuated, inactivated or recombinant virus-like particle (VLP) type. With influenza there are so many different strains that finding a traditional vaccine against all types poses a perennial problem. Based on global surveillance data generated by WHO's in- It has therefore been a lingering quest to develop a universal flu vaccine that could act against all strains of the virus all the time. There have been claims off and on of a universal flu vaccine, but to date no such vaccine has been marketed. We undertook a graphical and numerical analyses of 514 strains of the H5N1 and 425 strains of the H1N1 influenza virus neuraminidase gene and determined six regions which remained conserved (Ghosh et al. 2010) . This was facilitated by our examination of the graphical representation of the neuraminidase gene sequence which showed a strongly conserved 50/51 base (17 aa) region near the 3 0 end of the gene. When examined in the 3D crystallographic structure of the protein, this region was seen to be responsible for the bonding between the adjacent proteins in the neuraminidase quaternary structure and therefore extremely important for the structure's stability. The other regions we identified as being conserved also turned out to be surface exposed. These observations indicated a possibility, albeit subject to experimental verification, of designing inhibitors for broad-spectrum pandemic control of flu viruses with similar NA structure that could remain active for many generations of mutations of the underlying neuraminidase gene sequences (Ghosh et al. 2010) . In another exercise, we explored the HA protein of H7N9 influenza virus using an improved protocol since there were concerns that the H7N9 could mutate to a human-infecting virus. We determined several targets in both the HA1 and HA2 regions of the hemagglutinin that could be used for rational design of peptide vaccines (Sarkar et al. 2015) . It is to be noted that the HA1 of the hemagglutinin is highly variable, but HA2 is comparatively much more stable and is one of the targeted regions for a universal flu vaccine.",15.003921957441873,8.74500444141035

What are the best strategies for controlling rabies around nascent foci that have jumped even the most effective barriers by LDT? Efforts to contain an epidemic can be enhanced by using natural barriers and areas where dispersal is naturally slowed. Our models suggest that vaccine baits might be most effective at containing the spread if distributed along river banks in lightly forested areas, those with less than 12% forestation. But, the unanswerable questions are how effective can natural or vaccine enhanced-barriers be and for how long can we expect them to remain effective when given the calculus of LDTs? LDT events were common in Connecticut, but many did not spread rabies to other townships. LDT events remain unpredictable, but may be discovered early by good surveillance.

A region of -turns, occupying a prominent position about 100 residues downstream of the HVR (V1) was conserved among all strains examined. This region, also conserved in amino acid sequence, was predicted to be a strongly antigenic region.

PEDV is an alpha-coronavirus replicating primarily in porcine intestinal cells. PEDV vaccines are available in Asia and Europe, and conditionally-licensed vaccines recently became available in the United States but the efficacies of these vaccines in eliminating PEDV from swine populations are questionable. In this study, the immunogenicity of a subunit vaccine based on the spike protein of PEDV, which was directly targeted to porcine dendritic cells (DCs) expressing Langerin, was assessed. The PEDV S antigen was delivered to the dendritic cells through a single-chain antibody specific to Langerin and the targeted cells were stimulated with cholera toxin adjuvant. This approach, known as ""dendritic cell targeting,"" greatly improved PEDV S antigen-specific T cell interferon-␥ responses in the CD4 pos CD8 pos T cell compartment in pigs as early as 7 days upon transdermal administration. When the vaccine protein was targeted to Langerin pos DCs systemically through intramuscular vaccination, it induced higher serum IgG and IgA responses in pigs, though these responses require a booster dose, and the magnitude of T cell responses were lower as compared to transdermal vaccination. We conclude that PEDV spike protein domains targeting Langerinexpressing dendritic cells significantly increased CD4 T cell immune responses in pigs.

In recent years, methods developed for immunogen design have resulted in significant preclinical progress towards a universal influenza vaccine. Even though such a vaccine has not yet been deployed, many recently developed approaches could nonetheless provide substantial improvements in breadth of protection over existing licensed vaccines. In aiming for universal protection, it will be vital to determine the best possible ways to redirect immune responses towards conserved regions of influenza antigens, including the RBS and stem of HA and possibly more unexplored regions on the neuraminidase and M2 proteins. New approaches to immunogen design, enabled by the development of new technologies, will be needed to achieve the breadth of responses against these conserved regions required to provide universal protection. Better knowledge of convergent antibody lineages and additional experience designing antigens that target them to give rise to bNAbs is expected to improve current approaches. Rigorous exploration of new methods for antigen display using self-assembling scaffolds has the potential to further amplify responses targeting these conserved regions, and the ability to design novel self-assembling protein platforms should make it possible to tailor them to maximize the potency and durability of humoral responses. These challenges and opportunities represent a novel space to explore in conjunction with antigen design and the development of delivery technologies to induce CD8 + T cell responses or mucosal immunity in addition to targeted antibody responses. With respect to influenza in particular, it will be essential to understand how preexisting immunity influences responses to novel immunogens, and how the vaccine design process can best accommodate these effects.",14.384413803660333,7.162561332946232

Before being controlled by quarantine measures, ~8000 humans were infected, with fatality as high as 50 % in the elderly and an overall case fatality rate of ~10 % [ 2 ] . More recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) has caused a series of serious and, in some cases, fatal human infections [ 3 ] . Given the risk of future serious human coronavirus outbreaks, development of a suitable vaccine platform to protect against such viruses is a major priority. These vaccines present several challenges including the rapidity with which these outbreaks develop and hence the need for rapid vaccine manufacture. Hence, a successful coronavirus vaccine platform must overcome multiple challenges. SARS CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus 29.7 kb in length with 14 open reading frames [ 4 ] . Initial SARS vaccine candidates were produced from inactivated virus. Inactivated whole-virus vaccines provided only modest protection, inducing low-neutralizing antibody titers that did not protect against infection but were associated with faster lung clearance of virus [ 5 ] . However, immunization of mice with inactivated vaccines either alone or formulated with alum adjuvant resulted in severe lung eosinophilic pathology in response to virus challenge [ 6 -9 ] , similar to enhanced lung pathology seen with SARS virus reexposure after primary infection [ 10 ] . Hence a major challenge when developing a SARS vaccine is to identify strategies to avoid lung eosinophilic pathology.",14.814637599332467,6.546943458199667

However, reports of immunopathologic reactions in older mice and in non-human primates vaccinated with SARS-CoV vaccines that were subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [57, 59, 62, 64] have revealed two concerns about proceeding to clinical trials with SARS-CoV vaccines. First, there is a precedent for coronavirus-vaccine associated disease enhancement; kittens immunized with a vaccinia virus vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus vaccines developed severe disease when they were subsequently infected with FIPV [65] . In these kittens, non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies facilitated viral entry into macrophages. The concern that is extrapolated from the FIPV vaccine experience to human SARS-CoV vaccines is whether vaccine recipients will develop more severe disease if they are exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV after neutralizing antibody titers decline. The second concern is whether recipients of a SARSCoV vaccine would be at risk of developing pulmonary immunopathology following infection with an unrelated human coronavirus e.g. 229E, OC43, HKU1 or NL63 that usually causes mild, self limited disease. Although findings from preclinical evaluation have revealed these concerns, studies in animal models may not be able to provide data to confirm or allay these concerns. Factors to consider when selecting an animal model. Animal models should be tailored to the goals of the study. If the primary goal is to elucidate pathogenesis, the model should replicate key aspects of the disease and immunological reagents should be available. The demographic background (e.g. age for SARS) of the animal should be taken into consideration. In contrast, animal models used in vaccine/antiviral efficacy studies must demonstrate meaningful differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated control groups. Special consideration should be given to how animals from different demographic backgrounds respond to the vaccine/antiviral under investigation. To determine the correlate of protection, it is necessary to study the immune response to the vaccine as well as the immune response elicited after challenge with the homologous coronavirus. It may be of interest to evaluate the response to challenge with other coronaviruses that the vaccinated host may encounter. Gretebeck Table 1 Coronaviruses associated with disease in humans.

Viral causes of gastroenteritis","The immense disease burden of viral gastroenteritis underscores the need for effective prevention strategies. Endemic rotavirus disease is clearly the most important target for prevention, and efforts to develop rotavirus vaccines were initiated many years ago when it became apparent that improvements in hygiene and sanitation were unlikely to interrupt viral transmission [Bresee, et al., 1999] , A vaccine against rotavirus was licensed for the first time in the United States in 1998 but was withdrawn a year later following strong suspicion and evidence of its association with intussusception [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999; Murphy, et al., 2001; Offit et al., Section II, Chapter 13 of this book]. Despite this setback, efforts to develop other candidate vaccines are underway, and products currently in clinical trials may be available for use in the next few years. The role of other viruses, including caliciviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses in the etiology of severe endemic gastroenteritis needs to be better defined to determine whether these viruses should be targeted for prevention through vaccination. For the prevention of epidemic viral gastroenteritis, efforts clearly need to be focused on caliciviruses. The epidemic spread of caliciviruses is facilitated by the low infectious dose (<100 viral particles), ability of the virus to survive at relatively high levels of chlorine and temperatures from freezing to 60°C, great genetic diversity, and lack of lasting immunity [Kapikian, et al., 1996] . Efforts to prevent calicivirus outbreaks currently focus on identifying and eliminating sources of contamination of food and water. Person-to-person spread of caliciviruses can be reduced by good hygiene practices but is often difficult to interrupt; consequently, outbreaks spread by this mode in institutional settings (e.g., nursing homes) often run their natural course and terminate when susceptible persons are exhausted.",11.337203507754133,5.641492115255717

Thus, binding and entry assays can be performed using the well-characterized and molecularly malleable retrovirus particle. The pseudotype allows engineering of any desired variant of the viral envelope protein being studied, and provides reporter assays for assessment of the envelope protein's ability to mediate binding, fusion, and entry.

Various expression systems are used for production of subunit vaccine candidates, such as bacteria, yeast, plant, insect and mammalian cell lines (Cox 2012; Kushnir et al. 2012; Redkiewicz et al. 2014) . While some glycosylation types can be replicated in insect and mammalian cells, yeast cells will not carry out mucin type O-glycosylation and proteins produced in bacterial cells will also lack N-glycans. Even mammalian expression systems may lack the required glycosyltransferase repertoire to glycosylate relevant sites and build up relevant structures. Although there are many successful examples of vaccines produced in aforementioned systems, there is quite a number of infectious diseases that still lack vaccine coverage due to failure of vaccine candidates to induce adequate and lasting immune responses (Grimm and Ackerman 2013) . Therefore, cell lines closer to the natural host cell type should be explored to more accurately reproduce the overall protein structure, modifications, and exposed antigenic sites for the primed immune system to be able to neutralize the naturally encountered antigen. Recently, efforts are being made to identify consensus glycosylation patterns, as well as production platforms leading to elicitation of desired immune responses and pathogen neutralization Go et al. 2017) . In contrast to fast mutating RNA viruses, DNA viruses, including herpesviruses, have relatively stable genomes and rely on other means for counteracting the host's immune system (Sanjuan et al. 2010) . It is therefore conceivable, that vaccine development should be less challenging for DNA viruses. However, most of herpesvirus-targeted subunit vaccines have failed so far. A recently developed HSV-2 vaccine lacking the main neutralizing antibody target is, however, showing great promise in mice. This vaccine evokes production of non-neutralizing antibodies to other envelope glycoproteins on infected cells, stimulating cellular NK cell immunity through engagement of Fcγ receptors (Petro et al. 2015) . In conclusion, glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins have a tremendous impact on recognition by the host, and glycosylation heterogeneity makes it very difficult to identify universal vaccine candidates. While experimental evidence is key, development of accurate bioinformatic tools to predict glycosylation and likely mutation patterns would be of big value for vaccine research. This should become possible once a substantial number of viral strains are sequenced and analyzed for glycan modifications in native contexts.",14.208063904758028,7.44217346758694

SARS 139 develop a high fever followed by severe clinical symptoms including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) at autopsy (2, 4, 9) . The containment of SARS was achieved largely through traditional quarantine and sanitation measures (9,10). Since SARS is a newly emerging disease and the first coronavirus-mediated disease, a safe and effective vaccine was not available, nor was an established anti-coronavirus therapeutic (11) . Candidate vaccines became possible only once the causative virus was identified; efforts already have advanced to monkey models and clinical testing, spanning many approaches from attenuated and modified vaccinia virus, MVA (12), recombinant parainfluenza virus, BHPIV3 (13), inactivated whole virus (11), to DNA vaccines (14) . However, these rapid advances require rigorous and lengthy studies (15), illustrating the difficulty in using vaccine development to offer rapid solutions for new emerging infectious diseases. To treat SARS patients, combinations of existing drugs have been developed including ribavirin, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids, and immune stimulators, and this approach had achieved some clinical successes ( [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Many ongoing efforts to develop SARS-specific drugs such as screening of small molecule inhibitors and current biological approaches will clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, based on the ultimate success rate, and the time and cost incurred. The identification of SCV as the causative pathogen of SARS was critical for containment and patient management. This was achieved mainly by demonstration that exposure of cynomolgus macaques to SCV resulted in similar symptoms to those of SARS patients (1,2) while also creating the first animal disease model critical not only for understanding SARS pathogenesis but also for evaluating potential vaccines and novel therapeutics (13) and was followed by the development of several others (12, 14, 17, 22) .",10.778000844823886,6.676341097213476

As highly pathogenic avian influenza type H5N1 and heterologous influenza strains seem to be on the rise, Prabakaran and colleagues (61) developed a universal H5N1 vaccine candidate with broad coverage for pandemic preparedness. The HA genes of the A/Vietnam/1203/04, A/Indonesia/CDC669/06, and A/Anhui/01/05 (H5N1) strains were selected based on the neutralizing epitopes in HA covering most variants in the H5N1 clades. All three were inserted into deletion site 3 of MVAtor (Emergent BioSolutions, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), each under the control of a separate promoter (PsynI, PsynII, H5), resulting in the trivalent MVAtor-tri-HA. As a control, rMVAtor carrying only the A/Vietnam/1203/04 gene was constructed. Mice (BALB/c) immunized intramuscularly with a two-step protocol (day 0 and day 28) of 100 l of 8 ϫ 10 7 TCID 50 of MVAtor-tri-HA exhibited significant hemagglutination inhibition titers for the homologous viruses and the heterologous H5N1 clades, whereas the monovalent candidate induced only poor hemagglutination inhibition titers. A challenge experiment (ten 50% minimal lethal doses [MLD 50 ] intranasally) with a homologous clade 1 (RG-A/Vietnam/1203/04) and heterologous clade 7 (RG-A/chicken/Shanxi/2/06) H5N1 virus showed that the MVtor-tri-HA vaccine candidate conferred complete protection from weight loss and death in the immunized mice. In contrast, a previous experiment had shown that the monovalent counterpart conferred only 66% protection against the homologous H5N1 strain. Cross-clade immunity against 20 heterologous H5N1 clades was confirmed after a serological surveillance study in guinea pigs that were vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine candidate. The authors concluded that the robust and broadly neutralizing activity of their MVAtor-tri-HA vaccine candidate may also protect from yet unknown H5N1 strains. The poxviral vector seems to be an excellent delivery vehicle, as it has been proven safe and efficient in many monovalent recombinant vaccine candidates (61) .",10.832272146267899,5.975749406162026

Further development of MERS-CoV and other CoV vaccines thus needs proactive collaborative efforts from researchers filling knowledge gaps, and market stakeholders providing funding for this costly process. The latter can be insufficient and/or unsustainable, therefore hindering development of even some promising candidates. In an initiative aiming at accelerating vaccine R&D process by providing sustained funding to be prepared for future epidemics, the World Economic Forum launched the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) [80] . CEPI is an international non-profit association aiming at removing barriers facing vaccine development for epidemic infections and getting ready for future epidemics, including MERS-CoV. However, we still face a number of challenges despite the fact that various promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidates are currently available. There is a lack of animal models mimicking the disease in humans in which vaccine platforms can be tested prior to human use. We need to take into account the populations to target with vaccination, with camels and camel handlers being the most relevant ones. The lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis and immune responses to the virus in humans and camels, which is crucial for vaccine development, also needs further investments. In addition, the longevity of immune responses post-vaccination has not been evaluated for vaccine candidates, which is important for the vaccination scheme development and for the choice of the best candidates for further development. Lastly, most of the vaccine candidates are developed against the highly variable spike protein and thus may not be able to provide protection against CoV strains evolving in the future. A more targeted vaccination approach aiming at conserved epitopes should be considered for the development of a more broadly-acting CoV vaccine. Given the propensity of CoVs to jump the species barrier, current efforts to develop a MERS-CoV vaccine may also be of benefit to prepare for potential novel CoVs that may emerge in the future.",13.530827127929378,7.532889025472151

However, evidence for cross reactive immune responses against different CoVs is limited to a few studies. Convalescent SARS-CoV patient sera weakly neutralized MERS-CoV [75] and SARS-S reactive antisera showed low level neutralization of MERS-CoV [61] . Extra-RBD S1 or S2 epitopes could be responsible for this effect, as some neutralizing epitopes have been identified in these regions of the S protein [58, 62] . These may not be as immunodominant as the RBD epitopes but could provide a rationale for the development of a cross protective CoV epitope-focused vaccine. A recent study also demonstrated the potential role of adaptive response against N protein in protection against MERS-CoV infection as this vaccine candidate produced a protective T-cell response against MERS-CoV challenge which was also partially protective against SARS-CoV [27 ] . Moreover, infection of mice with SARS-CoV reduced MERS-CoV titers 5 days p.i. upon challenge suggesting the development of a cross reactive T-cell response [26] . Thus, mapping and focusing the immune response towards these critical neutralizing and T-cell epitopes, which could be subdominant, may provide a way to induce immune responses with a broader activity against different CoVs. Immune focusing may also be beneficial for the generation of a robust virus-specific immune response. As during vaccine preparation, some epitopes which are normally hidden in the full length protein structure get exposed. Some epitopes could be immunodominant and have a negative contribution on the overall neutralization capacity produced by the vaccine [76 ] . This also holds true for some non-neutralizing immunodominant epitopes, as S1-based vaccines induced slightly higher neutralization than whole S ectodomain-based ones [58, 53] . Additionally, the RBD induced higher neutralizing antibodies compared to an S1 subunit vaccine [48] , and shorter regions of RBD induced even higher neutralization responses [66] , indicating that additional regions inducing non-neutralizing antibodies may contribute negatively to the overall neutralization response produced. Additionally, antibody-dependent enhancement of the viral infection by non-neutralizing antibodies [77] [78] [79] , despite not being reported so far for MERS-CoV, needs also to be taken into consideration when developing a coronavirus vaccine. One approach to enhance the efficacy of subunit vaccines is to mask those negativelycontributing epitopes through glycosylation [76 ] . Other approaches are immunefocusing and epitope-based vaccines, all aiming at narrowing the immune response to target only critical or beneficial epitopes to produce a stronger protective response. A prerequisite to reach that goal is to map epitopes targeted by the immune system and identify their biological role as being neutralizing, non-neutralizing, infection enhancing, containing a Tcell epitope, and so on. This can be achieved by analyzing the activity and fine specificity of convalescent patient sera, infected animal polyclonal sera, monoclonal antibodies, animal and human PBMCs. Subsequently the predicted epitopes can also provide a basis for potential vaccine candidates when produced as nanoparticles or VLPs. Further characterization of the immune responses induced by these vaccine candidates when evaluated in an animal model may be utilized to optimize the vaccines for efficacy (Figure 1 ). This epitope-focused vaccine approach may allow for targeting less immunodominant B-and T-cell epitopes having broader protection, avoid eliciting immune responses against epitopes playing no role in protection or having a negative or harmful role. In addition to better targeting of protective immunodominant epitopes, a combination of those epitopes, B-and Tcell epitopes targeting different viral proteins, could be used to produce a broader and stronger protective immune response for both strain-specific and universal CoV vaccines.",11.125548085870346,5.792280764833788

Results showed that both SARS coronavirus strains have high genetic stability, although nearly 10 generations were passed. Four nucleotide variations were observed between the second passage and the 11th passage of Sino1 strain for identification of SARS inactivated vaccine. Moreover, only one nucleotide was different between the third passage and the 10th passage of Sin03 strain for SARS inactivated vaccine. Therefore, this study suggested it was possible to develop inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV in the future.",11.701460653874276,5.111816440042405

These results may be particularly useful to target the growing number of efforts to discover and characterize new pathogens before they emerge in human populations, coupled with efforts that identify potential zoonotic pathogen reservoirs and specific high-risk behavior in a region. Our results could be compiled into a catalogue of relevant transmission pathways and reservoirs. Targeting pathogen discovery through this approach could tell us new information about how likely a newly discovered potentially zoonotic pathogen is to emerge. Public health efforts could develop control strategies that focus on behavioral change in high-risk populations to minimize exposure to potential reservoirs and target relevant transmission pathways (e.g., personal protective behaviors for direct animal contact pathway, vector control targeted at larval mosquitos, use of bed nets, etc., for the vector-borne pathway). This approach will allow zoonotic disease surveillance to shift toward a more preemptive strategy and use more targeted public health interventions to prevent zoonotic disease spillover and emergence.

During this period, the field has had some very difficult times. Recently, however, several important technical improvements in their design, formulation, synthesis and delivery, as listed in this article, have now contributed to a recent resurgence of interest as they have started to exhibit improved performance in larger animals and in the clinic. The concept of DNA vaccination has been studied against a wide array of pathogens and tumor antigens, both in preclinical and clinical stages, with clear measures of progress. However, only a few bacterial pathogens have been targeted by DNA vaccines. Although antibiotics and conventional vaccines have been useful in the past, the emergence of resistant strains of bacterial pathogens has become a major roadblock in the clinic. Clinical trials in a number of countries with conventional vaccines like BCG, the TB vaccine, for example, have revealed a very heterogeneous degree of protection, ranging from 0 to 80%. Similar disappointments have been seen in cases of several other bacterial pathogens. Recently, the paradigm of protection generated by DNA vaccines, which hitherto relied mainly on the generation of cellular immunity, is now shifting to incorporate the contribution of humoral components of immune protection against such pathogens. Accordingly, these vaccine approaches have renewed interest against bacterial pathogens. Specifically, DNA vaccines are being developed against mycobacterium species, including Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium ulcerans among other targets, through the availability of suitable murine models to test vaccine efficacy. With the effort to translate these studies to humans, the next 5 years of testing will be crucial for the generation of clinical success based on immune potency. Improved vaccine design, including better formulation, better delivery techniques and incorporation of adjuvants, supported by the joint efforts of research organizations, industries and regulatory authorities, could finally pave the way towards successful DNA vaccines against bacterial pathogens in the not too distant future.",10.328237001640806,3.445252646595362

Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome sequence of the SARS-CoV suggests that it is not closely related to any of the three previously identified coronavirus groups, nor does it seem to be a reassortant of known coronaviruses [12] . Its unique sequence suggests that the virus has evolved independently from the other members of the family for a long period of time. The search for a possible natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV is ongoing, since it could serve as the launch pad for another SARS outbreak. To date, these efforts have limited success because a virus with very close sequence homology was isolated from palm civets, raccoons, dogs, and the Chinese ferret badger, indicating that the virus may have jumped recently from these mammals to humans [13] . Cats may be infected with the virus and can spread it, but do not show clinical signs of infection [14] . Moreover, the virus has been detected on the body-surface and gut contents of cockroaches by PCR, but their organs were negative, so they might act as a mechanical vector of virus transmission [15] . The pandemic potential and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, as well as the absence of effective licensed drugs, highlights the need for aggressive efforts directed toward the development of a safe and effective vaccine. The availability of a prophylactic vaccine would be a particularly desirable solution, since it would not only prevent disease in vaccinated people, but it would also reduce overall spread of the virus. While the development of coronavirus vaccines generally has [11, 148]) been challenging, there are several encouraging factors which point towards the feasibility of developing a SARS-CoV vaccine: (1) the evidence that SARS-CoV is inducing an acute infection and disease (it is generally more complicated to develop a vaccine against a microorganism that induces a chronic infection); (2) the infection mounts a strong humoral response; (3) passive transfer of sera obtained from convalescent patients to SARS patients resulted in the reduction of the viral load that saved the lives of the patients; (4) the relative ease with which the virus can be propagated in vitro; and (5) as a proof of concept there are some effective licensed veterinary coronavirus vaccines based on inactivated or live attenuated virus, including those against a canine coronavirus and avian infectious bronchitis virus.",11.76788968352972,2.4147784660555374

This approach is also being used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, insulin resistance, and even multiple sclerosis [86] .With the strong evidence that the host microbiome influences immunological responses, the next logical step is to investigate the influence of the microbiome on vaccine-induced immunity. For example, if a specific microbial community is associated with a robust response to vaccine, then perhaps, research can focus on potential adjuvants derived from the microbial community. Studies have begun to characterize the lung microbiome after influenza infection [87, 88] . Insight into the relationship between the commensal and pathogenic microbes present after influenza infection may help in the synthesis of novel vaccine and therapeutics against influenza. Influenza virus is known to alter and facilitate the growth dynamics of certain bacterial species, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus [89, 90] . These species are the major etiological contributors of secondary pneumonia after influenza infection. In the future, a personalized vaccine may be targeted at influenza and at those bacterial species known to have an increased growth potential after infection.

First, as an RNA virus, it replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm of the infected cells without a DNA stage, making integration of viral sequence into the host genome unlikely. Second, it is the largest RNA virus with a genome size of around 30 kb and a cloning capacity of more than 6 kb is therefore expected (Enjuanes et al., 2005) . Third, coronavirus displays a unique transcription process involving transcription of a nested set of 6-8 subgenomic mRNA species. Heterologous genes can be expressed simply by inserting them with an appropriate TRS into the virus genome, as demonstrated for MHV (Fischer et al., 1998) , SARS-CoV (Sims et al., 2005) and IBV (Le et al., 2007; Youn et al., 2005) . Fourth, coronavirus host specificity and tropism could be altered readily by exchange of the S gene between viruses of different host origin (Casais et al., 2003; Sanchez et al., 1997) . Therefore, it is possible to engineer the tissue and species tropism to target expression to different organs and animal species, including humans. Fifth, it may be used to express multiple genes, as demonstrated by the possibility of constructing coronavirus-based HIV multigene vaccine (Eriksson et al., 2006; Thiel et al., 2003) . Finally, the mucosal route is the natural way of coronavirus transmission. In this study, efforts were made to explore the possibility of developing coronavirus IBV as gene delivery vectors and multivalent vaccines. In this study, a number of infectious recombinant IBV carrying foreign genes with variable degrees of genetic stability were obtained by insertion of reporter genes or host and other viral genes at different positions of the IBV genome.

The use of this vaccine world-wide led to the World Health Organization's eradication campaign in 1967.

The development, licensure, and use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the 1950s led to an 86% decrease in polio cases. [2] This was followed by the development and use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the 1960s with further reductions in the incidence rate of the disease. Together, these vaccines have prevented millions of cases of polio and its associated crippling effects. The phenomenal success of these vaccines led the WHO to adopt the goal of global polio eradication. Polio rates have decreased by 99% since the eradication efforts started with only a few hundred cases per year, mostly in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and neighboring countries.

(4) What are the advantages and disadvantages of replicating agents (e.g., live, attenuated human or animal rotaviruses, rotavirus reassortants, or vectors expressing individual rotavirus proteins) as compared to nonreplicating agents (e.g., inactivated virus, purified virus proteins, or peptides) as candidate rotavirus vaccines?",10.102085816416245,4.696253714108055

Attenuation of IBV by multiple passages (over 100) in embryonated eggs can delay a new vaccine's clinical availability for several years.

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, basic research on coronaviruses and advances in vaccine preparation technology can significantly shorten the development time of new coronavirus vaccines.

Since the circulating influenza viral strains tend to change each influenza season, vaccine scientists, manufacturers and policy makers attempt to anticipate these strains prior to the influenza season and incorporate them into the vaccine. Predicting the dominant strain(s) can be difficult, so the vaccine's strains do not always match the circulating ones. Consequently, annual vaccine protection tends to vary and persist only through a single influenza season/year. Therefore, scientists have been attempting to develop a vaccine that protects over multiple years, regardless of shifting circulating strains and antigenic drift [10] . Such a vaccine would target a 'universal' or conserved portion of the influenza virus -that is, one that persists across different strains. A multiyear vaccine would also circumvent the need for yearly immunization (and the annual compliance needed) and protect the population should a novel strain, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain, emerge. Currently, the universal vaccine is in preclinical development, as testing of vaccines targeting the influenza A M2 protein has been carried out in mouse models [10] .",13.699024845366496,8.064365642489678

An important ethical, political, and social issue in the USA in the twenty-first century is how to achieve universal access to health care. The solidarity principle of socially shared responsibility for funding universal access to health care is based on equitable prepayment for health care for all by nationally regulated mechanisms through place of work or general revenues of government. A society may see universal access to health care as a positive value, and at the same time utilize incentives to promote the use of services of benefit to the individual, such as hospital care, immunization, and screening programs. Some services may be arbitrarily excluded from health insurance, such as dental care, although this is to the detriment of children and a financial hardship for many. Strategies for program inclusion are often based on historical precedent rather than cost-effectiveness or evidence. While efforts are being made to include more children in the program, the Medicaid system in the USA defines eligibility at income levels of 185 percent of the poverty line, thus excluding a high percentage of the working poor.

Communication efforts need to be sensitive to the fact that HCWs respond to the implementation of influenza vaccination policies differently to the rest of the general population, and that even within this group, some healthcare professionals appear less susceptible to strategies to enhance compliance compared with others.

For example, many studies identify nurses as a group that is particularly resistant to influenza immunisation, 34, 55, 62 and others have targeted HCWs working in specific settings, such as nursing homes, oncology centres or paediatric units. [76] [77] [78] The focus on specific subgroups of HCWs, especially those in closest contact with high-risk populations, has been noted in the literature as an important step to a better understanding of the concerns among HCW groups. The combination of strategies that encompass all HCWs with those that target HCWs showing the least susceptibility to vaccination campaigns can be instrumental in ensuring broad vaccine coverage in different settings. 33, 49, 52, 79 Conclusion HCW compliance with influenza vaccine depends on a number of factors that come into play in the decisionmaking process. Utilitarian arguments have been used as a foundation for promoting vaccination policies in healthcare settings. However, these efforts have not improved coverage rates among HCWs, and the challenges of ensuring adherence to vaccine policies for novel influenza viruses have recently been highlighted with the emergence of the H1N1 pandemic strain in 2009. In the future, researchers should engage hospital and public authorities when planning and conducting studies to ensure that findings are translated to evidence-based policies that are in-line with the general thinking among HCWs.",11.321448940534461,4.5224461336679

In the last 5 years, live recombinant vectored vaccines have been introduced to the veterinary market (Yamanouchi et al., 1998; USDA, 2001; van Kampen, 2001) . Most notable and most widespread veterinary vectored vaccines are the rabies vaccine vectored by vaccinia, fowlpox, and canarypox viruses which are not virulent in unnatural hosts. These recombinant vectored vaccines incorporate gene sequence(s) of the targeted viral protein in the vector genome region that does not interfere with the targeted gene expression (Schnell, 2001) . The incorporated gene(s) must include genes for protective FIVepitopes and must be expressed at a suf®cient level for the vaccinated host to mount a speci®c immune response. Predominant CTL and VN antibody epitopes reside on FIV Gag proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively (Lombardi et al., 1993; Egberink et al., 1994; Flynn et al., 1995) . These viral proteins also make up over 75% of the structural proteins and contain the major epitopes for immunodiagnostics. Although vectored vaccines are generally known for their ability to generate cellular immunity compared to humoral immunity, speci®c antibodies against targeted virus can be produced using this vaccine system.

However, implementation of these responses was not always timely, and the virus eventually spread throughout the entire country. As soon as the general population began to realize the severity of the outbreak, facemask consumption surged in only a few days, partly due to the lack of information concerning the novel virus and panic buying [18] . Under these circumstances, the Chinese government made several attempts at various efforts with respect to public communication, including updating data concerning the latest facemask productivity, release of guidelines on facemask usage, stabilizing facemask prices on the market, and offering a facemask lottery in official pathways. NHC classified each province unit into different risk levels (high-, middle-, and low-risk) and implemented corresponding strategies for outbreak control on 27 Feb 2020 [33] . This strategy was similar to Scenario 2 in our analysis (universal facemask wearing policy implemented in the epicenter/high-risk region). The experience in China during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that a universal facemask wearing policy should be introduced with caution. In addition, both Hong Kong (with universal facemask wearing) and Singapore (without universal facemask wearing) experienced a slow increase in the number of new cases, indicating that a universal facemask wearing policy may not be necessary for outbreak control [34] . Given that the demand for facemasks can increase dramatically due to panicbuying, a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions may be more appropriate to prevent massive asymptomatic infection. However, without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy, even in specific regions, can result in panic throughout society and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demands for facemasks.

A combination of VFC, state/local, and Section 317 program funds (i.e., VFC only, VFC and Underinsured, VFC and Underinsured Select, Universal, and Universal Select) has been used by a number of states to purchase all recommended vaccines for children in the state, including the privately insured. 78 Many states use universal programs that expand the eligibility for VFC vaccines by supplementing VFC purchases at federally discounted prices. The universal purchase states have been successful in raising vaccination rates among the underinsured 79 and increasing access to newer and more expensive vaccines for children without insurance. 75 However, criticisms of the universal purchase programs have been raised, including (1) vaccine manufacturers' claims that universal purchase programs unfairly provide for the purchase of all vaccines at lower government contract prices, thus eliminating the private market for vaccines and decreasing revenue; (2) although immunization charges are reduced under this program, patients still pay for the vaccine administration fee; and (3) some contend that taxpayer money should not be spent to provide free vaccines for children whose insurance would otherwise pay for it. 79 State Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program funds also are provided for vaccine purchase, although the level of Medicaid funding varies from state to state.",14.265965825984576,6.334217434460316

Because Env is vastly overglycosylated compared to host glycoproteins, the glycans have become targets for the antibody response. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made in developing and validating biophysical methods to elucidate the complex structure of the Env spike glycoprotein with its combination of glycan and protein epitopes.

Examples for challenging viruses are HIV, HCV, [70] [71] [72] RSV, CMV, 73 HSV-2, 74,75 EBV, and dengue. For a variety of reasons, developing an effective vaccine against these viral pathogens has been a formidable task despite the tremendous efforts. Great amounts of resources have gone into developing a vaccine against HIV, [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] but this mission has proved to be the most arduous so far (challenges and prospects are discussed later in the chapter). As for influenza, effective vaccines against seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza virus strains have been licensed. However, these vaccines (as discussed later in the chapter) do not offer broad protection against these rapidly evolving viruses. Vaccine candidates against RSV 84, 85 and dengue 86, 87 have now entered advanced stages of clinical testing (Table 15. 2). Emerging viral pathogens include Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), hendra, nipah, Marburg, chikungunya, lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and zika viruses. Infections with most of these viruses are limited to certain endemic areas, which in turn make the decision of developing a vaccine against such viruses not an economically favorable one. However, in the wake of the 2014 massive Ebola outbreak that ravaged West Africa this perception could change. For Ebola, recent studies suggest that robust immune responses could be detected in convalescent patients, 88 indicating that developing a protective vaccine against this pathogen is doable. Indeed, many vaccine candidates have shown promising results in clinical trials. 89 Two of these candidates are ready for Phase 3 testing. 89 Other antiviral vaccines that are in advanced stages of clinical testing include vaccines developed against CMV and norovirus. 73, 90 Later in the chapter we will discuss the challenges facing developing a vaccine against HIV, influenza (universal), and RSV, and how recent technological advances could help in overcoming such challenges.",10.922973185372086,5.2470004542242545

As highly pathogenic avian influenza type H5N1 and heterologous influenza strains seem to be on the rise, Prabakaran and colleagues (61) developed a universal H5N1 vaccine candidate with broad coverage for pandemic preparedness. The HA genes of the A/Vietnam/1203/04, A/Indonesia/CDC669/06, and A/Anhui/01/05 (H5N1) strains were selected based on the neutralizing epitopes in HA covering most variants in the H5N1 clades. All three were inserted into deletion site 3 of MVAtor (Emergent BioSolutions, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), each under the control of a separate promoter (PsynI, PsynII, H5), resulting in the trivalent MVAtor-tri-HA. As a control, rMVAtor carrying only the A/Vietnam/1203/04 gene was constructed. Mice (BALB/c) immunized intramuscularly with a two-step protocol (day 0 and day 28) of 100 l of 8 ϫ 10 7 TCID 50 of MVAtor-tri-HA exhibited significant hemagglutination inhibition titers for the homologous viruses and the heterologous H5N1 clades, whereas the monovalent candidate induced only poor hemagglutination inhibition titers. A challenge experiment (ten 50% minimal lethal doses [MLD 50 ] intranasally) with a homologous clade 1 (RG-A/Vietnam/1203/04) and heterologous clade 7 (RG-A/chicken/Shanxi/2/06) H5N1 virus showed that the MVtor-tri-HA vaccine candidate conferred complete protection from weight loss and death in the immunized mice. In contrast, a previous experiment had shown that the monovalent counterpart conferred only 66% protection against the homologous H5N1 strain. Cross-clade immunity against 20 heterologous H5N1 clades was confirmed after a serological surveillance study in guinea pigs that were vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine candidate. The authors concluded that the robust and broadly neutralizing activity of their MVAtor-tri-HA vaccine candidate may also protect from yet unknown H5N1 strains.

Although personalized treatments can help save the lives of sick people, prevention applies to all. ""Precision prevention"" may be helpful in using both science and limited resources for targeting prevention strategies. For example, recent data suggest that knowing the speed with which people metabolize nicotine, based on genetic and other factors, could lead to personalized smoking-cessation interventions. Another approach to precision prevention is increased screening of people at greater risk for cancer. Family health history is an inexpensive tool for identifying individuals and families that require earlier and more intensive screening for breast and ovarian cancer. 5 Although whole genome sequencing in healthy populations will require more evidence for its utility, there is an emerging list of genomic applications that merit a targeted public health approach to find people with selected genetic conditions (e.g., hereditary breast/ovarian and colorectal cancers and familial hypercholesterolemia). Collectively, these conditions affect around 2 million people in the U.S., with evidence-based interventions that are poorly implemented in health care. 6 In addition, new biomarkers promise to improve the understanding of disease natural history. For example, epigenetics 7 is providing insights into the impact of the environment on gene expression throughout life with the possibility of targeted interventions. There is also strong suspicion that cumulative epigenetic changes due to environmental stressors may explain population health disparities in the burden of various diseases among disadvantaged populations. 8 Measuring neighborhood-specific epigenetic alterations can potentially be used to investigate causes for health disparities. However, although the field of epigenetics is promising for public health, much more work is needed in developing, validating, and using the right platforms in population studies. 8 Biomarkers are only one of many avenues for identifying high-risk populations for intervention. Public health programs already use targeted approaches, for example, by recommending screening for hepatitis C in people born from 1945 through 1965, and identifying people with prediabetes. Public health policies that will enhance lower sugar intake, weight control, and increased activity levels across the population could be accompanied, but not replaced, by more-targeted efforts to find people with prediabetes based on age, family history, and BMI. As technologies mature, there will be increasing opportunities for additional targeting for a wide variety of disease-prevention efforts.",10.475994823312986,5.490238683698257

While all industrialized countries except the United States have universal health care insurance or national health service evolving since the 19 th century (see Chapter 8); the United States is still struggling with the issue in the 21 st century. The solidarity principle of societal shared responsibility for funding universal access to health care is based on equitable prepayment for health care for all by nationally regulated mechanisms through place of work or general revenues of government. A society may see universal access to health care as a positive value, and at the same time utilize incentives to promote or place limits on use of services or benefits to the individual such as hospital care, immunization, screening programs, prescription drugs and others. Some services may be arbitrarily excluded from health insurance, such as dental care, although this is to the detriment of children and a financial hardship for many. Strategies for program inclusion are often based on historical precedent rather than cost-effectiveness or evidence.

While many diseases have been controlled or essentially eradicated owing to vaccination, the goal to generate community immunity for a wide variety of diseases remains elusive due to a number of problems associated with current vaccines . A substantial amount of time and research efforts are directed towards determining which strains of influenza (flu) to include in the flu vaccine each year. In most years the vaccine matches quite closely to the current disease-causing strains of flu, while sometimes, despite all of the research efforts, the vaccine is not a good match and fails to provide adequate protection (Duda 2014) . Since fewer flu B cases have been identified as compared to flu A cases, there are two strains of influenza A, H1N1 and H3N2, and one strain of influenza B used in the current flu vaccine. The H3N2 strain of influenza A used in the vaccine is a good match to the H3N2 strain causing the majority of flu illnesses in the United States. During the 2012/2013 flu season, there have been two illness-causing influenza B strains. One of those strains was well matched by the flu vaccine, but the other was not. Therefore, patients who were vaccinated with this season's flu vaccine are likely to be well protected, while those who happened to contract the other strain of flu B that was not part of the vaccine may not have a good protection. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, the flu vaccine has been about 61 % effective at protecting people from flu during the 2013-2014 mid-season for all age groups (CDC 2014). This number represents quite an impressive success rate for a vaccine. However, considering the emergence of new seasonal strains, the battle against flu should continue by changing the vaccine strain composition. In this regard, the development of a universal vaccine, capable of providing a broader spectrum of protection against the disease, would greatly benefit the community and is a task of highest priority. Traditional inactivated or live attenuated vaccines are fairly effective in protecting the population against seasonal flu by targeting a viral Ag, hemagglutinin (HA). However, in case of a pandemic caused by a new strain of influenza with high mortality rate in humans, such as H5N1, it is difficult to produce adequate amounts of an effective vaccine in a timely manner using the conventional egg-based production system because: (1) it takes at least 4 months to produce the first vaccine after the identification of a new potential strain (Emanuel and Wertheimer 2006) ;",13.156366992221388,8.782024787743032

Additionally, genetic variants in genes that are found in all strains can be characterized by DNA sequence analysis. This concept has been used to characterize intraspecies diversity in a novel approach for the discovery of new vaccine candidate molecules: Pangenomics reverse vaccinology (20).

However, compliance with this recommendation depends largely on availability of the appropriate vaccine in the country of residence. Unfortunately, even in years when the northern and southern hemisphere vaccines contain identical strains, the shelf life of the local ‘winter influenza vaccine’ has typically expired when travel is considered and neither the following winter season vaccine nor the opposite hemisphere vaccine are available (i.e. licensed in the country of departure). Thus, when no suitable influenza vaccine is available locally, the traveller should arrange vaccination as soon as possible after arriving at the travel destination, bearing in mind that vaccine-induced protection may take 1–2 weeks to develop.98 Furthermore, the likelihood of travellers on short-term holidays seeking out influenza vaccination in the country they are visiting is highly unlikely to happen. This approach may be particularly important in years with a significant change in formulation between northern and southern hemisphere vaccines. In some years, simply increasing the shelf-life of seasonal influenza vaccine would improve this situation. Commercial vaccines often maintain acceptable potency for many months after they have ‘expired’. In addition, efforts should be made by pharmaceutical industry and regulatory bodies to make opposite hemisphere influenza vaccines available at least for travel clinics. Obviously, success in the development of more universal influenza vaccines that would induce longer lasting and increased effectiveness would bring great benefits for the combat of influenza not only in high-risk groups but also for travellers.65,74",12.559730367368594,8.590608587639677

However, in the BALB/c mouse model, immunization of G protein expressed from recombinant vaccinia virus elicited Th2-biased responses, which was responsible for the vaccine-enhanced diseases (27). Thus, G protein has been falsely regarded as a bad target antigen for a long time, although it could induce strong neutralizing antibody responses upon immunization. Recently, it has been suggested that G protein itself is not the cause of vaccine-enhanced diseases and the proper balance between RSV-specific Th1 and Th2 responses is rather an important factor controlling both safety and efficacy of G-targeted RSV vaccine. Using appropriate platforms and/or adjuvants, this balance could be achieved with G-targeted vaccines.
