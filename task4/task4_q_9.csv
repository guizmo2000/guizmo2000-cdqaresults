In naturally occurring DENV infection, most of the produced antibodies are cross-reactive but poorly neutralizing, while serotype-specific and highly neutralizing antibodies represent only a small fraction (Fibriansah et al., 2015) . Similar to natural infection, DENV live attenuated vaccines generate cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies leading to enhanced disease (Taylor et al., 2015) . Accordingly, structural-based design of chimeric DENV vaccine that induce cross-protective neutralizing antibody response have been evaluated. The first licensed DENV vaccine, CYD-TDV, is a tetravalent live-attenuated vaccine designed of chimeras of yellow fever 17D with the four DENVs (Halstead, 2018) .

Since then, several studies have been conducted to understand ADE of influenza in vitro. Ochiai et al. found that antibodies of rabbits previously exposed to influenza mediate influenza A growth in macrophages via FcγR entry and in a concentration dependent manner (Ochiai et al., 1988 (Ochiai et al., , 1990 . Specifically, antibodies to the HA and NA proteins were shown to augment the FcγR-mediated viral uptake into antigen presenting cells (Tamura et al., 1991) . These observations were further elaborated in animal models. In a study using inactivated vaccines from two swine influenza viruses (H1N1 and H1N2) to immunize pigs, protection was achieved against homologous challenge, whilst enhanced disease was observed in heterologous challenge (Vincent et al., 2008) . Similar results were obtained using inactivated human-like H1N2 (delta-cluster) to immunize pigs (Gauger et al., 2011 (Gauger et al., , 2012 . Moreover, data from vaccinated ferret models showed that preexisting H1N1 antibodies were associated with enhanced lung disease and mortality upon infection with unmatched strain (Kobinger et al., 2010) . In another study, prior exposure of ferrets to 2008-09 H1N1 trivalent inactivated vaccine (TVI) resulted in an enhanced disease after the challenge with pandemic H1N1/09 (pdm09) virus (Skowronski et al., 2014) . In addition, vaccination of pigs with H1N1 pdm09 recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) subunit elicited high neutralizing antibodies to the homologous virus, but induced vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) in a heterologous virus challenge (Rajão et al., 2014) . Also, in a recent study, maternally derived antibodies caused enhanced respiratory disease in piglets following heterologous influenza challenge (Rajao et al., 2016) . Evidence of influenzainduced ADE was also reported in humans. Observational studies in humans showed that the 2008-09 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine could potentially enhance pandemic H1N1 infection and illness Skowronski et al., 2010) . In a direct contrast, recent work in mice to evaluate these observations showed that pre-existing non-neutralizing antibodies after administration of TIV were not associated with enhanced disease, but in fact, they were shown to promote antigen presentation and activate virus-specific CD8 T cells (Kim et al., 2016) . The difference between these observations in human and mice could be attributed to several factors including: difference in antibody types (classes) between the two species, titer of antibodies in the blood, the challenge model used in mice, and many others.",20.630243454978707,8.384148722998345

Since then, more than 2000 cases and 700 fatalities were reported worldwide (WHO, 2017) . Vaccination approaches for this virus also targeted the spike protein. Some of these vaccines were evaluated in nonhuman models and they were shown to reduce lung pathology following challenge with MERS-CoV. Nonetheless, like other coronaviruses, vaccine-induced disease enhancement is also a concern in MERS-CoV vaccine development. MERS-CoV preexisting antibodies have been recently shown to contribute in disease enhancement. In this very recent study by Houser et al (Houser et al., 2017) , researchers used New Zealand white rabbits as a model of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection to evaluate the role of primary infection in protection from reinfection. Results showed that rabbits developed non-neutralizing antibodies against MERS viral proteins, which were not only non-protective, but also induced enhanced pulmonary inflammation, without increase in viral replication. Moreover, passive transfer of serum from infected to naïve rabbits led to disease enhancement. Further investigations revealed the contribution of complement proteins in this enhanced pathology. Specifically, an increase of C3a and C9 proteins was observed, where these proteins are responsible for the release of anaphylotoxins and recruitment of immune cells, leading to inflammation (Houser et al., 2017) . In another recent study, vaccinated transgenic mice with whole inactivated MERS-CoV developed eosinophilic infiltration combined with enhanced lung disease after MERS-CoV challenge (Agrawal et al., 2016) . Despite the lack of evidence of MERS-CoV-induced ADE in humans, observations from animal studies highlight the risk of potential development of enhanced disease, including sever lung pathology, in individuals who are previously infected/vaccinated with MERS-CoV. Further, the presence of non-neutralizing cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronaviruses could contribute to MER-CoV-induced ADE. Yet, this remains unstudied and requires further investigation while developing and testing coronaviruses vaccines.",21.6283169698768,7.745091001735985

In a recent study, it was shown that more than 90% of RSV neutralizing antibodies in adult humans are directed to Pre-F, most of which targeted site Ø (Ngwuta et al., 2015) . This highlights the importance of pre-F antigen to boost or induce functional and highly potent antibody response against RSV (Ngwuta et al., 2015) . Consequently, the stabilized pre-F has been considered a promising vaccine especially for vulnerable groups including young infants, pregnant females, immunocompromised patients, and elderly. In fact, vaccination with stabilized Pre-F recombinant vaccine is being considered for pregnant women in their third trimester to boost already existing B cells and enhance transfer of maternal antibodies to newly born infants (Taleb et al., 2018) .

These reasons for non-vaccination were consistent with a previous study carried out in Korea [12] . Studies in France, Australia, the United States, and Hong Kong demonstrated that vaccine safety and side effects were the most significant barriers to vaccination, whereas fear of vaccination side effects was relatively low in Korea [14] [15] [16] [17] . This could indicate a cultural difference in the perception towards vaccination. Factors associated with pandemic influenza vaccination are important clues for increasing vaccination uptake. Aside from the high-risk group, the non-high-risk group considered receiving a notice from a public health organization the most important triggering event. A study conducted in the US reported that people who received information on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine from public health organizations or healthcare providers rather than media, or family or friends had a higher probability of being vaccinated [18] .

First, people registered as having a chronic medical disease in the Health Insurance Review Agency database received vaccination information in the mail. Second, the elderly (i.e., those aged $65 years), those known to be financially vulnerable, and nursing home residents received free vaccinations at public health centers. Third, pregnant women and people with chronic medical diseases were vaccinated at private clinics at the overall cost of 15,000 Korean won (US $14).

Planning to vaccinate all patients is similar to implementing a national vaccination campaign. Additionally, patients have various lengths of hospital stay depending on the severity of their condition. A patient visiting an emergency room for a few hours may not have the same risk for MERS as a patient staying in the hospital for days or even months. It typically takes the body a few weeks to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination [29] so vaccinating patients during an outbreak may not be effective considering that immunity would not be built in time. We propose vaccinating patients with chronic diseases that require them to have multiple encounters with healthcare facilities such as those who are diabetic, have a respiratory illness, hypertension, or heart disease. For example, In Saudi Arabia with a population of roughly 30 million people,~4.6 million annual visits are made to chronic disease clinics [30] . In the Al-Hasa outbreak, 52% of patients had end-stage renal disease, 74% had diabetes mellitus, 39% had cardiac disease, and 43% had lung disease [27] . In the Jeddah outbreak, 35% of patients had secondary exposure to MERS in the renal dialysis outpatient facility [14] . This evidence suggests a significant benefit in vaccinating patients with chronic diseases that put them at risk for MERS infection to ultimately reduce MERS transmission in healthcare settings.",12.817559029699298,7.43966098737153

Surveillance and intervention After detecting the disease for the first time in 2003, Vietnam implemented a stamping out programme for infected and at-risk flocks to control the disease [15] . However, culling 45 million poultry failed to eliminate infection and prevent human cases, so it was necessary to adapt the strategy. Surveillance information was gathered to inform the development of a vaccination campaign that aimed at complementing existing measures [16] . Vietnam's integrated national operational programme for avian influenza from 2006 to 2010 outlined an intervention programme with four pillars: 1) rapid identification and response to disease outbreaks, 2) risk-based vaccination, 3) enhanced management, and 4) control of poultry movements and development of disease-free compartments [17] . Surveillance activities for HPAI in Vietnam foresaw clinical case reporting, surveys on markets and slaughterhouses to improve knowledge of virus circulation, and mapping of temporal and spatial distributions of wild birds [17] . Further, surveillance was conducted to assess vaccination protection and to investigate the cause and implement corrective measures if the results were not satisfactory [16] . It was also used to demonstrate whether viruses were still circulating and to assess their antigenic makeup and their distribution. Based on new information that is continuously becoming available, Vietnamese animal health authorities have been modifying the intervention programme to increase its effectiveness. C. Transition Vietnam may cease vaccination once the risk of infection has significantly decreased, if surveillance and disease reporting systems manage to detect and investigate all cases of suspected HPAI, and if production and marketing methods that are risk factors for virus transmission have been changed [16] .

For example, the RTA barracks were very well ventilated with wide open windows in the sleeping quarters. Also, other activities such as classroom training and eating occurred in the open air or under a roof only. It is possible that these factors could have potentially dampened intense internal transmission. Other simple interventions could also potentially be considered to mitigate transmission such as arranging sleeping cots foot to foot instead of head to head or organizing training activities and sleeping arrangements into discrete clusters.

Most children can immunologically contain or eradicate the organism without pathology developing. However, in a minority, the organism overcomes the immunological constraints, proliferates and causes TB disease. Each year a million children develop TB disease, with a quarter dying. While it is known that young children and those with immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of progression from TB infection to TB disease, our understanding of risk factors for this transition is limited. The most immunologically disruptive process that can happen during childhood is infection with another pathogen and yet the impact of co-infections on TB risk is poorly investigated. Many diseases have overlapping geographical distributions to TB and affect similar patient populations. It is therefore likely that infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa may impact on the risk of developing TB disease following exposure and infection, although disentangling correlation and causation is challenging. As vaccinations also disrupt immunological pathways, these may also impact on TB risk. In this article we describe the pediatric immune response to M. tuberculosis and then review the existing evidence of the impact of co-infection with other pathogens, as well as vaccination, on the host response to M. tuberculosis.

Most children can immunologically contain or eradicate the organism without pathology developing. However, in a minority, the organism overcomes the immunological constraints, proliferates and causes TB disease. Each year a million children develop TB disease, with a quarter dying. While it is known that young children and those with immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of progression from TB infection to TB disease, our understanding of risk factors for this transition is limited. The most immunologically disruptive process that can happen during childhood is infection with another pathogen and yet the impact of co-infections on TB risk is poorly investigated. Many diseases have overlapping geographical distributions to TB and affect similar patient populations. It is therefore likely that infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa may impact on the risk of developing TB disease following exposure and infection, although disentangling correlation and causation is challenging. As vaccinations also disrupt immunological pathways, these may also impact on TB risk. In this article we describe the pediatric immune response to M. tuberculosis and then review the existing evidence of the impact of co-infection with other pathogens, as well as vaccination, on the host response to M. tuberculosis. We focus on the impact of other organisms on the risk of TB disease in children, in particularly evaluating if co-infections drive host immune responses in an age-dependent way.

The factors that affect the effectiveness and safety of JEV vaccines are the virus strain, method for viral cultivation, vaccine purity and vaccine formulation [68] ; however, the effect of formalin inactivation on the quality of vaccine has never been studied. This is important because formalin-induced hypersensitivity has been found associated with risk of enhanced disease during subsequent infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and formalin inactivation altered the antigenicity of poliovirus [38, 41, 69] . Antigenic characterization of formalin-inactivated poliovirus vaccine by using a panel of MAbs revealed that modification of antigenicity is time-dependent [38] . Using a previously collected panel of anti-flavivirus MAbs and the established Ag-ELISA [49, 53] , we found that only the T16 MAb binding domain was time-and temperature-dependently altered by formalin inactivation. This observation suggested it might be valuable to evaluate the effect of residual formalin in formulated bulk on vaccine shelf life in the future. Importantly, regardless of the JEV strain used, formalin treatment altered the T16 epitope of all tested JE viruses. In contrast, epitopes recognized by 2B5B-3 and 2F2 MAbs on FIV-Nakayama were temporarily modified for specimen collected at early time point. Modification of these two epitopes was Nakayama strain-specific and was reversible since this phenomenon was only observed in the early time point specimen of formalin-treated Nakayama alone.",14.732403909079807,9.851398176172776

The fraction of class I individuals in the population is about 3.12 per 100000. In epidemiology, the basic reproductive number, R 0 is defined as the number of cases one case generates on average over the course of its infectious period in an otherwise totally susceptible population [25] . R 0 is one of the most important contributions of mathematics to epidemiology and it has provided a metric to evaluate the risk of the outbreaks of the epidemics in the population. Only infectious diseases with R 0 w1could possibly lead to a potential outbreak. The infectivity levels of infectious diseases may differ considerably. For example, for the pandemic influenza in 1918, R 0 is between 2 and 3 [26] ; for SARS in 2003, R 0 is between 1.8 and 4.2 [27] ; for H1N1 in 2009, R 0 is between 1.8 and 3.2 [28] ; for smallpox, R 0 could reach 6.0 [29] . Based on the analysis on the pandemic data from the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, R 0~3 :0, v~0:2 were chosen to parameterize our model for the baseline scenario in this research.

Very recently, a collection of experimental ZIKV vaccines have been shown to lower viral load post challenge in nonpathogenic animal infection models. 21, 22 These data are encouraging. In this regard, it is important to examine additional novel vaccine approaches targeting ZIKA in additional models that similar to susceptible humans, might show disease. Here we evaluated a synthetic DNA vaccine, designed to express a novel consensus ZIKV-prM and E antigen, for immunogenicity following electroporation-enhanced immunisation in mice and non-human primates. We observed that ZIKV-prME DNA vaccination was immunogenic and generated antigen-specific T cells and binding and neutralising antibodies in both mice and NHPs. Uniquely, the NHPs were immunised with ZIKV-prME through electroporation by the intradermal route, which uses lower voltage and a smaller transfection area than i.m. electroporation, as we have recently described. 23 Further study of such approaches may provide advantages in clinical settings.",13.933431377270995,6.990366294573458

Second, the reproduction number can be evaluated multiple times, e.g., before (and after) an infection control measure intervention. To this end, it is needed to distinguish the reproduction number after control intervention from the basic reproductive number R 0 , which is estimated before the intervention. Now we refer to the reproduction number after control intervention as the effective reproduction number, denoted by R eff . Then we can compare R eff with R 0 , and we can evaluate the efficacy of a control measure quantitatively based on R eff . By doing so, eventually we can determine how to apply control intervention to reduce R eff to less than one.

Surprisingly, neither RU486 nor DEX improved the health status of virus-infected piglets, but instead, enhanced the disease. After evaluating the proinflammatory cytokine levels in infected piglets, we found that RU486 exerted a negative effect on the host antiinflammatory response during HP-PRRSV infection by suppressing the physiological concentrations of GCs, which play a vital role in the anti-viral process. In contrast, DEX inhibited the inflammation induced by HP-PRRSV, although the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood were significantly decreased and long-lasting high fever and lung lesions were also observed in these HuN4-infected piglets. Despite the solvent of RU486 contained 50% ethanol (30 mg/ml), the dose used for each piglet was no more than 0.1 g/kg b.w., which has been demonstrated to have neither significant effect on the plasma cortisol levels nor anti-viral cell-mediate immune response, as well as no perceptible depression of the central nervous system [22, 25] . Thus, we believe that DEX induces immunosuppression during HP-PRRSV infection, allowing enhanced viral replication and leading to high mortality.

For this purpose we used two-layer network where in one layer we use the SIR-model with vaccination for the propagation of a disease, and in the other layer we used the M-model (with M = 2), for the opinion formation process, where compromise and persuasion are the two processes involved and are controlled by the parameter r. We found that, in all the cases, the number of recovered agents decreases as ω increases, and this is due to the fact that as the vaccine becomes more effective, more people remain vaccinated and the propagation of the disease slows down. We found an epidemic threshold ω Ã above which we ensure that an epidemic will not develop. Furthermore, we found that above a certain value of β Ã the propagation of the disease is enhanced and it is impossible to prevent it from becoming an epidemic. Even for ω = 1 there will be a final macroscopic number of recovery individuals in the steady state. We computed this threshold as a function of r, and we found that a neutral society is the best scenario to prevent an epidemic (r % 1). When compromise dominates the process of opinion formation (r << 1), the agents tend to have a moderate opinion, making difficult that they become extremist in favor of vaccination. The disease spreads through the non vaccinated agents very easily, even when the virulence is small. On the other hand, when persuasion dominates the process of opinion formation (r >> 1) the agents tend to have an extremist opinion. All the extremist agents in favor of the vaccine will be vaccinated, but those agents with a negative opinion, which are an important fraction of the population, will be easily infected. In a neutral society it is more likely to convince those agents with a negative opinion in favor on vaccination, to become extremist in favor. With compromise and persuasion in the same proportion it is easier to convince people to get vaccinated, blocking the propagation of the disease and preventing it to expand all over the population.

However, the residual risk of kidney complications remains substantial even with current standard of care, including tight glycemic control, and people with diabetes are three times more likely to die from kidney disease than those without diabetes [11] . No new treatments for diabetic nephropathy have emerged since the angiotensin-receptor blockers irbesartan and losartan demonstrated efficacy in this indication in 2001 [12, 13] . Since then, several novel pharmacotherapeutic approaches for diabetic kidney disease have failed to exhibit beneficial effects in carefully controlled clinical trials [14] . As a consequence, there is a greater interest in potential renoprotective effects of type 2 diabetes drugs that are independent of their glucose-lowering properties -so-called pleiotropic effects.

Furthermore, several important bovine health-related QTL have also been localized to genomic regions either proximal to or directly overlapping one or more TLR loci (for review see [8, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] ). Therefore, we utilized massively parallel pyrosequencing of a pooled TLR amplicon library (TLRs 1-10) to comprehensively evaluate nucleotide variation and haplotype structure for 31 cattle breeds representing Bos taurus taurus, Bos taurus indicus, and their subspecific hybrids (composites). Overall, 276 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4 insertion-deletion (indel) mutations were detected and validated. Bovine TLR SNPs and indels leveraged from the pyrosequencing study were used in a casecontrol analysis to identify risk factors underlying differential susceptibility to MAP in U.S. dairy cattle. In addition, we also comprehensively report on bovine TLR haplotype structure, the extent of haplotype sharing among specialized breeds and subspecific lineages, and provide median joining networks as putative representations of bovine TLR haplotype evolution [28] . Finally, we provide computational evidence for several bovine TLR genes evolving under disparate modes of non-neutral evolution, thereby underscoring their potential importance to bovine innate immunity and health-related traits.

General George Washington knew that the troops were vulnerable to smallpox and made the strategic decision to have soldiers variolated. This decision may have contributed to the defeat of the British in the Revolutionary War (1776-1783). The Army continued to vaccinate its recruits against smallpox until the early 1990s, 20 years after vaccination stopped in the civilian population and smallpox was considered eradicated (7) . After the 2001 terrorist attack on the United States and the use of anthrax spores in a bioterrorism attack, smallpox once again was viewed as a potential threat to US military readiness (11) . Smallpox is caused by an orthomyxovirus and poses a high epidemic risk (12, 13) . Using smallpox as a biological weapon was unfortunately not new to warfare; sundries, blankets, and handkerchiefs were distributed to Native Americans in 1763 around Fort Pitt, Pennsylvania to decimate the local, native population (3). Restarting smallpox vaccination in a posteradication world with a live vaccine was not without risk and serious adverse events (AEs) were reported (14, 15) . After 2003, the military decided to vaccinate only individuals who were due to be deployed in ""high risk"" areas. New smallpox vaccine formulations associated with fewer AEs have been developed. Currently, the Strategic National Stockpile has three smallpox vaccines: ACAM2000 ® , the only licensed smallpox vaccine in the US; Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV); and Imvamune (Bavarian Nordic); the Center for Disease Control recommends routine vaccination only for specific populations at high risk of occupational exposure (16) .",13.279945296289887,7.111855086470473

Nevertheless, the analysis of the T cell responses showed only a modest difference between the two protocols, at least in terms of frequency of T CD4 + and T CD8 + cells producing IFN-c or TNF-a. This indicates that other important aspects of the T cell function that were not evaluated here may be differentially activated by the vaccination protocols and may account for the differences in the protection against cysts. One such aspect is the polyfunctionality of the T cells, or the capacity of producing multiple cytokines at the same time. Several vaccination studies have correlated polyfunctionality with the improvement of the protection against infectious challenge [82] [83] [84] . Reyes-Sandoval and co-workers, for example, demonstrated in a mice model of P. berghei that adenovirus-MVA heterologous vaccination protocols resulted in activation of polyfunctional T cells that produced IFN-c, TNF-a and IL-2, which was not observed in the homologous vaccination [85] . These reports suggest that a thorough evaluation of the efficacy of a vaccination protocol should involve not only the measurement of the potency of the response, but also of its quality.

Therefore, their impact on the immune responses induced after IAV vaccination are being analyzed [153] [154] [155] [156] . The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is localized in chromosome 6 of the human genome, it includes multiple genes and exhibits considerable diversity between populations. Moreover, in this genomic region, there is a higher presence of SNPs than in other sections of the genome. MHC class I and class II molecules have an essential role in the adaptive immune system in response to infections. Both classes of proteins bind peptide fragments derived from pathogens to be presented on the cell surface for recognition by appropriate T cells [97, 161, 162] . In those genes, the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I and II are important because of their role in the immune system. Gelder et al. studied whether HLA class II polymorphisms modulate anti-IAV antibody responses to vaccination in a United Kingdom population [154] . For that, a cohort of HLA-typed donors at risk was investigated, and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) titers were evaluated before and 28 days after the administration of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. A correlation between HLA class II alleles and IAV HAI titers in the influenza risk group was found. Moreover, a positive association between non-responsiveness to influenza vaccine and HLA-DRB1*07 and a negative association with HLA-DRB1*13 and HLA-DQB1*0603-9/14 [154] was reported, suggesting that polymorphisms in HLA class II molecules affect antibody responses to IAV vaccination.

There are a number of vaccine-related issues that must be addressed before population-based influenza vaccination strategies are optimized. The concept of a -one size fits all‖ vaccine needs to be updated, given the recent ability to probe the virus-host interface through RNA interference approaches that facilitate the identification of host genes affecting virus replication, immunity, and disease. There is also a need for revision of the current influenza virus vaccine strategies for at-risk populations, particularly those at either end of the age spectrum. An example of an improved vaccine regime might include the use of a vectored influenza virus vaccine that expresses the HA, NA and M and/or NP proteins for the two currently circulating influenza A subtypes and both influenza B strains so that vaccine take and vaccine antigen levels are not an issue in inducing protective immunity.

All of these viruses are also transmitted in an urban cycle comprising humans and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. 1, 5, 8 Urban epidemics of yellow fever were effectively controlled in the 1950s and 1960s by mosquito control and human vaccination programmes combined with strict enforcement of the International Health Regulations (IHR) requirement that travellers to and from endemic areas show evidence of yellow fever vaccination. 8 The success of these programmes led to complacency and redirection of resources, which resulted in decreased compliance with vaccination requirements in endemic countries. This situation, combined with less strict enforcement of IHR for travellers, contributed to increasing epidemic transmission in some African and American countries.",13.32668605517015,6.386090116448528

A number of epidemiological analyses have been performed; many have failed to account for either confounding by other seasonal factors, or ''ecological fallacy'' resulting from the use of aggregated exposure and outcome data [3] [4] [5] 28] . More methodologically sophisticated studies have yielded conflicting results on the link between influenza and IPD [29] [30] [31] . The major clinical implications of our study are 2-fold: first, that dramatic increases in influenza incidence, as might be seen during a pandemic year, would not in and of themselves imply a marked surge in risk of IPD, but rather would do so only if there were overlap between flu and pneumococcal waves. This observation may help explain the absence of a marked increase in IPD risk in our jurisdiction during the (atypical) spring wave of the 2009 influenza A-H1N1 pandemic. Although public health agencies issued calls for stepped-up pneumococcal vaccination because of the pandemic [32] , the fact that the pandemic and pneumococcal season were out of phase may have made this unnecessary. Second, the short-term surge in IPD risk accompanying lagged increases in influenza, if causal, implies that some fraction of IPD is ''influenza-attributable.'' As such there may be important unrecognized population health benefits associated with influenza vaccination programs that include younger individuals. Traditionally, influenza immunization programs have focused on older individuals and sometimes the very young, as the risk of adverse outcomes of flu appear greatest in these age groups. Some modelers have recommended younger individuals be targeted with influenza vaccination in order to protect older individuals from influenza via herd effects, and these projections appear to have been borne out in at least one recent randomized trial [33, 34] . However, IPD causes important morbidity in those in age groups not included in traditional influenza immunization programs, and our analysis suggests that prevention of influenza-attributable pneumococcal disease could also be considered as a benefit of influenza vaccination targeting older children and younger adults.",12.45714486874623,5.212105869147867

Genetic heterogeneity between populations occurs when sick animals display the same clinical signs, but these signs are caused by infections involving different pathogens that elicit potentially different immune responses. When this occurs, mutations in different genes and regulatory elements may lead to susceptibility to different pathogens which also differ in their prevalence across environments, leading to an apparent genotype-by-environment interaction for risk of BRD. When this is the case, the genetic correlation between risk of BRD in the different environments will be substantially less than one and integrating data for animals from different environments will result in the identification of QTL or production of GP that have a reduced pathogen specificity. This approach will therefore tend to reduce the ability to identify variants with pathogen-specific effects on risk of BRD. Considering the cost and difficulty of creating GP training populations representing the range of U.S. cattle production environments, it is imperative that we fully leverage existing disease status data.

A three part review series has been developed focusing on calf health from birth to weaning. In this paper, the last of the three part series, we review disease prevention and management with particular reference to pneumonia, focusing primarily on the pre-weaned calf. Pneumonia in recently weaned suckler calves is also considered, where the key risk factors are related to the time of weaning. Weaning of the suckler calf is often combined with additional stressors including a change in nutrition, environmental change, transport and painful husbandry procedures (castration, dehorning). The reduction of the cumulative effects of these multiple stressors around the time of weaning together with vaccination programmes (preconditioning) can reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality in the feedlot. In most studies, calves housed individually and calves housed outdoors with shelter, are associated with decreased risk of disease. Even though it poses greater management challenges, successful group housing of calves is possible. Special emphasis should be given to equal age groups and to keeping groups stable once they are formed. The management of pneumonia in calves is reliant on a sound understanding of aetiology, relevant risk factors, and of effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Early signs of pneumonia include increased respiratory rate and fever, followed by depression. The single most important factor determining the success of therapy in calves with pneumonia is early onset of treatment, and subsequent adequate duration of treatment.

Adoptive transfer of activated effector RSV-specific CD8 T cells, in vitro stimulated T cell lines, or in vitro propagated T cell clones leads to enhanced RSV clearance from the lung following RSV challenge. These effector CD8 T cell transfers were also associated with increased weight loss, indicating that infusion of effector CD8 T cells can induce increased systemic disease [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, the role of memory CD8 T cells in providing protection against RSV infection remains unclear.

Furthermore, this is the first study to report quantitative data for ILI burden by complication status (with complications recorded or without complications recorded), age, risk and vaccination status. Influenza vaccination uptake increased over the study period, but vaccination still failed to reach 20-25% of people aged 65 years and older. In England, the target rate for influenza vaccination in 2011-2012 was 75% in people aged 65+ years and 60% in other at-risk groups, increasing to 75% in 2013/2014 [20] . Our study indicates that the vaccination uptake rates achieved in the elderly population were close to the target range. However, vaccination uptake rates in other at-risk groups were generally exceedingly low compared with the 2013/2014 target of 75%, except in a few conditions such as diabetes and renal disease. Improving vaccination uptake rates in younger age groups with risk conditions, and further improving vaccination uptake in the elderly, may have the potential to reduce the considerable burden of ILI in the UK.

Clearly, the transmission characteristics (e.g. air and saliva borne versus STIs), the potential prevention measures (e.g. social distancing versus condom use) and the epidemic stage (e.g. emergence versus endemic equilibrium versus elimination) are interdependent, and determine both the utility and specification of a BCM. For instance, many influenza models use vaccination as a prevention measure with individuals evaluating their previous influenza vaccination decisions to determine the current season's strategy. It would seem unrealistic to require more data to parameterize both behavioural change and disease transmission models with the aim to develop more general models that suit any infectious disease, albeit that behavioural change in response to one disease's risk perceptions could change the risk perceptions of another. At the current stage of BCM development and parametrization, generalized BCMs accommodating multiple pathogens and different transmission routes seem unrealistic. However, it would be easier to combine multiple diseases with the same transmission and prevention properties.

Although live attenuated IB vaccines remarkably induce potent immune response, the potential risk of reversion to virulence, neutralization by the maternal antibodies, and recombination and mutation events are important concern on their usage. On the other hand, inactivated vaccines induce a weaker immune response and may require multiple dosing and/or the use of adjuvants that probably have potential safety risks and increased economic burdens. Consequently, alternative IB vaccines are widely sought. Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology have resulted in experimental IB vaccines that show promise in antibody and T-cells responses, comparable to live attenuated vaccines. Recombinant DNA vaccines have also been enhanced to target multiple serotypes and their efficacy has been improved using delivery vectors, nanoadjuvants, and in ovo vaccination approaches.

Prior to this study, no information was available concerning the incidence and prevalence of these viruses in Cape Verde archipelago. Results: To provide information regarding the health status of the canine population in Vila do Maio, Maio Island, Cape Verde, 53 rectal swabs were collected from 53 stray dogs during 2010 and 93 rectal swabs and 88 blood samples were collected from 125 stray dogs in 2011. All rectal swabs (2010 n = 53; 2011 n = 93) were analysed for the presence of canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus and canine coronavirus nucleic acids by quantitative PCR methods. Specific antibodies against canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus were also assessed (2011 n = 88). From the 2010 sampling, 43.3% (23/53) were positive for canine parvovirus DNA, 11.3% (6/53) for canine distemper virus RNA and 1.9% (1/53) for canine coronavirus RNA. In 2011, the prevalence values for canine parvovirus and canine coronavirus were quite similar to those from the previous year, respectively 44.1% (41/93), and 1.1% (1/93), but canine distemper virus was not detected in any of the samples analysed (0%, 0/93).

Training programs in infectious disease typically focus on a single or narrow range of biological scales, but more crosscutting approaches are needed. Training grants focused on multiscale literacy in infectious disease research should be a priority for funding agencies, for example. Professional societies could also lead the way by sponsoring workshops, symposia, and other events on integration across disciplines. The involvement of professional societies has the added benefit of allowing infectious disease researchers to expand their perspectives beyond their years of formal training.

Great strides have recently been realized in both the treatment and understanding the mechanisms leading to sequelae later in life in this susceptible population. Our hope is that this review has left the reader with an appreciation for previous work as well as highlighting future areas of research that are warranted. These include but are not limited to gaining a more complete understanding of the molecular programing that drives development and regeneration of the respiratory epithelium that will allow for a better appreciation of the affects an immature lung experiences due to premature birth into an oxygen rich environment. Infants born prematurely, and likely provided oxygen, experience enhanced disease due to respiratory infections later in life. Understanding what pulmonary cell types are principally infected by various respiratory pathogens, like IAV, in healthy subjects precludes our understanding of the cell-specific alterations occurring in preterm infants later in life. Although cell-specific pulmonary tropism of IAV is unlikely to drastically change in this population, it may prove that a cell-specific imbalance in these aberrant lungs drives enhanced disease. It is also clear that genes involved in directing lung development overlap with those of the pulmonary innate immune system (97) . It is therefore likely that overall respiratory health is accomplished by an interaction with oxygen at birth that influences the developmental trajectory of the lung and pulmonary innate immune system. A better understanding of how the oxygen environment at birth influences gene-innate immune interactions could help identify children at risk for disease and ideally treatments that improve their health.",17.893706007327445,7.968839594954285

No signs of enhanced respiratory disease symptoms in the form of alveolitis or interstitial pneumonia were observed in the lungs of BLP-F vaccinated animals that were subsequently challenged with RSV. In contrast, vaccination with FI-RSV followed by RSV challenge induced severe enhanced disease symptoms as expected and observed before [51] . The exact mechanism(s) by which vaccination with FI-RSV induces enhanced respiratory disease in naïve infants after infection is still not clear. Recent work in mice implicated the failure of FI-RSV in inducing virus neutralizing antibodies to poor affinity maturation, likely caused by the lack of sufficient TLR stimulation [58] , as well as to an excessively Th2-skewed immune response [49, 59] . The absence of enhanced disease symptoms after vaccination with BLP-F may therefore be explained by the BLP-F driven induction of robust serum levels of virus neutralizing antibodies accompanied by a relatively high IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, which is typical for a better balanced Th1/Th2 type immune response, compared to animals that received FI-RSV. Although the phenotype of the immune response induced by nasal administration of BLP-F needs further exploration, the type of followed by a challenge with RSV/A/long (10 6 pfu) at 14 days after the last vaccination.

For example, intranasal immunization with BLPs mixed with influenza subunit vaccine elicited Th1 skewed immune responses compared to those induced by intramuscular and intranasal administered influenza subunit vaccine alone [23] . With respect to the TLR stimulation mediated affinity-maturation it is noteworthy that BLPs act as a TLR-2 agonist driving the maturation of human dendritic cells and macrophages in vitro [22] , while the role of TLR-2 in BLP dependent immune stimulation was recently confirmed by in vivo experiments using TLR2 2/2 mice (unpublished data).",18.25581636099824,7.5873282713103585

To this end we expressed recombinant soluble variants of the F protein fused to a peptidoglycan binding moiety, which were subsequently loaded onto the BLPs (BLP-F). Different variants of F were analyzed with respect to their conformation and reactivity with neutralizing antibodies, assuming that F protein mimicking the metastable prefusion form of RSV F exposes a more extensive and relevant epitope repertoire than F proteins corresponding to the stable inactive postfusion structure. In agreement with this assumption, Magro and coworkers recently showed that antibodies specific for the prefusion form of F account for most of the neutralizing activity found in human sera [29] . Our results indicate that intranasal vaccination of mice or cotton rats with BLPs displaying F proteins that expose prefusion-specific epitopes induces strong F-specific IgG responses in sera that have potent RSV neutralizing capacity. Furthermore, such a vaccine resulted in substantial secretory IgA (SIgA) levels in the nose, while virus titers in the lungs were significantly decreased after challenge compared to mock-vaccinated animals. In contrast to animals that received FI-RSV, no signs of vaccination-induced enhanced disease symptoms could be observed upon RSV challenge after intranasal vaccination with BLP-F preparations.",15.171116437259165,6.7359211161831976

The success of applying real CPI networks in epidemic simulations allowed for an evaluation of various strategies for disease control. The class cancellation strategy, as well as a total of five network-based strategies (degree, strength, betweenness, CC, and the primary eigenvector), were evaluated, and the evaluation results are described as below. As shown in Fig. 7 , most network-based strategies exhibit nearly identical power in mitigating disease spread. Specifically, as quarantine/ vaccination coverage increases, the total number of individuals infected generally decreases in a linear pattern. ). In SCAU, the influenza epidemic occurred in two waves: the first wave (green) occurred between September 29 and October 9, and the second wave (blue) occurred between October 9 and October 21, 2011. The two waves were aligned to put the disease onset date at the point of origin. In USHS, the influenza records were derived from absentee data 4 . As shown in panels A and B, the simulation results are in good accordance with the real influenza records in both SCAU and USHS. In panel B, the incomplete blue line corresponds to a gap in the original absentee data 4 . was also evaluated, with similar observations obtained ( Supplementary Fig. S10 ). Here, the x-axis denotes vaccination coverage, and the y-axis denotes the total population infected. As quarantine/vaccination coverage increases, the total number of individuals infected drops in a linear pattern (the slopes are − 1.0, − 1.3, − 0.9, and − 1.2 for uniformly random, scale-free, small-world, and SCAU CPI networks, respectively). In addition, the targeted vaccination strategies were found to be extremely effective in SCAU and FRPS than in the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, is ranked as the most effective strategy for disease control as it shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students. Here the SEIR parameters β 0 = 2.5 × 10 −4 sec −1 , δ = Figure 7D -G suggest that the effectiveness of targeted quarantine/vaccination strategies is CPI-dependent. Specifically, the targeted quarantine/vaccination strategies are extremely effective in SCAU and FRPS relative to that in the US schools. For example, by applying the betweenness centrality selection strategy on the SCAU CPI networks, the ratio of population infected drops from 0.52 to 0.39 under the quarantine/vaccination coverage of 10%, and further drops to 0.27 under the quarantine/vaccination coverage of 20%. On FRPS networks, the ratio of population infected is observed to be as small as 0.05 under a quarantine/vaccination coverage of 20%. In contrast, the ratio of population infected remains higher than 0.50, even at a quarantine/vaccination coverage as high as 30% in both USD and USHS.",11.934584137530384,9.166075097378036

It is a common cause of necrotising upper respiratory tract infections (URI) in cats housed in shelters, with more than 50 % of cats shedding virus only one week after admission [1] . The virus typically replicates in epithelial cells of the conjunctiva and the upper respiratory tract and infects local neurons, establishing latency in the trigeminal, pterygopalatine and cranial cervical ganglia [2] . Although virus replication is generally limited to the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva, viraemia has been detected during the acute phase of infection [3, 4] and a recent report has described a case of non-suppurative meningoencephalitis in cats, suggesting that FHV-1 has potential to cause more invasive disease [5] . Vaccination has been used to help control disease caused by FHV-1 since the mid-1970s.

This is critically important within the CNS which has limited regenerative capacity. In summary, our data identify astrocytes as prominent targets underlying IFN-c mediated suppression of chronic CNS inflammation [19] . The data further provide a link between sustained inflammatory responses, enhanced demyelination and axonal degeneration associated with loss of neurological function during EAE and chronic progressive MS. Although the inability of astrocytes to respond to IFN-c did not alter disease in the brain, engagement of the IFN-c receptor on astrocytes in spinal cord limits demyelination and functions in a neuroprotective capacity. Current therapies for MS are primarily focused on antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory approaches and have been partially successful in treating acute episodes. The identification of astrocytes as critical responders and mediators of IFN-c signaling in limiting CNS autoimmune disease may provide insights into new approaches to limit long term progression to disability.

In particular, on the communication layer, the outbreak of the information about the disease can be triggered not only by its own spreading dynamics but also by the the epidemic outbreak on the counter-layer. In addition, high disease and information-transmission rates can enhance markedly the final density of the informed or refractory population. On the layer of physical contact, the epidemic threshold can be increased but only if information itself spreads through the communication layer at a high rate. The information spreading can greatly reduce the final refractory density for the disease through vaccination.

Implementation of evidencebased approaches that are effective at both prevention and early intervention for diabetes are needed. Such approaches require behavioural changes in diet and physical inactivity, raising public awareness of diabetes, and convincing policy-makers and the public alike of the benefits of early diagnosis for disease reversal and management. One of the targets for the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) is to reduce by one-third premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment by 2030, with action on diabetes essential. Actions include implementation of National Diabetes programmes and extension of health promotion activities. 1 Tackling the interaction between diabetes and infection requires a greater understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying the altered susceptibility to infection seen in diabetes, and knowledge of how therapeutic management of diabetes impacts on risk of infection. It is likely that tight control of hyperglycaemia lowers the risk of infection, although this has yet to be comprehensively demonstrated in prospective studies. Current international treatment guidelines for T2DM are based on research conducted in high-income countries focussed on preventing adverse cardiovascular outcomes and early death. There is a lack of evidence on which to base guidelines for people living in LMIC, and choice of glucose-lowering therapy may impact on infection risk and outcomes. For example, there is emerging evidence for beneficial infection outcomes in people with diabetes taking metformin compared with other therapies, [102] [103] [104] and glyburide/glibenclamide has been associated with anti-inflammatory properties and lower mortality in melioidosis. 105 Vaccination remains the cornerstone in controlling infectious diseases, and people with diabetes are prioritised as a high-risk group for vaccination against a range of pathogens including pneumococcus, influenza and VZV. Development of highly efficacious vaccines against intracellular infections such as TB, melioidosis and leishmaniasis, to which people with diabetes are at greater risk, is an important priority, and progress requires consideration of how to overcome the specific immune impairments seen in diabetes. Characterising the impact of diabetes on protective immunity is particularly important for melioidosis, where more than half of all cases occur in people with diabetes, and cost-effective implementation of a successful vaccine is likely to involve targeting this group. 106 B. pseudomallei therefore represents an exemplar pathogen for defining the immune deficits in diabetes, and how to overcome them.",12.577597839975917,6.288967403938966

Recent research has also focused on the use of radio frequency identification devices [56] [57] as well as video analysis technology [58] to capture social mixing and contact patterns at mass gatherings. These contact data can be used to simulate or model the transmission of various infectious disease pathogens including pandemic influenza.

Therefore, we explored the immunogenic and protective potential of VSV replicon particles as a vectored vaccine approach against PRRSV. Such VRP were successfully used before as efficacious experimental vaccines against SARS, IAV and BTV [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . In the present study, VSV replicons were engineered to express PRRSV structural proteins, individually or in combination (Table 1) . Emphasis was on GP5, M, GP4 and GP3, since these proteins are important targets for neutralizing and protective antibodies [11, 23, 26, 27] , with the major neutralizing epitopes residing on GP5 [18] . Since several studies have shown that co-expression of PRRSV antigens resulted in better humoral and cellular immune responses than expression of the individual proteins [30, 60] , GP5, M, GP4, GP3 and GP2 proteins were co-expressed to partly mimic the formation of the GP5/M and GP4/3/2 oligomers. Vaccination of pigs with VRP expressing two or five PRRSV envelope proteins in total did not result in any significant reduction of viremia compared with the control group. A tendency for reduced PRRSV-related inflammatory responses was observed only when all five proteins were expressed. Interestingly, vaccination with GP5/M induced fever up to 41.5 °C for 1 day following challenge infection with PRRSV Olot/91 whereas mockvaccinated pigs remained asymptomatic. Fever was less pronounced when all envelope proteins were included in the vaccine. Enhanced disease following vaccination with recombinant GP5 and M was observed previously [42, 61] . This was attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease during natural infection, which is probably mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies [26, 62] . Such antibodies were shown to increase virus infection in porcine alveolar macrophage cultures and in vivo [62] involving different FcγR isoforms [63, 64] .",13.536661798035361,7.9253730783823535

As disease begins to spread, individuals perceive increasing risks and vaccinate according to the decision model, thereby protecting themselves and interrupting potential chains of transmission to others. While all three strategies reduce the total number of infections, the local count strategy affords the greatest and most efficient protection of the three. Under the global prevalence strategy, perceived risk is homogeneous. As cases mount, the vaccination rate rises synchronously throughout the population, arguably resulting in too much too late vaccine coverage. The local strategies avert more infections with fewer vaccinations than the global strategy. As epidemics unfold, risk is both heterogeneous and dynamic, with some portions of the network experiencing greater forces of infection than others. Local decision-making allows earlier detection and response to increasing personal risk, and prevents unnecessary vaccination in lower risk settings, both prior to and following epidemic waves. The local count strategy is more protective than the local prevalence strategy. By tracking the number rather than proportion of infected contacts, individuals more accurately assess the local force of infection. For example, compare a solitary individual with just two social contacts and a gregarious individual with 20. If they both have two infected contacts, then their risk of infection will be similar (assuming that time spent with each contact is sufficient for transmission). Under local count, their perceived risk and consequent vaccination probability will be identical; under local prevalence, the solitary individual will perceive higher risk (i.e., 100% of contacts infected) than the gregarious individual. Under all models, overall vaccine coverage increases as R 0 increases, with the global prevalence achieving near universal coverage by R 0 = 5.",13.823388012695967,6.905690359430542

Recent financial, economic, social, environmental, and health crises have led to the renewed recognition that collaborative approaches between disciplines are urgently needed (5, 6) . The fear of emerging pandemics, as well as climate change, drug resistance, food and water security and safety, has caused a shift from an interdisciplinary approach, whereby experts collaborate across disciplinary boundaries, to a transdisciplinary approach that integrates society and science by including all stakeholders (5, 7, 8) . This transcends traditional boundaries, and integrates knowledge and perspectives from scientific and non-scientific sources (9, 10) . Many communities involved in health issues have proposed transdisciplinary and systemic approaches with different focuses, such as Ecohealth, Global Health, Planetary Health, or Health in scaled Social-Ecological Systems (7, 8) . While there is considerable literature describing what integrated approaches to health could be, there are no recognized guidelines-to our knowledge-on how to evaluate to what extent the underlying integration as a principle and approach contributes to constructive management of complex health problems, such as antibiotic resistance or outbreaks of highly infectious diseases, e.g., highly pathogenic avian influenza, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus disease. OH emphasizes the commonalities of human, animal, plant, and environmental health. In this perspective, it can be regarded as an ""umbrella"" term that captures integrative approaches to health across these highly interlinked components (4, 11) . Due to the existing, historically contingent, organization of societies and disciplines, and the sectoral allocation of resources, developing integrated approaches is difficult, and benefits can be delayed. There is thus a need to provide evidence on the added value of OH to governments, researchers, funding bodies, and stakeholders (5, 12) and to explore how to evaluate integrated approaches to health.

Differently, other authors consider pharyngitis, even streptococcal one, a benign, self-limiting disease. Consequently they wouldn't routinely perform microbiological tests and, pointing to a judicious use of antibiotics, they would reserve antimicrobial treatment to well-selected cases.

For many viruses, however, the immune response extends beyond that necessary for viral clearance and creates disease symptoms. For example, infection with certain influenza virus (IAV) strains results in lung recruitment of high numbers of neutrophils (and other leukocytes) leading to a fast-progressing viral pneumonia and extensive lung damage [1, 2] .

Virus-specific CD4 + T cells substantially contribute to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced bronchiolitis in children [4] .

Because the vaccine is a live virus, it is transmissible among birds. Thus, vaccination strategies have the potential to impact the evolutionary genetics of wild type strains of aPMV-1 including those that cause ND. In this report, we provided evidence that viruses isolated from wild and domestic birds have recombined with vaccine strains, because vaccinated birds are protected from disease but not infection with other strains of aPMV-1. Despite the use of vaccines since the 1950s, the population size of the strain from which the most widely used vaccine was derived has steadily increased. In contrast, other contemporary genotypes, which emerged in the 1960s, experienced a decline in population size in 1998, which may reflect a change in poultry farming practices or disease. Vaccination imposed a unique selection profile on the genotypes derived from the vaccine-related strains when compared with nonvaccine-related strains. Although modified live viruses are important for controlling Newcastle Disease, the potential of vaccination strategies to change viral diversity and population dynamics should be considered. and is not present in our sequences.

For other interventions-such as biosecurity measures against FMD, or the use of face masks against influenza-their use is not reliably reported nor their efficacy known. Another difficulty is knowing the way in which control measures are applied in practice. For example, the pre-emptive culling during the UK 2001 FMD epidemic was found retrospectively to have been significantly biased towards lower risk farms (mostly smaller sheep farms) rather than higher risk farms (mostly larger farms with cattle).

In order to inform clinical management and optimize treatment regimens for febrile patients, information on common causes and associations of febrile illness, particularly in areas endemic to malaria, is critically required. While previous studies have adopted a syndromic approach to estimate global burden of disease due to diarrhea and pneumonia, such an approach has not been taken to evaluate fever in the absence of other characterizing features (e.g., gastroenteritis, skin or soft tissue infections, etc.) [7] [8] . Pathogen-specific approaches have been utilized to evaluate illness due to certain febrile diseases, predominately malaria, typhoid fever and arboviral infections, such as dengue virus; however, disease burden estimates due to other fever associated organisms, such as Leptospira and Coxiella burnetii, remain in question [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .

Disinhibition is a significant concern for current HIV prevention and control [38] and has the potential to generate the perverse outcome that a successful therapeutic may actually increase HIV incidence [39] . The transmissibility and single-dose administration of TIPs effectively circumvent these problems, unlike current pharmaceutical approaches (i.e. ART) or vaccination. Indeed, the public health benefits of TIPs are uniquely robust to disinhibition, since the intervention spreads more effectively if contact rates increase (Figure 3a ). In contrast, the same degree of disinhibition in the presence of ART or a 30% or 50% protective [17] , both initially deployed to 1% of individuals. TIP intervention is compared to a 30% protective vaccine (light grey), a 50% protective vaccine (dark grey), and ART (black). Vaccine scenarios are based on protection levels reported in a recent clinical trial [34] and UNAIDS target protection goals (50% protection) where each vaccine is assumed to have lifelong efficacy and optimistic levels of coverage (80% and 95% coverage of all risk groups, respectively). The ART scenario is assumed to treat 75% of all infections using a universal test-and-treat approach [27] where ART has 99% efficacy in halting HIV transmission. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002015.g002 vaccine could have the unfortunate effect of increasing HIV/AIDS prevalence and could increase the number of deaths due to AIDS (Figure 3b) , as highlighted by previous analyses [39] .",13.62441956992797,7.65303854344833

African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island's chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. Methods: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar.

Here we ask whether similar phenomena occur in case of antiviral prophylaxis. While vaccination usually provides long-lasting and strong immunity after one or a few vaccination bouts, antiviral prophylactic therapy relies on the continuous administration of drugs. This implies that, in contrast with vaccination, individuals have more opportunities to adjust their actions to the situation in which they face themselves. Further, while the earlier studies focus on the relative perceived risk of infection as compared to vaccination, we consider infections and antiviral drugs that induce a real, albeit possibly small, risk of death. Throughout, our aim is to decipher how the optimal antiviral prophylactic control strategy is moulded by the transmissibility of the pathogen, by the risk associated with antiviral prophylaxis, and by the efficacy of antiviral drugs in reducing susceptibility, infectiousness, and mortality.",13.17176110075598,6.349016251011091

Immunity can be acquired through infection at a young age (natural immunity) or vaccination (artificial immunity). Natural immunity is currently difficult to acquire in Korea and the recent implementation of mandatory infant vaccination under the NIP leaves the challenge of increasing immunity in adults [24] . However, it is practically difficult to administer the hepatitis A vaccine to all individuals. Therefore, all three policies should be deployed to prevent hepatitis A outbreaks. Which policy will be conducted as a priority will depend on the circumstances in each country. Immunization policies, in particular, depend on the hepatitis A incidence rate in each country. The World Health Organization recommends vaccination of individuals in countries with very low incidence of hepatitis A and rare outbreaks who are at high risk of hepatitis A infection (i.e., those travelling in high-prevalence regions, hemophiliacs, male homosexuals, those with illegal drug abuse, and jobs in contact with primates) [25] . In countries with a high incidence of hepatitis A, large-scale vaccination is not recommended as it will have little effect since many people tend to be infected when they are young and acquire natural immunity. However, large-scale vaccination is a cost-effective measure in countries, such as Korea, with large differences in immunity levels by age and region due to reduction in hepatitis A incidence [25] . The immunity levels are relatively low among Koreans born in the 1970s to 1990s and even lower in urban areas. In addition, the incidence, and complication and mortality rates of hepatitis A increase with age; thus, the hepatitis A fatality rate may increase in future outbreaks. Therefore, a large-scale catch-up vaccination policy is required for adults in their 20s to 40s. The hurdles to the introduction of such a policy, including securing budgets, vaccine supply, and low vaccination rates, can be overcome if with the establishment and implementation of a long-term plan of five years or more. As a short-term measure, organizations such as public health centers should provide adult vaccines at a lower cost than that of private hospitals to provide an alternative for those who are not vaccinated due to cost.",10.333473203682061,6.312496887978021

Of single greatest significance is zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum (L. chagasi) for which the domestic dog is the major reservoir for human infection via sandfly transmission. The disease is endemic in many countries throughout southern Europe, the Americas, northern Africa and Asia and high proportions of dogs in these areas are exposed to and often infected by the pathogen. Recent WHO estimates suggest that worldwide up to 12 million people are infected, with 2 million new cases identified annually and a population of some 350 million people at risk of infection; the risk of infection is significantly enhanced in HIV-infected individuals [12] . Control of leishmaniosis represents one of the greatest challenges for One Health and provides a clear example for the necessity of human and veterinary medicine to work together to develop strategies for management and elimination of this disease. Such measures have already occurred in the endemic focus of disease occurring in Brazil where the Ministry of Health oversees a programme of serologically testing dogs and culling positive animals [13] . Two commercially available vaccines for dogs have become available in Brazil and should form an important part of the control strategy. Data have already been published that show that where vaccination is widely practiced, the prevalence of both canine and human infection decreases due to reduced transmission of the organism [14] .",12.67926145678829,5.221491729519016

Incorporation of selectable marker genes that confer resistance to antibiotics or herbicides may reduce the effect of certain medical or agricultural treatments, which utilize the same compounds. • Inconsistent dosage: An insufficient amount of antigen would not produce the immune response needed to provide protection against disease.

For example, we often expect disease prevalence to vary with age, gender, and workplace of the population under surveillance. Statistical models allow for these influences to adjust the disease risk through space and time. A second impetus for the development of statistical models for disease surveillance is that a large part of epidemiology concerned with estimating relationships between environmental variables and disease risk (i.e., ecological analysis) provided a methodological basis from which to draw. Modelling for space-time disease surveillance is relatively recent, and this is a very active area of statistical surveillance research.

An universal goal is to start appropriate treatment as soon as possible. It is logical that these facts are also valid in patients with invasive fungal infections (IFI). The problem is that IFI are often not easily recognisable and that we can only suspect them in patients at risk. While prospective, randomized studies are lacking, retrospective studies used different criteria of timing, although majority defined time as a period between culture sampling and start of appropriate treatment. Despite this, results uniformly showed that delay is associated with poorer outcome. In patients with candidemia, the importance of timing was assessed analyzing the time period between the time when positive blood cultures were drawn and start of AFT. Delay in treatment ‡12 or ‡24 hours increased hospital mortality 1.5-2.06 fold. Negative impact of delayed diagnosis and consequent AFT was shown in patients with candidemia: a 24-delay in blood culture positivity would almost double the risk of patients' death. Studies in hematological patients with invasive aspergillosis or zygomycosis showed that delay of appropriate antifungal therapy (AFT) for more than 10 or 6 days after the appearance of first symptoms almost doubled the mortality rates. The negative impact of treatment delay on patients' outcome urges physicians to start AFT empirically at high-risk patients with clinically suspected IFI (empirical therapy) or after positive new diagnostic tests associated with imaging findings (pre-emptive therapy, mostly for moulds infections). To avoid overtreatment with new, expensive antifungals, rapid diagnostic tests are necessary. Background: Renal transplant recipients are at increased risk for developing invasive pneumococcal diseases, but may have a poor response to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV). The aim of this study was to compare antibody response of a sequential vaccination schedule of PPV with those of a sequential schedule of 7valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) followed by PPV twelve months later in adult renal transplant recipients. Methods: We conducted a randomized doubleblind controlled study to evaluate the quantitative serological responses to pneumococcal serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F, 1, 5, and 7F. Using isotypespecific ELISA, two-fold antibody response compared to baseline was determined 8 weeks after the first vaccination, before the second vaccination, and 8 weeks after the second vaccination, respectively.

Vaccine effectiveness for PCV13 was based on data for PCV7 in children adjusted for age and risk profile, assuming similar levels of effectiveness against the additional six serotypes. PPSV23 effectiveness was based on an analysis by the Health Protection Agency. The analysis uses a UK NHS payer perspective, therefore only direct costs and outcomes were included. Health outcomes were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Cost and outcomes were discounted at a 3.5% annual rate. Assumptions and parameter uncertainty were tested in sensitivity analyses. Results: It is estimated that adult vaccination with PCV13 instead of PPSV23 is cost-effective at the current NHS list price.

In turn, the ultimate response to a challenge infection may depend on what CNS epitope a priming virus has in common with self. To explore further the idea that different epitopes present at the priming step could determine the outcome after challenge, cDNAs encoding self CNS epitopes were constructed and replaced vaccinia virus vaccination in our prime/challenge model (Theil et al. 2001; Tsunoda et al. 1998 ). In the initial study, cDNAs that encoded the entire PLP protein (PLP all ) and the PLP peptides PLP 139-151 and PLP [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] were constructed. It was found that all three DNA constructs, injected intramuscularly, individually could induce a PLP-specific lymphoproliferative response, which was shown to be CD4 + T cell-mediated, without inducing CNS disease. All three DNA constructs, when injected as the priming step, enhanced the CNS disease (more severe disease and more frequent relapses) that developed subsequent to challenge with PLP 139-151 peptide in CFA, while only priming with PLP all enhanced disease following challenge with PLP 178-191 peptide in CFA. Also, the PLP-specific lymphoproliferative responses present in primed mice prior to challenge increased subsequent to challenge with the PLP peptides (Tsunoda et al. 1998 ). In a subsequent study, a cDNA was constructed that encoded ubiquitin fused to PLP (UPLP), leading to enhanced degradation of PLP through the proteasome pathway and the resulting PLP peptides were presented through the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I pathway (Theil et al. 2001 ). This method mimics infection with an intracellular virus that has molecular mimicry with CNS antigens without causing cytopathic effects in the host. Mice primed with UPLP and then challenged with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in CFA or with PLP 139-151 in CFA developed clinical and pathological signs of CNS disease. Mice primed with UPLP and then challenged with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding b-galactosidase developed pathological signs of CNS disease without any clinical signs of the disease. In contrast, mice primed with PLP all and challenged with PBS in CFA did not develop pathological or clinical signs of the disease, thus indicating that the initial priming event may require efficient MHC class I presentation of the mimicking antigen which occurs with the ubiquitinated construct (Theil et al. 2001 ). An extension of this study more closely examined mice primed with UPLP and then challenged with PLP 139-151 in CFA (Theil et al. 2008) . It was found that these mice experienced a milder relapse phase (1 month post challenge), compared to controls. During the relapse phase, these mice had decreased clinical and pathological signs of disease, decreased in vitro lymphoproliferation to PLP 139-151 , reduced IFN-g production and increased IL-4 production. In addition, CD8 + T cells were found to be activated and expanded in these mice, confirming that degradation through the proteasome pathway and presentation by the MHC class I pathway was occurring, and these CD8 + T cells could contribute to the modulation of the disease observed in these mice (Theil et al. 2008) .",11.768259922387314,8.613751753074665

The strategy also helped overcome one of the greatest obstacles to smallpox eradication: the constant shortage of vaccine supplies. Containment was further facilitated by use of a heat-stable smallpox vaccine and the development of the bifurcated needle that used four times less vaccine than conventional vaccination procedures. The long incubation period of smallpox (12-14 days on average) was yet another advantage, as vaccination within four days of exposure prevented or attenuated disease. 6, 7 The risk-benefit analysis changed in 1980 when smallpox became the first disease in history to be eradicated. In its final report, the Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication weighed the risk of vaccine-associated complications against the risk of smallpox infection and recommended that vaccination be discontinued in every country. 7 Further confidence that smallpox was now a disease of the past was expressed the following year, when the World Health Assembly amended the International Health Regulations to exclude reporting requirements for smallpox. 8 Stocks of variola virus held in laboratories around the world posed the greatest risk that smallpox might return, and this risk was dramatically illustrated by a laboratory accident, resulting in a fatal case of smallpox in the United Kingdom in 1978. That highly-publicized event persuaded national authorities to either destroy virus stocks or transfer them for safe-keeping to designated high-security WHO collaborating centers. The Global Commission cited scientific reasons for preserving virus stocks, and by 1984, all known stocks of variola virus had been consolidated at two centers, in the USA and the former Soviet Union, now the Russian Federation, where they remain today. 9 The Global Commission also recommended that WHO maintain a reserve of smallpox vaccine sufficient to vaccinate 200 million people as prudent preparation for ''unforeseen circumstances''. A committee on orthopoxvirus infections, established following the certification of eradication, was entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing vaccine distribution during an emergency. 7, 10 In 1986, the committee considered that ''unforeseen circumstances'' had become so unlikely that WHO no longer needed to maintain such a large reserve, which was costly to store. 11 As a result, the reserve was reduced to the present stockpile of 2.5 million doses of potent vaccine and a small supply of bifurcated needles. Vaccine in this reserve has not been replaced by second-generation vaccines that have recently been produced.

TCM considers most childhood illnesses to occur at superficial levels, and vaccination actually introduces pathogens, still considered energetically active, into deeper blood levels of the body. In addition, TCM also posits that the body can usually effectively handle only one process at a given time. When two separate processes occur at the same time, the human system could become overwhelmed, especially the tender system of an infant or a young child. Therefore, although multiple vaccines given at the same time are less traumatic for children and save nursing time, they can easily overwhelm an immature immune system and make the child weak and deficient. 352 Although the fear of epidemics motivates the Chinese to vaccinate all their children, TCM practitioners in the West often advise against immunization. 320 There is discrepancy among the homeopaths regarding recommendation of conventional vaccines. A German questionnaire survey reported that homeopathic physicians generally do not refuse vaccinations but show a preference for the DPT vaccines. 239 A British survey conducted between 1987 and 1993 reported that preference for homeopathic remedies for illnesses and religion were the most common reasons parents refused immunization; 21% believed the risk of diseases to be less than the risk of vaccination and would seek homeopathic treatment if any illness developed in their children, and 17% believed that children ""are protected by God and not by vaccines."" 379 A U.S. cross-sectional descriptive survey of 42 homeopathic practitioners and 23 naturopathic practitioners in Massachusetts revealed that the majority of the practitioners did not actively recommend immunizations. 236 Many homeopaths recommend homeopathic vaccines, which are not yet supported by scientific data. 399 A random sample survey by mail of 1% of American chiropractors revealed that one third believe there is no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease, that vaccinations cause more disease than they prevent, and that contracting an infectious disease is safer than immunization. 66 A reported 81% believed that immunization should be voluntary and that spinal adjustment is a viable alternative. A crosssectional, descriptive survey of 90 chiropractics in the Boston metropolitan area reported that only 30% actively recommended childhood immunization. 237 The decision of whether or not to immunize a child is difficult for both parents and practitioners. The advantages of vaccination are difficult to refute, but the temporal relationship between immunization and side effects and the controversies surrounding potential risks are disconcerting. Although data are insufficient on CAM approaches to vaccination today, practitioners should be aware of the slow yet steady trend toward alternatives and should properly address parental concerns and questions regarding immunization. 348 Each practitioner needs to inform parents of the most up-to-date pros and cons of vaccination, be as objective as possible, put aside personal belief systems, and be supportive and understanding of whichever decision the parents make. Parents need to become as informed as possible, consider all the pros and cons, weigh the risks and benefits, and realize that ultimately they must live with the outcome of their decision.",12.551225234707658,6.380740469072424

This research uses a threshold behavioral model (Granovetter & Soong, 1983) to formulate the decision process. Specifically, each individual has two adoption states, and the change of state is calculated based on Equation (4) For a given time step t, individual i will evaluate the proportion of adopters in i's personal network, as the peer pressure of adoption a i (t). Once the peer pressure reaches a threshold T p;i (called the threshold of adoption pressure), an individual will decide to adopt. Meanwhile, individual i also evaluates the proportion of symptomatic individuals in the personal network, as the perceive risks of infection m i (t). If the perceived risk exceeds another threshold T r;i (termed the threshold of infection risk), an individual will also adopt. The individualized thresholds (T p;i and T r;i ) reflect personal characteristics of individuals, while the events of evaluation represent the inter-personal influence between individuals. In such a way, the diffusion of disease elevates the perceived risks of individuals, and stimulates them to adopt preventive behavior.

Generally, it is not so much the actual risk of being infected, as the perceived risk of infection, that will prompt humans to change their vaccination behavior. Previous game-theoretic studies of vaccination behavior typically have often assumed that individuals react to the disease incidence with same responsive dynamics, i.e., the same formulas of calculating the perceived probability of infection. But that may not actually be the case. Liu et al. proposed that a few will be ""committed"" to vaccination, perhaps because they have a low threshold for feeling at risk (or strongly held convictions), and they will want to be immunized as soon as they hear that someone is infected [87] . They studied how the presence of committed vaccinators, a small fraction of individuals who consistently hold the vaccinating strategy and are immune to influence, impacts the vaccination dynamics in well-mixed and spatially structured populations. The researchers showed that even a relatively small proportion of these agents (such as 5%) can significantly reduce the scale of an epidemic, as shown in Fig. 4 . The effect is much stronger when all the individuals are uniformly distributed on a square lattice, as compared to the case of well-mixed population. Their results suggested that those committed individuals can have a remarkable effect, acting as ""steadfast role models"" in the population to seed vaccine uptake in others while also disrupting the appearance of clusters of free-riders, which might otherwise seed the emergence of a global epidemic. One important message taken away from Ref. [87] is that we might never guess what would happen by just looking at the decision-making rules alone, in particular when our choices will influence, and be influenced by, the choice of other people. Another good example can be found in a recent work [89] , in which Zhang et al. proposed an evolutionary epidemic game where individuals can choose their strategies as vaccination, self-protection or laissez faire, towards infectious diseases and adjust their strategies according to their neighbors' strategies and payoffs. The ""disease-behavior"" coupling dynamical process is similar to the one implemented by Ref. [85] , where the SIR epidemic spreading process and the strategy updating process succeed alternatively. By both stochastic simulations and theoretical analysis, the authors found a counter-intuitive phenomenon that a better condition (i.e., larger successful rate of self-protection) may unfortunately result in less system payoff. The trick is that, when the successful rate of self-protection increases, people become more speculative and less interested in vaccination. Since a vaccinated individual brings the ""externality"" effect to the system: the individual's decision to vaccinate diminishes not only its own risk of infection, but also the risk for those people with whom the individual interacts, the reduction of vaccination can remarkably enhance the risk of infection. The observed counter-intuitive phenomenon is reminiscent of the well-known Braess's Paradox in traffic, where more roads may lead to more severe traffic congestion [90] . This work provides another interesting example analogous to Braess's Paradox, namely, a higher successful rate of self-protection may eventually enlarge the epidemic size and thus diminish positive health outcomes.",12.93757627536073,9.855474274806431

These advances are fueled by new antibody screening and isolation technologies, a better understanding of how to construct and use non-immune and immune antibody repertoires, and growing interest in virology. The emergence of new viral pathogens has also kept the field ablaze, in part because the globalization Box 2 Antibody-dependent enhancement ADE is a mechanism by which virus-specific antibodies enhance viral entry into-and in some cases, replication in-monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells through interaction with Fcγ and/or complement receptors. ADE has been demonstrated in vitro using anti-dengue and anti-WNV antibodies and cells bearing Fcγ receptors, as well as in monkeys infused with anti-dengue antibodies 36, 75, [91] [92] [93] . ADE is the proposed mechanism responsible for Dengue hemorrhagic fever and Dengue shock syndrome, two clinical conditions that are frequently seen in patients infected with a second heterotropic infection or in infants with maternally transferred anti-Dengue antibodies. Infection with Dengue virus or any other flavivirus induces broadly cross-reactive, but weakly neutralizing as well as non-neutralizing antibodies 94, 95 . ADE occurs when the concentration of neutralizing antibody falls below the stoichiometric threshold for neutralization and becomes sub-neutralizing. These preexisting sub-neutralizing (and non-neutralizing) antibodies and the infecting Dengue virus form complexes that bind to Fcγ receptorbearing cells, leading to increased virus uptake and replication 36,37,75 . of world travel has increased the risk for rapid transmission and dissemination of new viral diseases. There is also a growing realization that for some viral pathogens, optimal disease prevention and management may not be achieved through traditional vaccination of the population at risk, but rather through instituting local, regional and international public health-care measures early to prevent and contain the infections, as was successfully demonstrated in the case of SARS 67 . In situations where the frequency of viral infection is low, protection could be provided by passive immunotherapy during the period of high-risk exposure, avoiding the potential side effects of vaccination that can cause untoward morbidity and even rare mortality, as exemplified by yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease 68 . Moreover, for some antiviral vaccines, high titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies are either not elicited, or their titers wane over time. In either case, the nAb titers may not be protective at the time of viral challenge, which may occur years after vaccination. Another possible risk is ADE for vaccines against viruses for which enhanced disease-associated clinical syndromes have been demonstrated and/or postulated to occur when antibody titers fall below their neutralization threshold (Box 2). In other cases, dominant antibody responses may be stronger against the vaccine strain than a secondary viral challenge stain, a phenomenon known as 'original antigenic sin' 69 . In all of the above examples, the use of short-term passive immunotherapy where high titer of nAbs can be readily achieved may provide some tangible advantages over vaccination.",14.543359941059329,7.824675469631842

Vaccination is widely employed as an infection control measure. To explore the role of individual imitation behavior and population structure in vaccination, recent seminal work integrated an epidemiological process into a simple agent-based model of adaptive learning, where individuals use anecdotal evidence to estimate costs and benefits of vaccination [85] . Under such a model, the disease-behavior dynamics is modeled as a two-stage process. The first stage is a public vaccination campaign, which occurs before any epidemic spreading. At this stage, each individual decides whether or not to vaccinate, and taking vaccine incurs a cost C V to the vaccinated individuals. The vaccine is risk-free and offers perfect protection against infection. The second stage is the disease transmission process, where the classic SIR compartmental model is adopted. During the whole epidemic spreading process, those susceptible individuals who caught the disease incur an infection cost C I , which is usually assumed to be larger than the cost C V for vaccination. Those unvaccinated individuals who remain healthy are free-riding off the vaccination efforts of others (i.e., no any cost), and they are indirectly protected by herd immunity. For simplicity, the authors rescale these costs by defining the relative cost of vaccination c = C V /C I (0 < c < 1) and C I = 1. As such, after each epidemic season, all the individuals will get some payoffs (equal to the negative value of corresponding costs) dependent on their vaccination strategies and also on whether they are infected or not, then they are allowed to change or keep their old strategies for the next season, depending on their current payoffs. The rule of thumb is that the strategy of a role model with higher payoff is more likely to be imitated. By doing so, each individual i randomly chooses another individual j from the neighborhood as role model, and imitates the behavior of j with the probability",12.92663096117559,7.244952030526141

Implementation of precautionary behaviour is largely dependent on effective risk communication, i.e. communication that induces realistic risk perceptions, correct knowledge and skills to promote and enable precautionary practices. Scientific knowledge about these topics in the area of infectious disease control is scarce. Neither is there knowledge if the theories and measures developed for risk perception research on, for example chronic diseases, can be applied in the area of infectious diseases. However, such knowledge is vital for effective control of newly emerging infectious diseases, because our ability to promote health protective behavioural change depends on our knowledge of important determinants of such behaviour [15] . For people to voluntarily engage in precautionary actions, they first of all need to be aware of the risk. Risk perception is a central feature in many health behaviour theories. According to the Protection Motivation Theory, for example [16] , protection motivation is the result of the threat appraisal and coping appraisal. Threat appraisal consists of estimates of the chance of contracting a disease (perceived vulnerability or susceptibility) and estimates of seriousness of a disease (perceived severity).",11.565489484893462,7.15146650861652

Indeed, with increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and the continued paucity of antiviral drugs against many viruses, vaccination is the most attractive approach to infectious disease control. Although vaccination has been practised for over 200 years and there are many licensed vaccines used today, recent advances in molecular biology and immunology combined with our understanding of the pathogenesis of many infectious agents, stimulated renewed interest in developing safer and more efficacious vaccines. This is evident by the increased number of articles directly focusing on vaccines and the genesis of new journals dedicated specifically to vaccinology. These activities are focused on both improving conventional vaccines and their delivery to meet the needs of today's management systems as well as developing totally new approaches to vaccination.",14.73924457376971,6.685207957734872

Over a 3-year period, a series of clinical studies was undertaken in which young adults were vaccinated with either inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Molecular signatures for predicting antibody responses were identified by combining gene expression profiling, antibody response data, real-time PCR analysis and DAMIP. The resulting predictive signature consisted of genes with known roles in antibody response and other genes with previously unidentified roles in antibody or B cell responses. For example, one gene from the predictive signature, CAMK4, encodes CaMKIV kinase, a protein known at the time to be involved in multiple immune system processes. However, it was not known if it had a role in antibody responses 25 . To demonstrate the ability of the systems biology approaches used in this study to identify biologically significant targets,CAMK4-knockout mice were vaccinated with TIV and exhibited significantly higher antibody titers on days 7, 14, and 28 days after vaccination compared with wild-type mice, thus confirming the hypothesis that CAMK4 is important in regulating B cell responses. Although further investigations are needed to confirm many of these signature predictions, these studies demonstrate that systems approaches can both identify biological targets and generate new testable hypotheses related to the mechanism of vaccine action.",12.654818599651701,6.466064475805219

Transmission occurs when an infected tick (various species within the Ixodes genera, also referred to as ''hard ticks'') bites and remains attached to a host, in this case, a puppy. Direct horizontal transmission is not likely to occur; therefore, the risk to human beings and other pets is thought to be minimal. If a puppy has a significant burden with infected ticks, this, of course, increases the exposure to others in the household; however, because ticks typically do not reattach once they have taken a complete meal, the risk is thought to be quite small unless appropriate tick control is not instituted [29] . Vaccination to protect against Lyme disease is controversial, because the duration of immunity and degree of protection provided by vaccination are unknown and vaccination with some vaccines interferes with standard screening diagnostics [30] . Therefore, vaccination against Lyme disease is warranted only if a puppy is at high risk for tick exposure and only if it lives in a Borrelia endemic area. There are killed and recombinant (outer surface protein A [OspA] subunit) vaccines available for use against B burgdorferi, and if vaccination is deemed warranted, the current recommendation is to use one of the subunit vaccines before exposure to ticks. The vaccine can be given as early as 9 weeks of age and should be repeated 3 to 4 weeks later [28] . The best prophylaxis is likely achieved by using appropriate tick prevention, such as fipronil with methoprene spray or spot-on products (Frontline Top Spot; Merial Ltd, Iselin, New Jersey), amitraz collars (Preventic collar; Virbac, Fort Worth, Texas), or an imidacloprid/permethrin topical product (Canine Advantix; Bayer Animal Health, Shawnee Mission, Kansas) [30, 31] .

There is some controversy about the optimal timing of vaccination posttransplant, but the prudent approach is to vaccinate SOT patients as soon as the seasonal vaccine is available before influenza season. The efficacy of vaccination may be lower in SOT patients than in immunocompetent patients, but does appear to be safe. One study found that of the population of SOT patients diagnosed with influenza, 50% had received the vaccination and none of these patients had protective levels of antibodies against influenza at the time of admission. The same study showed that influenza vaccination decreased the risk of associated pneumonia (relative risk 0.3) in comparison with SOT patients who were not immunized. 15 There is no evidence that additional benefit is gained from highdose vaccines or intradermal inoculation. The live attenuated nasal vaccine is contraindicated in immunocompromised persons, including those who have received a SOT. Evidence does not show an increased risk for graft rejection or failure with influenza vaccination. 16 Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in SOT patients is common (3 times higher incidence than in immunocompetent individuals) and dangerous (11%-43% mortality rate). 17, 18 A Canadian case-control study found that immunosuppressive medications increased the risk for CAP, with an odds ratio of 15. 17 Despite the uniquely higher risk facing SOT patients, the IDSA and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) do not specifically consider immunosuppressed patients in their consensus guidelines for CAP. Rather, the guidelines address CAP and separate guidelines address nosocomial pneumonia (recent hospitalization or institutional settings). 19 For this patient, the presentation in the 3-to 6-month posttransplant period increases her risk for opportunistic infections, given the effects of longer duration and higher dose of immunosuppressive medications. Viral infections such as CMV and respiratory viruses can cause primary lung infections during this time, and can also complicate matters by further decreasing immunity and increasing the risk for opportunistic infections such as Aspergillus fumigatus and PJP. 10 ",11.435976846503014,8.02819056532818

First, individuals are assumed to spontaneously evaluate the proportion of adopters among their contacts, and perceive the pressure of adoption. Once the perceived pressure reaches a threshold (hereinafter called the threshold of adoption pressure), an individual will decide to adopt preventive behavior. Second, in order to relate the preventive behavior to infectious diseases, individuals also evaluate the proportion of infected individuals (with disease symptoms) among their contacts, and perceive the risks of infection. Once the perceived risk reaches another threshold (hereinafter called the threshold of infection risk), an individual will also adopt preventive behavior. These two threshold effects can be further formulized as three characteristics and two behaviors of individuals. The three characteristics include an adoption status (adopter or non-adopter) and two individualized thresholds toward adoption. The two behaviors represent the individual's evaluation of adoption pressure and infection risk from surrounding contacts, which in turn determines their adoption status. The individualized thresholds toward adoption reflect personal characteristics of individuals, while the behaviors of evaluation represent the inter-personal influence between individuals.

Traditional vaccine approaches rely on generating protective serum neutralizing antibodies, which are a correlate of protection following vaccination against common childhood diseases including diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, and rubella, among others [93] . Such protection has been extremely successful in reducing morbidity and mortality. In some cases, however, circulating antibody responses are unable to provide efficient cross protection between distinct serotypes or strains of the same pathogen, such as for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or influenza, and in other cases, circulating antibody responses do not appear to provide consistent, lasting protective immunity leading to limited protection by antibody-based vaccines as in the case of pertussis vaccines [93] .",10.89732538836235,6.794227126359562

These diseases have become more prominent in the wake of policies to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal production. This has led to more research focused on better understanding the immune system and its responses to pathogen challenge, and thus developing informed strategies to exploit immune responses that can support enhanced disease resistance and growth performance. Some chicken breeds and lines show greater resistance or susceptibility to various diseases, and thus these birds maybe able to shed light on immune processes or pathways that contribute to the more resistant/susceptible state. This review attempts to identify potentially important genes that show some consistency in (relative) up or downregulation in key tissues between the resistant and susceptible chickens. For coccidiosis and NE, relative downregulation of IL-10 and (slightly less consistently) upregulation of IFNγ appear to be features of more resistant birds. Data for IFN-α, IL-12, and IL-17D are currently less consistent. Gene expression data from NE studies have identified some potentially interesting, perhaps less well understood, immune-related genes (e.g., TCF12, BCL2, IRF2, TRAF3, TAB3, etc.,) that maybe associated with the resistant and/or susceptible phenotype. Salmonella and Campylobacter are important foodborne pathogens harbored by the chicken intestinal tract, while infectious bursal disease and infectious bronchitis are also important viral diseases of poultry. We, therefore, consider whether there are consistent features from resistant/susceptible disease models with these pathogens that relate to findings from the coccidiosis and NE studies. It is not anticipated that ideal immune responses to these pathogens will be identical but rather that consistent elements maybe identified that could help inform breeding or alternative strategies to support general disease resistance and enhanced (and efficient) flock productivity.",12.062033816756806,6.7868934845961135

Factors promoting protective T cell responses by vaccines, however, are not well understood and even less is known about requirements for TRM establishment and the capacities of infants to generate TRM. Recent vaccine studies in mice have demonstrated that mucosal administration of antigen or vaccination combined with local chemokines or other molecules necessary for T cell homing is important for the establishment of t i s s u e -l o c a l i z e d T c e l l r e s p o n s e s [ 1 2 , 9 6 -9 8 ] . Furthermore, administration of live-attenuated vaccine formulations can establish protective TRM in several distinct tissue-localized animal disease models [97, 98] . Moreover, children vaccinated at birth with BCG, a liveattenuated vaccine, generated circulating T cells producing adult-like, Th1-mediated IFN-γ responses [99] . Significantly, this work demonstrated both the capacity of young children to generate T cell responses to vaccination as well as robust Th1-type functionality. Interestingly, neonatal mice immunized with incomplete Freund's adjuvant generate Th2-biased responses while complete Freund's adjuvant, containing mycobacterial-derived components, promotes Th1-polarized responses [57] illustrating that the inflammatory nature of an immunization significantly influences the quality of the subsequent T cell response, even very early in life. Studies of influenza vaccination further highlight differing immune and specifically T cell responses to inactivated (IIV) versus live-attenuated (LAIV) vaccines early in life. Compared to older children and adults, children under four receiving IIV demonstrated reduced induction of serum-neutralizing antibody responses and antibody-secreting cells compared to older children and adults [100] . Following immunization with IIV, neonatal mice showed impaired generation of Tfh important for antibody and germinal center responses [101] that could be restored with additional stimulation by the adjuvant MF59 [102] , suggesting impaired Tcell help during infancy. Live-attenuated influenza virus vaccine (LAIV) elicits measurable circulating, virusspecific T cell responses in infants and young children which are not observed in adults [103] . Furthermore, in a previous study, LAIV provided enhanced protection against the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness in children compared to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) [104] and this protection was superior to that observed in adults [104] . Whether this protection was mediated by T cells in humans is not known, recent mouse studies demonstrate that LAIV generates protective lung TRM, while vaccination with IIV does not [88] . Vaccination of infant mice with LAIV resulted in reduced TRM generation compared to adults, consistent with their intrinsic impairments in TRM differentiation [84] The in vivo efficacy of LAIV in young children can vary between seasons [105] , and more studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of tissue localized to circulating responses.",11.219148540194759,6.540868219031468

The most effective mitigation strategies to prepare for the consequences of an outbreak would be to plan for the home quarantine of patients, establish public information strategies to reduce public concern, close affected facilities until conditions permit their safe reopening, plan for a coordinated information and command and control center, and have preestablished protocols and procedures in place to protect the health of health care workers and first responders. 24 Vaccination is an essential component of hospital and community mitigation planning. During the fall of 2002, the U.S. government requested that all states prepare for a smallpox attack. The preparations called for each state to present plans to vaccinate all persons within the state, within a 10-day period, starting with health care workers. 25 Each facility and community needs to look at the risk of a disease, the effect of vaccination on health care workers, and the ability to maintain continuity of care. One outcome of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was that several organizations, including the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommended that health care workers be mandated to receive yearly influenza vaccinations, which helps to minimize the risk that they will transmit influenza to high-and low-risk patients and bring influenza home to their families. If properly informed and vaccinated, health care workers could respond and treat patients without risk to themselves or their families. The availability of a vaccine and the ability to mass-vaccinate the majority of the population should be considered in all community response plans.

Cumulative vaccinated proportion in each subgroup is shown in Fig. 8(A) , which demonstrates that targeting strategy remains similar with changes in vaccination coverage. As vaccination coverage decreases, number of vaccinated decreases, resulting in an increase in the overall number of infected (Fig. 7A2-C2) . Optimal control is more efficient than other strategies in terms of reduction under all vaccination coverage (Fig. 7A3-C3) .

She provided an overview of basic concepts regarding heterologous and homologous immunity in response to serial infections with different serotypes, and a comprehensive update on current understanding of performance characteristics of the only licensed dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV, ®Dengvaxia, by Sanofi-Pasteur). Dengue is the single most important arboviral infection in terms of disease burden, with more than 3.6 billion people at risk for infection and an estimated 390 million infections annually in over 120 tropical and sub-tropical countries. In the absence of truly effective and sustainable vector control measures, dengue vaccines are considered a key component in prevention programs. Deployment of Dengvaxia has been complicated by significant controversy because vaccine responses are driven by an individuals' serostatus; vaccination of individuals who are seronegative at the time of inoculation will elicit immunity akin to that following a primary infection, and thus generate risk for antibody-dependent enhancement, with higher risk of severe disease upon subsequent dengue infection. In contrast, vaccination of individuals who are seropositive has been shown to have at least 72% efficacy to protect against subsequent symptomatic infection (Sridhar et al. N Engl J Med 2018 Jul 26:379(4):327-340). The WHO initially recommended (April 2016) that the vaccine should be deployed only in areas with seroprevalence > 70%. However, in 2017, more definitive evidence from a retrospective analysis of clinical trial data revealed an excess of severe dengue in seronegative vaccine recipients. The WHO SAGE (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts) working group was therefore obliged to reconsider guidelines for how to best use the vaccine (http://www.who. int/immunization/sage/previous/en/index.html) and to evaluate under which circumstances there may be a net public health benefit versus individual risk. The key consideration was whether WHO should recommend countries to conduct population seroprevalence studies to measure endemicity levels prior to vaccine introductions; or rather to develop individual-based pre-vaccination screening programs. Both approaches present challenges due to cross-reactive dengue seroassays. The talk concluded with a discussion of other dengue vaccines under development, including chimeric vaccines from Takeda and Butantan, for which clinical phase III trials are underway.",14.85590249936942,7.959519373619629

The predominant form currently causing infection in the United States is type 2b, but other subtypes exist and cause disease elsewhere. 13 Because the virus is nonenveloped, it may exist (outside of a host) under certain environmental conditions, and is somewhat resistant to many disinfectants. Transmission is via the fecal-oral route, and clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, pyrexia, vomiting, and diarrhea (typically hemorrhagic). Young animals appear to be at highest risk for developing severe, life-threatening disease. The current recommendation for vaccination is to use a multivalent MLV vaccine beginning at 6 to 9 weeks and to repeat the vaccine at intervals as already stated (every 3-4 weeks, until the puppy is 14-16 weeks old). In the past there was concern that certain breeds may have been at increased risk for contracting and developing severe parvoviral disease (Doberman Pinschers, Rottweilers), but it is generally agreed that these breeds will mount an appropriate response to a quality product if the last vaccine is given between 14 and 16 weeks of age. 3, 13, 19 There is, however, a small population of dogs that is genetically unable to respond to vaccination against CPV2, regardless of the number of vaccinations (nonresponders). One benefit of having a well-vaccinated population is that even those nonresponders are at decreased risk of exposure and subsequent infection by parvovirus, based on strong herd immunity. Studies using MLV CPV2b strains showed a higher antibody response to CPV2 and CPV2b, and were better able to overcome maternal antibody interference than the CPV2-strain vaccines used 20, 21 ; however, all CPV2 vaccines currently available should produce strong immunity in immunocompetent dogs. Immunization 1 year after completing the initial puppy series is recommended, with subsequent triennial vaccinations. 3, 22, 23 There is also emerging evidence that Weimaraner puppies are at increased risk of developing a severe form of hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD) in association with vaccination with MLV distemper, adenoviral, and parvoviral products. The exact Vaccination Strategies in Puppies and Kittens mechanism is unknown, but the current recommendation is to use killed products in this breed for their pediatric vaccinations, and consider starting vaccinations when they are slightly older. 12 ",11.94705035927805,8.315073463569277

The vaccine recommendations are as stated for B bronchiseptica if indicated. There are Vaccination Strategies in Puppies and Kittens multiple products available, but the product currently recommended is the combination of intranasal vaccine containing a modified live parainfluenza virus with an attenuated B bronchiseptica bacterin. Intranasal vaccines can be used in puppies aged 3 to 4 weeks for individuals at high risk of exposure (depending on vaccine manufacturer label restrictions). For optimal protection, the vaccine should be administered every 6 months to annually if indicated. Alternatively many multivalent, parental products containing modified live CDV, CAV-II, CPV, and parainfluenza are available and appropriate for use. 3, 9 Borreliosis Borrelia burgdorferi is a vector-borne, spirochete bacterium responsible for Lyme disease (borreliosis). Transmission occurs when an infected tick (various species within the Ixodes genera, also referred to as hard ticks) bites and remains attached to a host, in this case a puppy. Direct, horizontal transmission is not likely to occur, so the risk to humans and other pets is thought to be minimal. If a puppy has a significant burden with infected ticks, it of course increases the exposure to others in the household but, as ticks typically do not reattach once they have taken a complete meal, the risk is considered to be fairly small unless appropriate tick control is not instituted. 28 Vaccination to protect against Lyme disease is controversial, as the duration of immunity and degree of protection provided by vaccination is unknown, and vaccination with some vaccines interferes with standard screening diagnostics. 29 Therefore, vaccination against Lyme disease is warranted only if a puppy will be expected to be at high risk for tick exposure, and only if it lives in a Borrelia-endemic area. There are killed and recombinant (OspA subunit) vaccines available for use against B burgdorferi, and if vaccination is deemed warranted, the current recommendation is to use one of the subunit vaccines before exposure to ticks. The vaccine can be given as early as 9 weeks and should be repeated 3 to 4 weeks later. 27 The best prophylaxis is likely achieved by using appropriate tick prevention, such as fipronil with methoprene spray or spot-on products (eg, Frontline Top Spot; Merial Ltd, Iselin, NJ), amitraz collars (eg, Preventic collar; Virbac Animal Health, Fort Worth, TX), or an imidacloprid/permethrin topical product (eg, Canine Advantix; Bayer Animal Health, Shawnee Mission, KS). 29, 30 These products should be chosen and recommended carefully by the veterinarian based on household situations, owner concerns, and the age of the puppy.",12.529947260016904,7.714479796735592

Suppose that the contact pattern is homogeneous in both populations, and assuming that the frequencies of contact are not different between A and B, how different are the risks of infection of a vaccinated individual in the center of these populations? Obviously, the risk in population A is higher than that in B, because individuals surrounding striped (vaccinated) individual in population A are mainly unvaccinated. In other words, even if the vaccination does not offer perfect protection, individuals in population B can enjoy better community benefit compared to that in population A. The community benefit extends to those who would have been infected by the vaccinee, had he developed the disease. Consequently, vaccinees are not only protected to their own benefit, but to the benefit of the community, and moreover, unvaccinated individuals are susceptible not only to their own adversity, but to the adversity of the community. The degree of community protection is referred to as herd immunity [40, 62, 77] . When it comes to the assessment of vaccination, this is also referred to as indirect effect of vaccination. Because of the presence of herd immunity, disease eradication (e.g. of smallpox) was (and can be for other diseases) achieved without vaccinating all susceptible individuals.

Thus, the public health gains for such an intervention need to be compelling and must offset the cost of development and implementation. The goal is far easier to justify when vaccination also prevents disease in an economically valuable animal species, there is a profit incentive for animal vaccination or a clear social gain from improved animal health, and when the public health spin-off is an added benefit. Examples of the latter may include vaccines against Hendra and Nipah virus diseases, Brucellosis, Chlamydophila felis, Rift Valley fever, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis. The potential for elimination of a disease through vaccination (employed together with other strategies), as has been demonstrated for brucellosis in the US and terrestrial rabies in some European countries is a compelling economic concept, though applicable in only selected cases.

In dengue virus infections antibody enhanced entry occurs after previously infected individuals are re-infected with a second serotype of dengue virus.

In addition to HIV, there is opportunity for developing new vaccines and immunization programs for diseases of the developed world and even the more challenging targets that are prevalent in underdeveloped countries, such as Ebola fever, dengue, and hookworm disease. Careful analysis of the disease patterns of the populace can also point out the need for new immunization programs using modifications of established vaccines. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has long been a prospective target for vaccine development. Developing a vaccine against RSV has been a challenge, because antibody is insufficient for protection and inactivated vaccines that generate a predominantly antibody response (Th2) can promote exaggerated disease. An early formalin-inactivated alum-precipitated vaccine enhanced disease, and temperature-sensitive live-attenuated intranasal vaccines were ineffective. Jonathan Klein-Evans (MedImmune Inc.) very effectively described several different approaches that have been taken towards an RSV vaccine. These include subunit vaccines with purified viral glycoproteins, a polypeptide vaccine, DNA vaccines expressing the F and G glycoproteins of the virus, and live virus vectors including vaccinia virus, bovine parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus which express the F and G glycoproteins (11) . Med-Immune Inc. developed a cold-passaged temperature-sensitive attenuated viral vaccine by passage of RSV at temperatures less than 32°C. This virus can establish upper respiratory infections but cannot replicate in the warmer environment of the lungs. Phase I/II trials of this vaccine have been promising. He stressed the importance of keeping the patent lawyers, like himself, involved in the vaccine development process to secure the company's investment in new technologies (12) .",13.039088144140738,7.774528860035593

Although this is an important part of prevention and treatment strategies, the cause may be more symptomatic rather than a major risk factor, particularly as it applies to secondary bacterial pathogens. Most cow/calf herds are maintained in multiple pasture units on a single operation. Exposure within these units to potential pathogens is common. In many herds, pathogens such as BRSV have likely become endemic and are not likely to cause significant clinical disease in well-vaccinated herds. In herd situations with exposure to BVDV persistent infection (PI) animals in the absence of other risk factors may result in clinical disease. 34 Exposure to cattle from other operations may present a pathogen risk because naive cattle exposed to the common viral pathogens such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), BRSV, BVDV, and BRCV as well as the bacterial pathogen such as Mycoplasma bovis 35, 36 may cause clinical disease in the absence of other apparent risk factors. The risk posed by these viral pathogens is readily reduced by herd vaccination programs. The use of modified live virus (MLV) vaccines greatly decreases shedding of these viruses and reduces the risk of clinical disease. The pathogen previously characterized as Pasteurella trehalosi and recently renamed Bibersteinia trehalosi has long been recognized as a cause of ovine respiratory disease in small ruminants. 37, 38 Its role in acute cases of respiratory disease in young dairy and stocker calves seems to be increasing and may be influenced by the use of prophylactic antibiotics given to control other pathogens. 39 Vaccination to control bacterial pathogens gives mixed results in the field.

In the simplest case this can be taken as a constant (e.g., as in [8] ), though individuals' perceptions about a given vaccine are possibly affected by perceptions about other vaccines as well. On the other hand the perceived benefit of vaccination can be estimated by the perceived risk of suffering death (or serious morbidity) from the disease, which can in turn be estimated as the product of some measure of the current perceived risk of acquiring infection, i.e., the force of infection, and the conditional probability of death, as a consequence of infection. European data suggest that, due to improved nutrition and sanitation, the probability of death following infection from measles and other childhood infections fell off at least two orders of magnitude from 4 We shortly mention that there are also a number of a priori opposers to vaccinations, who irrationally believe that vaccines are a sort of Manzoni's ""ointments."" Quite interestingly, this observation is in line with the fact that some anti-vaccination arguments remained unchanged since the Jenner's times [107] . 5 Although out of the aims of this work, we remark here that the partisans of most extreme anti-vaccination positions are very able in spreading their ideas through the World Wide Web [107] , so that WWW 2.0 might represent not only an opportunity but also a challenge for vaccination decisions [12] .

As for the risk of infection, the simple endemic SIR model with immunization at birth [3] suggests that for highly transmissible infection as measles, with a basic reproduction number about 15, a vaccine uptake of approximately 90 %, as was typical in many European countries during the last two decades, would create strong herd immunity by decreasing both the endemic prevalence and the risk of infection by about 30 times compared to the case of no vaccination. This straightforwardly yields the perception that the infection is no longer circulating.

In the models considering the interaction between the effects of vaccination and household, reflecting the contextual effect of the environment, the estimated protective effect of vaccination was enhanced, and the 95% CI departed from zero. To show the differences among Becker's linear logistic model, the Bayesian hierarchical model with random intercepts, and the latter model with random slopes, we illustrated these three models using estimated results based on the Greenwood model with a generation effect by simulating the logit predicted values of the vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects of ten households and by controlling for covariates at the subject level, considering ages between 6 and 65 years and females. there was no variation between households, and 10 lines overlapped (Fig. 3, first column) . The intercepts of the logit-predicted values increased from −2.81 in the first generation (Fig. 3 , first column and first row) to −2.02 in the fourth generation (Fig. 3 , first column and fourth row), showing that the risk of being vulnerable to influenza increased as the epidemic evolved. In the random-intercept model based on the Greenwood model (Fig. 3, second column) , the trend of increasing the risk of being vulnerable to influenza with successive generations was preserved, and the spread of the logit-predicted values of the ten simulated household are shown as parallel lines due to the α 0h term in the model specified in (4), which represents the heterogeneity in the baseline risk of being vulnerable to influenza across households and the contextual effect. Regarding the Greenwood model with a random slope (Fig. 3, third column) , the variation between households shows the effect on the slope (β 0h , model specified in (8)), representing the interaction between the effect of vaccination and the contextual effect. Moreover, it is notable that the heterogeneity in the slope is much greater than that of the intercept after separating the generation effect from the baseline risk.

Therefore, the influenza vaccine is recommended for all women who will be pregnant during influenza season, regardless of gestational age (57) . Varicella vaccination is recommended for susceptible women considering pregnancy at 1-3 months before pregnancy or post-partum. Vaccination may reduce the risk of congenital varicella syndrome and decrease morbidity from adult complications of varicella. The varicella vaccine is not recommended for use during pregnancy because it is a live-attenuated vaccine (78) . The current pneumococcal vaccine contains the purified capsular polysaccharide from the 23 serotypes that cause 85-90% of the infections. The vaccine is effective in decreasing the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia and is recommended to women with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, asplenia, sickle cell disease, diabetes, or chronic cardiopulmonary disease (44) . It may be given during pregnancy in women with the listed risk factors (79) .

When abortions occur in a herd, all fetal materials should be submitted, along with maternal blood, to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory for infectious disease testing. The dam should be isolated from the herd, as for a newly added animal, and monitored for further clinical signs of disease. If an infectious agent is identified, vaccination against that agent may be considered as part of a comprehensive herd health-preventive program to minimize risk. Leptospirosis has been diagnosed in SACs 79 and causes both reproductive and renal disease. In herds or areas where leptospirosis is an endemic disease, vaccination with multivalent bovine vaccines may be performed. Alpacas have been vaccinated experimentally and measured-antibody response has occurred. 80 There is evidence of short-lived immunity in alpacas vaccinated against Leptospira 80 and it is recommended that highrisk farms vaccinate females before breeding and again at mid-gestation. 76 This vaccine may need to be given up to four times annually in endemic areas where wildlife and contaminated water-source exposure cannot be controlled. 42 Another potential abortive agent, Chlamydiophila (formerly Chlamydia), isolated from infected fetal materials, may be vaccinated against, with good serologic responses to sheeplabeled vaccines. 76 In 2007, Dubovi reported on the testing of 12,000 alpaca samples submitted to Cornell University for BVDV testing. 81 These samples revealed a 0.15% prevalence of persistent infection with serum-neutralizing antibodies present in 14% of 268 samples submitted for serology. Persistent infection, pyrexia, ill thrift, abortions, and stillbirths have been associated with BVDV infection in camelids. 47, 50, 51 Although disease has not been successfully created experimentally, 49 it is believed that persistently infected crias are the greatest source of infection and, as such, should be euthanized. The study of 43 strains of BVDV isolated from alpacas in a large geographic area showed that 42 of 43 were genetically similar, falling into one of two groups. That these strains could potentially be traced to a common origin makes testing and elimination of persistently infected animals the highest priority for control. 81 Vaccination of camelids against BVDV is not currently recommended because of potential interference with diagnostic testing 81 and lack of efficacy or safety information.",13.265745137827313,10.1644858033894

These data suggest that the N protein not only fails to provide protection from disease in these acute replication models, it also promotes enhanced disease pathogenesis in the lung. The evaluation of several formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines suggest these vaccines primarily induce a Th2 response while natural SARS-CoV infection of humans induces primarily a Th1 response (Spruth et al. 2006; Tsunetsugu-Yokota et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2004) . Given the data from both FI-RSV and FI-MV vaccination where the alteration of the natural Th response induced more severe disease upon challenge, caution should be used in developing vectored vaccines containing SARS-CoV N or formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines which may promote rather than prevent disease.

These novel approaches include the direct introduction of plasmid DNA containing the gene encoding the antigen against which an immune response is sought by incorporating antigens into appropriate host tissues and the in situ production of the target antigen(s). The advantages of this approach over traditional approaches are that it stimulates both B-and T-cell responses, the vaccine has improved stability, the absence of any infectious agents, and the relative ease of large-scale manufacture [93] . Vaccines are generally used as biological medicinal products for the prophylaxis of infectious disease, but DNA vaccines are also being developed for therapeutic use (eg, against infectious disease or other diseases such as cancer). Using genes from a variety of infectious agents, including influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, rabies virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus, malaria, and mycoplasma, many scientific publications [93] explore the potential of DNA vaccination and immune responses in animals. For nucleic acid and viral vector-based vaccines, biodistribution studies are necessary to determine the tissue distribution following administration and the potential for the vector to integrate into the host genome [93, 94] . The design of nonclinical safety tests should take into consideration the use of the DNA vaccine and the risk/benefit situation. In addition to following GLP requirements for preclinical toxicology studies (see above), DNA studies should also evaluate any local inflammatory response (eg, myositis), organ-specific autoimmunity, immunopathology, and other relevant parameters. In particular, where the encoded antigen is a self-antigen, or may show self-antigen mimicry, a wider range of studies (including autoantibodies) may be necessary to address the specific concerns [93] .",13.52485731207138,6.998709241916556

In the 1960s, an attempt to vaccinate children with a formalininactivated HRSV vaccine failed when enhanced disease was reported after subsequent HRSV infection of vaccinated infants. 3, 4 A vaccine against HRSV is not currently available and a major obstacle for development of a vaccine is that the immunological mechanisms leading to either protection or enhanced disease has not been clarified. It seems that part of the illness caused by natural HRSV infection is because of the host immune response. 5, 6 For some years RSV serum antibodies were thought to play a role in the enhanced disease, 7 but passive antibody prophylaxis has shown that antibodies cause an acceleration of virus clearance without harmful effects 8, 9 although there was no improvement in the pulmonary pathology either. 10 A systemic cell-mediated sensitization has also been suggested to contribute to the altered response to natural HRSV infection that occurred after use of inactivated HRSV vaccine. 11 In this context the mouse model has been used intensively to study the association between T-cell subpopulations and immunemediated disease. 12 However, most of this work has focused on the vaccine-enhanced disease whereas there is a lack of investigation into the pathogenesis of the primary infection.

The first is that overexpression of CCL2 by astrocytes results in an influx and accumulation of normal monocytes/macrophages into the CNS. These cells are not activated and there is no evidence of inflammatory lesions or spontaneous inflammatory disease or histologic disease. These monocytes/macrophages have the capacity to be activated as a peripheral challenge of the JE32 transgenic mice with LPS-induced organized CNS mononuclear cell lesions. These lesions are presumably due to the activation of monocytes/macrophages previously recruited to the CNS as a result of CCL2 overexpression. During the normal TMEV disease process, CCL2 is expressed in the CNS of infected mice (Hoffman et al, 1999) and anti-CCL2 treatment results in decreased monocyte accumulation in the CNS (manuscript submitted). These findings support the idea that enhanced disease as a result of transgenic overexpression of CCL2 is due to enhanced monocyte accumulation. However, from the histology data, it cannot be ruled out that either LPS challenge or TMEV infection induced the activation of microglia to form inflammatory foci resembling an accumulation of monocytes/macrophages.",14.969279527505353,8.013740503732404

Linde (Solna, SE) Children are the engines of influenza epidemics in interpandemic years. They have no or limited immunity to circulating virus strains, and therefore the age-specific attack rate is highest among children. Twenty to twenty-five per cent of young children may contract the disease yearly. The main complication is otitis media, and 5-8 children per100 are prescribed antibiotics yearly indirectly due to influenza. The risk for hospitalisation is highest in children below 2 years of age, and has been estimated to be 103/105 person months. Main reasons for hospitalisation are suspected septicaemia, lower respiratory tract infection, asthma/bronchitis and febrile seizures. Influenza infection is normally self-limiting in children, but fatalities occur. Children with severe heart and/or lung disease or other severely debilitating disease belong to risk groups of severe influenza like adults. During the influenza season 2003-2004 more than 140 children were reported dead due to influenza in the US, and in Japan there has been several cases of lethal encphalopathia in influenza-infected children during recent years. Most of the dead children did not belong to any known risk group. Influenza may thus be a severe disease among children, and children below three years of age are most vulnerable. The ordinary influenza vaccine is more reactogenic in children that adults, and vaccination of children demands two doses. With a good strain match, vaccination has a protective efficacy of 70-90%, and it may reduce the incidence of otitis media with around 30%. In the US vaccination of children of 0.6 to 23 months has been recommended since 1993. The measure is regarded cost-effective, and it may also be diminish the spread of influenza to the elderly. Despite this, no European country recommends general influenza vaccination of children, and even the rate of vaccination of vulnerable children at risk of complicated disease is low. One reason may be an unproven fear that vaccination may prevent the development of basic immunity against influenza. Intranasal vaccination with live, cold-adapted virus has proven to induce similar heterolgous immunity to drifted influenza strains as wild-type infection in children, and a large study of the vaccine has recently been conducted in Europe. The outcome has not been published (Jan 2006), but if successful it may be an attractive option for prevention of the consequences of influenza in children.",14.088425346746973,6.532246163474745

A phenomenon that has militated against their widespread application has been that of antibodydependent enhancement of disease. That is, antibodies induced by a first infection or vaccination may enhance the disease caused by a subsequent infection. Infection of cats by FCoV usually results in an infection confined largely to the digestive tract. In some cases the virus disseminates to other organs, leading to fatal infectious peritonitis. This dissemination is facilitated by macrophages. It is believed that uptake of FCoV by macrophages is enhanced when the virus has immunoglobulins, induced by a prior infection or vaccination, on its surface; the Fc moiety of the immunoglobulin attaches the virus-antibody complex to the surface of the macrophage (reviewd in [211] ; see also [212, 213] ).",13.017788664654695,8.01728358830465

Vaccination is a primary public health measure with the potential to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases, and hence reduce morbidity and mortality from infections [163] [164] [165] [166] . In most instances, vaccination is dependent on voluntary adoption rather than being enforced on the population at risk [165, [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [174] . Incorporating voluntary adoption into the models of disease dynamics completes a feedback loop as illustrated in Fig. 16 . Because one feedback in this loop is positive and the other is negative, the overall dynamics may exhibit cycles, which is exactly the case when vaccination-related decision making is represented by, say, game theory or other related constructs [175] [176] [177] [178] . As vaccination coverage increases, herd immunity emerges and effectively prevents the propagation of the disease. Yet, as a consequence of the low disease prevalence, vaccination enthusiasm decreases and the high risk of infection resurfaces. The described phenomenon has been empirically observed and quantitatively verified [175] . Furthermore, if voluntary vaccination is implemented in network populations, a somewhat counterintuitive result [179] [180] [181] [182] is that heterogeneity acts to inhibit the disease outbreak. This result is due to the fact that large-degree nodes have a disproportional effect in attracting neighboring nodes to adopt vaccination [183] . Finally, vaccination can be treated in the context of an opinion formation process, which happens to impede the attainment of full herd immunity [184] . Unvaccinated clusters may emerge and dramatically increases the disease outbreak probability even if the vaccination level is generally high.",14.578845858623827,5.839987773093169

For instance, projects such as Gapminder [38] have developed animations of world income distribution and global health that are easy to understand. However, to our knowledge, this work is the first to experimentally evaluate visualization strategies to communicate infectious disease prevalence to the general public. Numerous studies have evaluated the impact of graphics on risk communication [24, 25] . However, this prior work has primarily focused on communicating to individual patients-particularly the risks and benefits individuals would receive as a result of a medical procedure. While epidemiologists have long used graphical displays to illustrate the spread of disease [39, 40] , that work has focused on delivering information to highly trained public health specialists. In contrast, this study assesses graphics that communicate disease prevalence to the general population, simulating that their country is at the epicenter of an infectious disease outbreak. This type of communi-cation is especially relevant to public health and government officials seeking to provide broadly accessible health information. As the lay public receives more of its health information multidimensionally, from healthcare experts, news, and social media, it is critically important to evaluate the most appropriate graphics used to communicate disease prevalence, spread, and risk. Understanding optimal communication strategies is of particular importance in relation to influenza, where vaccination greatly reduces the risk of contracting disease [41, 42] ; yet, vaccination rates remain suboptimal [43] . Prior research related to public health communication and influenza has demonstrated that the general public prefers brief, balanced, and evidence-based messages [44] [45] [46] . However, there is currently no standard method for the graphical communication of epidemiological data to the lay public. The WHO and the CDC used a combination of dot and heat maps during the recent Ebola outbreak to depict prevalence [30, 31] . Dot maps appear most often in the literature [32, [47] [48] [49] . However, heat maps have been discussed infrequently in the literature. In one study of Europeans interested in weather forecasts, a color contour map featuring hypothetical forecasts was preferred over six other more typical formats of graphical presentation of data, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs [50] . Yet, we found that while both heat maps and pictotrendlines were preferred over dot maps, the use of heat maps to demonstrate the spread of disease increased interest in vaccination compared to the use of picto-trendlines and no differently than dot maps. Furthermore, dot maps appeared to be the worst method to convey information, as respondents with dot maps had less knowledge gained from the graphic compared to those with heat maps and picto-trendlines. Thus, unlike dot maps and picto-trendlines, heat maps achieved the trifecta-greater respondent preference, increased interest in vaccination, and better translation of knowledge. Graphics must also be carefully examined to assess both their potential positive and negative impact. Visuals can produce a wide variety of emotional responses that may be difficult to predict [23, 27] . Furthermore, it is often difficult to adequately illustrate uncertainty in risk communication [51] ; however, this becomes even more imperative when presenting graphics at the population level, since risk may vary greatly between individuals and across locations. Experimental evidence remains limited as to how different graphics are processed and understood [51] ; therefore, additional research is necessary to evaluate the impact of public health graphics aimed at the general population. In particular, it is unclear how other modes of communication, such as animations and videos, impact public health communication. Our prior work using animation in the context of cancer treatment options suggests that animated graphics may result in suboptimal risk communication [52] .",14.43253696265898,6.783769793372141

The risks of not vaccinating their stock on account of lack of awareness among the stakeholders, non-availability of costeffective diagnostics and vaccines, and poor delivery of veterinary services to the livestock farmers can have serious consequences on livelihoods of rural livestock producers. Effective vaccination programmes if implemented properly with a broader perspective are likely to reduce the need for antimicrobials, which in turn can help reduce the risk of emergent antimicrobial resistance. The World Veterinary Association (WVA) and Health for Animals believe that it is essential for the global veterinary profession to educate the public, particularly animal keepers and producers, about the benefits of vaccination for animals and humans. The major objectives and motive of veterinary vaccines are to protect, improve and promote the health and welfare of companion and food animals; increase the production of livestock in a cost-effective manner; and prevent animal-to-human transmission of infectious diseases from domestic animals and wildlife to humans through animal-origin food, close contact and other mechanisms. These diverse aims have led to different approaches to the development of veterinary vaccines from crude but effective whole-pathogen preparations to molecularly defined subunit vaccines, genetically engineered organisms or chimeras, vectored antigen formulations and naked DNA injections for immunisation of animals.",12.182214203553086,5.147489696320732

Moving forward, integration of systems biology technologies is required to comprehensively chart the antiviral landscape, combining findings from transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, epigenetic, and single cell analyses into predictive models of the antiviral response. The importance of systems integration was recently highlighted by the observation of notable discordance between transcript and protein levels in peptide-stimulated antigen specific CD8+ T cells (Hukelmann et al., 2015) . Despite the utility of systems biology approaches, a notable challenge has been the extraction of meaningful information from the extensive data sets that are generated. The implementation of current and novel computation methods are required to identify and prioritize lists of top candidate molecules and signaling pathways to help drive hypothesis generation. A critical next step is experimental testing and refinement of predictive models, a too often overlooked process referred to as biologic validation. Further application of systems biology approaches will allow for the dissection of antiviral responses within traditionally difficult to study cell populations, such as rare primary cells and human clinical samples, allowing for a much needed enhanced understanding of cell type specific antiviral responses. Finally, systems biology approaches have the potential to redefine the field of personalized medicine, allowing treatment and vaccination strategies to be designed with host genetics in mind (Hood and Tian, 2012) . In summary, the continued implementation of systems biology approaches will be essential for improving our understanding of viral pathogenesis and antiviral immunity, revealing novel targets for therapeutic and vaccination strategies.",13.783653074047752,4.242415623356527

Nonenhanced infection does not result in severe disease until after 12 days from exposure. Since the time of exposure to virus is almost always impossible to determine in field infections, it is likewise virtually impossible to determine with certainty whether or not a particular infection is enhanced or not. In one study of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in two high-risk cat populations in Switzerland (Fehr et al., 1995) , the authors state that the vaccine did not result in enhanced disease.

FIP is described briefly as an example of a group II and III virus immunopathology involving ADE. Feline coronaviruses exist in two forms, The first form, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), is a pathogen of minor significance, but a spontaneous mutation of this virus results in the second form, FIPV, which replicates in peritoneal macrophages, producing peritonitis and, occasionally, FIP, a fatal Arthus-like pyogranulomatous disease in kittens and cats, with ADE being incriminated as a disease-enhancing factor (56, 57, 80) . That antibodies are pathogenic is evidenced by observations that kittens who have acquired passive maternal FIPV antibodies develop a more rapid and fulminant disease following challenge with FIPV than do seronegative kittens (80) . Disease enhancement has been demonstrated in cats that were infected in the presence of vaccine-derived humoral immunity directed against the spike protein of FIPV (78) . Similarly, cats immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the spike protein of FIPV died earlier than control animals (78) . In adult cats, FIPV develops during chronic infections with feline coronaviruses after FECV mutates to FIPV, gaining macrophage tropism (79) . As antibody responses to FIPV are mounted, infection and disease severities are enhanced (56) . In summary, antibody responses to FIPV occurring during the course of infection, passive transfer of antibodies from natural infections, and immunization with killed or recombinant vaccines have all led to enhanced FIPV disease.

The phenomenon is somewhat against our intuition-ρ k should be same regardless of different k.

So the lower inclination ρ k comes from the lower chance of choice, but not from the lower willingness of vaccination. To higher chance to be infected, so they have fewer opportunities to decide whether to take vaccination or not. As one can predict: diseases can much more easily spread on networks with an increase of the average degree. However, under the voluntary vaccination mechanism, a higher level of disease leads to more vaccinated persons, so the discussed phenomenon above may change. In Fig. 5 we study the final number of infections versus average degree of networks for the two cases. As one can see from Fig. 5(a) , for the uniform case, the final number of infections increases with the average degree of network. However, for the preferential case, the final number of infections increases with average degree at first, and then the less favorable situation is controlled when the average degree is large (see Fig. 5(b) ). What causes such a distinct result? To answer this question, we reexamine Eqs. (7) and (9) . From Eq.

For example, due to the short validity of the influenza vaccine and not so serious consequences of regular human influenza, many individuals are reluctant to take vaccinations. However, for hepatitis B, even with the short validity of its vaccine, many people are still willing to take vaccination iteratively because of the high risk of hepatitis B. So, in the following we will investigate the effects of the validity of the vaccine on the spread of epidemics for the uniform case and the preferential case, respectively. To describe the variation of vaccine effectiveness among individuals, we assume that the vaccine validity period T v for each individual satisfies a normal distribution T v = N(50, 1.0). Namely, the mean value is 50 and the standard deviation is 1.0 (We also take T v in other forms, generally, the longer the period of validity is, the lower the level of infection is.) By comparing the uniform case with the preferential case, one can find that the number of infections and the number of vaccinations form more significant oscillations in the uniform case (see Fig. 7 ). Such a phenomenon is obvious: once the disease is prevalent, because of the imprecise information on the disease, most individuals choose to take vaccination en masse, the outbreak of the disease is controlled to a very low level, and individuals then relax their vigilance. However, the disease will break out again once the vaccine loses its effect on protecting individuals. Again, most individuals will take vaccination. In this way we observe strong oscillations with time (see Fig. 7(a) ). For the preferential case, because ''larger nodes'' are more diligent in taking vaccination, both the number of infections and the number of vaccinations show damped periodic oscillations and then reach a relative steady state, as shown in Fig. 7(b) .",12.238490970616803,7.762976031591339

Among several existing control measures, vaccination attracts the hugest attention from theoretical and experimental perspectives [273] [274] [275] [276] . During the seasons of disease spreading, the high risk of infection usually stimulates individual vaccination enthusiasm, while high expenses or side effects of a vaccine may lead to the opposite case. Thus, individuals face a dilemma: to vaccinate or not, both of which ways can be managed as two basic strategies with respective cost functions. To resolve this dilemma, game theory has been integrated into individual decisionmaking processes, where nodes hold the prevention strategy according to risk and expenses in the epidemic campaign [277] . In a recent research [278] , where nodes are only allowed to make rational selection (i.e. taking vaccination only if its expense is low), the Authors found that disease outbreak can be more effectively inhibited on SF networks than on random networks. Compared with early theoretical predictions of disease thresholds [239] , this interesting outcome indicates that voluntary vaccination can effectively control the spreading of diseases in real-world networks. Similarly, when the imitation dynamics with noise replaces the deterministic rule in the disease-behavior study, multiple effects spontaneously arise: for perfect vaccine, vaccination behavior of SF networks beats that of random networks, while imperfect vaccine enables the promotion of vaccination and eradication of disease to act better on homogeneous connectivity patterns [279] . In Ref. [280] it is found that the spatial population structure shows a ''double-edged sword'' effect, which fosters vaccine uptake at the low cost of vaccination, but causes vaccination to plummet when the cost goes beyond a certain threshold. More specifically, if a small fraction of individuals consistently holds vaccinating in flu-like diseases, these committed vaccinators can efficiently avoid the clustering of susceptible individuals and stimulate other imitators to take vaccination, thus contributing to the promotion of vaccine uptake [281] .",14.357104014367184,7.7131173201934615

It is the administration of vaccine to produce immunity to a disease. Vaccination involves the stimulation of the immune system to prepare it for the event of an invasion from a particular pathogen for which the immune system has been primed (Arntzen 1997 ) . On recognizing the foreign substance (live/ weakened microbes, antigen or proteins) which enters the body through vaccine, the immune system activates, producing antibodies to destroy the invader. Not only this but this attack leaves behind the 'memory' T and B cells which guards body in case of any future attack by that pathogen. Some vaccines provide lifelong protection; others (such as those for cholera and tetanus) must be re-administered periodically (Langridge 2006 ) . Classically, this has been achieved by presenting the immune system with whole viruses or bacteria that have been killed or made too weak to proliferate much. However, these conventional vaccines poses threat of actually acquiring the infection from weakened or attenuated pathogenic strains. Thus newer approach uses sub unit vaccines and recombinant vaccines. These vaccines consist of specifi c macromolecules that induce a protective immune response against a pathogen rather than administering the whole pathogen in the body. A ""subunit vaccine"" refers to a pathogen-derived protein (or even just an immunogenic domain of a protein, i.e. ""an epitope"") that cannot cause disease but can elicit a protective immune response against the pathogen. Very often the subunit-vaccine candidate is a recombinant protein made in transgenic production-hosts (such as cultured yeast cells), then purifi ed, and injected as vaccines to immunize against a specifi c disease (Mor and Arntzen 2002 ) . These sub-unit vaccines increases vaccine safety by circumventing the need to use live viruses or microbes and has thus made them the preferred approach for vaccine manufacturers (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 1998 ).",12.387230403078773,5.195617199836782

FIP is described briefly as an example of a group II and III virus immunopathology involving ADE. Feline coronaviruses exist in two forms, The first form, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), is a pathogen of minor significance, but a spontaneous mutation of this virus results in the second form, FIPV, which replicates in peritoneal macrophages, producing peritonitis and, occasionally, FIP, a fatal Arthus-like pyogranulomatous disease in kittens and cats, with ADE being incriminated as a disease-enhancing factor (56, 57, 80) . That antibodies are pathogenic is evidenced by observations that kittens who have acquired passive maternal FIPV antibodies develop a more rapid and fulminant disease following challenge with FIPV than do seronegative kittens (80) . Disease enhancement has been demonstrated in cats that were infected in the presence of vaccine-derived humoral immunity directed against the spike protein of FIPV (78) . Similarly, cats immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the spike protein of FIPV died earlier than control animals (78) . In adult cats, FIPV develops during chronic infections with feline coronaviruses after FECV mutates to FIPV, gaining macrophage tropism (79) . As antibody responses to FIPV are mounted, infection and disease severities are enhanced (56) . In summary, antibody responses to FIPV occurring during the course of infection, passive transfer of antibodies from natural infections, and immunization with killed or recombinant vaccines have all led to enhanced FIPV disease.

Smoking has also been identified as a risk for Legionella infection [329] . Smoking cessation should be attempted when smokers are hospitalized; this is particularly important and relevant when these patients are hospitalized for pneumonia. Materials for clinicians and patients to assist with smoking cessation are available online from the US Surgeon General (http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/tobacco), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov/ tobacco), and the American Cancer Society (http://www .cancer.org). The most successful approaches to quitting include some combination of nicotine replacement and/or bupropion, a method to change habits, and emotional support. Given the increased risk of pneumonia, the committee felt that persons unwilling to stop smoking should be given the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, although this is not currently an ACIPrecommended indication. 48 . Cases of pneumonia that are of public health concern should be reported immediately to the state or local health department.

Pooling of colostrum should be avoided unless it is to be pasteurized, because it increases risk for exposure to pathogens. In some situations it may be advantageous to avoid feeding colostrum from high-risk cows. For example, in herds infected with MAP, only colostrum from low-risk cows (test-negative, no clinical signs of disease) or pasteurized colostrum should be fed [149] . For the control of BLV, feeding of colostrum from seronegative cows in herds of low BLV prevalence, or freezing of all colostrum in higher prevalence herds is recommended; freezing kills leukocytes and therefore reduces the chance of BLV transmission [47] .

In addition to HIV, there is opportunity for developing new vaccines and immunization programs for diseases of the developed world and even the more challenging targets that are prevalent in underdeveloped countries, such as Ebola fever, dengue, and hookworm disease. Careful analysis of the disease patterns of the populace can also point out the need for new immunization programs using modifications of established vaccines. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has long been a prospective target for vaccine development. Developing a vaccine against RSV has been a challenge, because antibody is insufficient for protection and inactivated vaccines that generate a predominantly antibody response (Th2) can promote exaggerated disease. An early formalin-inactivated alum-precipitated vaccine enhanced disease, and temperature-sensitive live-attenuated intranasal vaccines were ineffective. Jonathan Klein-Evans (MedImmune Inc.) very effectively described several different approaches that have been taken towards an RSV vaccine. These include subunit vaccines with purified viral glycoproteins, a polypeptide vaccine, DNA vaccines expressing the F and G glycoproteins of the virus, and live virus vectors including vaccinia virus, bovine parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus which express the F and G glycoproteins (11) . Med-Immune Inc. developed a cold-passaged temperature-sensitive attenuated viral vaccine by passage of RSV at temperatures less than 32°C. This virus can establish upper respiratory infections but cannot replicate in the warmer environment of the lungs. Phase I/II trials of this vaccine have been promising. He stressed the importance of keeping the patent lawyers, like himself, involved in the vaccine development process to secure the company's investment in new technologies (12) .",12.812145142447818,7.671291379175736

In the absence of serotype-specific protective antibodies or in the presence of low levels or subneutralizing levels of virus specific antibody, other human viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and dengue virus demonstrate enhanced disease upon re-infection (Connors et al., 1992a,b; Halstead, 2003; Kakuk et al., 1993; Murphy et al., 1990; Sullivan, 2001) . Disease enhancement in cases of RSV occurs in the absence of protective titers of antibodies and is likely mediated by cellular immune responses that lead to immunopathology. Antibody dependent entry observed in dengue virus infections is similar to that which occurs in FIPV infection. In dengue virus infections, antibody enhanced entry occurs after previously infected individuals are re-infected with a second serotype of dengue virus. The antibodies to the first serotype of dengue virus are not protective against the second serotype, and virus entry into susceptible cells is facilitated through Fc-receptor-mediated mechanisms by these non-protective antibodies.",19.16007507223008,7.668622542742304

In general, these observations are consistent with other studies of SARS vaccines, in which vaccines that elicit a robust serum neutralizing antibody response in animal models provide protection from challenge with virus (7,11), though systemic antibodies may not confer sterilizing immunity in all models, and mucosal immunity may enhance the level of protection (8, 34) .

Due to the cross-sectional nature, it was not possible to ascertain the vaccination status of calves in the study with certainty, instead we relied on the in-person surveyreported vaccination protocols, although respondents were asked to answer the questions with respect to the current cohort of calves on their premises during the visit. If calves were older than the age of vaccination stated in the questionnaire they were considered vaccinated. However, the true vaccination status and time since vaccination may have been different for an unknown number of calves. No associations between reported vaccination status and BRD were found when calves at least 7 d older than age of vaccination were considered vaccinated to account for time to initiate an immune response. Our findings correlated with a randomized clinical trial by Windeyer et al. (2012) of 2,874 heifer calves on 19 commercials dairy farms in Minnesota and Ontario, in which they found no difference in risk of BRD between calves vaccinated at 2 or 5 wk of age or both with a commercial multivalent modified live vaccine against the common respiratory viruses compared with a placebo control group. Those authors cited interference by maternal antibodies, unresponsiveness of the neonatal immune system, timing of immunity relative to pathogen exposure, disease caused by pathogens other than the viruses in the vaccine, or herd immunity as possible explanations for their findings. The vaccination of dams may only be effective in preventing calfhood BRD in combination with adequate transfer of passive immunity. Many factors can affect the efficiency of transfer of passive immunity, from the amount, quality, and timing of colostrum fed to the storage time and temperature (Pithua et al., 2013 , Williams et al., 2014 , Lago et al., 2018 . It is possible that any positive effect of dam vaccination may have been diluted by other variables affecting transfer of passive immunity. In a longitudinal study following over 11,300 preweaned calves on 5 dairies in California and associating management factors to BRD in the calves, vaccinating dams with either a killed or a modified live vaccine reduced the risk of disease in calves. . The longitudinal study design combined with close follow-up of management practices by verifying changes every 1 to 4 mo in a few dairies may have been the reason that study found these associations, whereas in the present study they were not apparent. The complexity of factors involving vaccination of neonatal calves combined with the present study design make it difficult to extend recommendations based on our findings.",12.03481411003099,8.437194546779583

This new method involves the generation of a brief electric field in tissue around a local injection site that results in the transient poration, or permeabilization, of the cellular membranes. As a result, antigen-specific immune responses are greatly enhanced and are likely due to increased DNA uptake and antigen expression. Thus, electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination represents a promising new strategy for the elicitation of strong immune responses directed against the expressed antigen(s) and not the vector, and ongoing studies are currently underway to optimize the working parameters of this technique.

Method: Data on influenza vaccination were obtained from Saudi pilgrims who took part in a large trial during the Hajj of 2013, 2014 and 2015. Pilgrims were met and recruited in Mina, Makkah during the peak period of Hajj and were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire that recorded their influenza vaccination history, including reason(s) for non-receipt of vaccine. Results: A total of 6974 Saudi pilgrims aged between 18 and 95 (median 34) years were recruited; male to female ratio was 1:1.2.

This is illustrated in the Ross River and Murray Valley in Western Australia, where the risk of infection appears to shift with both natural climatic patterns and human-made environmental manipulations; and for which Mackenzie and colleagues describe a robust architecture of monitoring climate, animal, and vector populations, water sources, and other ecological factors determining human risk in order to prevent outbreaks. 6 The shift away from viewing the host and pathogen in isolation, to understanding the crucible in which they live, increases complexity and requires a more integrative scientific method that we now refer to as One Health. In this context, Machalaba and colleagues report on an interdisciplinary collaboration investigating how best to evaluate the economic value of investing in One Health approaches to better control and prevent zoonotic infections. On the same theme, Phelan and Gostin discuss how global-level legal strategies for tackling antimicrobial resistance, such as global regulations or a treaty, could strengthen multisectoral, multi-institutional collaboration on infectious disease, with important benefits for pandemic preparedness at the global level. 7 Canavan and colleagues point out that managing infectious disease risk in the food system, without considering other sectors, such as nutrition and sustainability, appears an ineffective and inefficient strategy for preventing infectious disease outbreaks; they argue for an integrated approach instead. 8 Recent pandemic threats such as Ebola and Zika viruses have spurred a global conversation around resilience in health systems and their ability to react and rebound when dangers arise. 9 The contributions to this special issue illustrate a One Health approach to the risk assessment of and response to infectious diseases, emphasizing connections among human health, animal health, and the environment. This strategy is essential to infectious disease resilience writ large, and resilience of health systems in particular. In addition to organizing systems for rapid detection and response, the broader One Health view urges us to rethink prevention. In particular, we should reject an economic paradigm exclusively focused on production or economic development at any cost, especially in areas such as agriculture, where emerging zoonotic disease risk is significant.",13.24786221282913,5.017308658525663

RSV disease is also a major health problem in adults and the elderly. Severe bronchiolitis is one of the major outcomes of RSV infection. Observation of enhanced disease among children receiving the formalininactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine in the 1960s (Kim et al. 1969) , as well as the frequent occurrence of severe disease among infants <6 months of age, when maternal antibodies are present, prompted investigations on ADE of RSV infections. Subsequently, enhancement of RSV infection by RSV-specific monoclonal antibodies and human immune sera was demonstrated in vitro in monocytic (U937, THP-1) and macrophage-like (P388D1) cell lines (Gimenez et al. 1989 (Gimenez et al. , 1996 Krilov et al. 1989; Osiowy et al. 1994) . The phenomenon has also been reported in Bonnet monkeys developing enhanced disease following FI-RSV immunization (Ponnuraj et al. 2001 (Ponnuraj et al. , 2003 . FcγR-mediated internalization of immune complexes is the suggested mechanism, with antibodies against the viral surface glycoproteins, the attachment glycoprotein (G) and fusion glycoprotein (F), playing an important role. Although epithelial cells of the respiratory tract are primary targets of RSV infection, it has been suggested that alveolar macrophages are infected through ADE, resulting in activation of Th2 response and increased expression of TNF-α, IL-6, thus causing enhanced disease (Gimenez et al., 1996) . Further, ADE-mediated infection of lung dendritic cells (DCs) has been demonstrated to negatively modulate DC cell function, resulting in impaired T-cell activation, and has been suggested to contribute to RSV pathogenesis (Gomez et al. 2016 ). However, the clinical effects of RSV-ADE still remain unclear with different studies reporting contradictory observations regarding the association of maternal antibody-induced ADE and disease severity in infants (Chanock et al. 1970; van Erp et al. 2017) .",15.90438277177307,9.242663168194916

Experimental infection of the cotton rat with HPIV-3 leads to infection of bronchiolar epithelial cells, bronchiolitis, and interstitial pneumonia, mimicking human disease and making it a relevant model for HPIV-3 lower respiratory infection [87] . The authors studied cotton rats infected with either wild-type HPIV-3 or variant viruses containing HN molecules with individual mutations that conferred high receptor-binding avidity or low neuraminidase (receptor-cleaving) activity [88] . The infected animals experienced normal clearance of the variant viruses as opposed to the wild-type viruses; however, each of the HN protein alterations led to striking differences in the ability of HPIV-3 to cause extensive disease in the cotton rat lung. The variants caused alveolitis and an interstitial infiltrate, whereas the wild-type virus only caused peribronchiolitis, and the enhanced disease caused by the HN variants was manifested by greatly increased inflammatory cell infiltrate in the alveoli and interstitial spaces in the lung. This finding suggested that the differences between variants were caused by modulation of the inflammatory response through the different HN protein activity of the variants, and are dissociated from viral replication or infectivity. The authors hypothesize that mutations in the HN protein that alter either its affinity for receptor or its receptor-cleaving activity may modify the nature of the inflammatory response of the host. By using HN variants to dissect the etiology of enhanced disease it may be possible to identify which component(s) of the immune system's response to HPIV3 contributes to disease. Experiments are underway to determine whether HPIV-3 HN protein alterations that enhance disease specifically alter chemokine expression.

The proverbial ''canary in a coal mine'', as later memorialized by Sting in a 1980 song, stems from the use of canaries to detect trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide in mines since the early 1900s. Their death indicated to miners that they needed to evacuate the mine to prevent asphyxiation. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was one of the first global acknowledgments of chemicals affecting nontarget animals. DDT was found to reduce the eggshell thickness of multiple bird species (Porter and Wiemeyer 1969) . It was later discovered that bioaccumulation of the chemical through the trophic levels had devastating effects on the populations of certain top predators and insectivorous birds (e.g., raptors such as peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) and bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) (Grier 1982) . These effects became widely distributed by Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring'' (Carson 1962) and wildlife and plants were increasingly recognized as important indicators of man-made environmental health threats. During the 1990s, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began using ecological risk assessment (in addition to human risk assessment) to evaluate the risk of agrochemicals or other manufactured chemicals, superfund sites, as well as air and water pollution (EPA 1998) . Ecological risk assessment depends on scientific assessment of the risk a chemical poses to a wide variety of plants and animals, including invertebrates, fish, birds, and small mammals (EPA 1998). While the system continues to be improved, risk assessments have been important in identifying the detrimental effect of acid rain (Beamish 1974), perfluorinated chemicals ( Van de Vijver et al. 2003) , and most recently endocrine disruptors (Kloas and Lutz 2006) .

However, this research has not much emphasized the quasispecies character of infl uenza virus evolution. Instead, it concentrates on the evolution of the master template or clades of template for the purposes of vaccine development ( Webster and Govorkova, 2006 ) . The views stemming from this type of evolution have lent themselves well to master template-based phylogenetic analysis and have dominated how many researchers think of virus-host evolution. Thus it is curious, given the above emphasis, that the quasispecies character of infl uenza populations often seems of low relevance to issues of acute disease and vaccination, other then to provide a source of diversity.

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been observed during FIP-CoV infection [7] and may be part of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection. Disease associated with SARS-CoV infection results from immune-mediated infiltration of the airways by lymphocytes and macrophages. Enhanced disease should be marked by increased viral titer after prior exposure to the virus or virus components. In the case of FIP, the virus gains entry into macrophage cells via neutralizing antibodies to the spike envelope protein, which bind the virus and are internalized by the cell. Macrophages have been shown to be virally infected in patients with SARS, and the concern is that these macrophages provide an additional host substrate in which the virus may grow. Furthermore, early and more robust seroconversion has been associated with more severe disease in patients with SARS, implicating SARS as an immune-mediated disease [25] . If SARS-CoV gains entry to macrophages through antibodies, then vaccines that elicit these responses may not be safe. We purposely designed a weak vaccine that elicited a mild antibody response to test the possibility that low antibody titers are associated with enhanced pulmonary disease as opposed to a strong antibody response, which should be completely protective. We did not see an increase in viral titer in vaccinated ferrets versus mock-vaccinated ferrets, and the vaccine did not induce ADE. This suggests that, under these conditions, an inactivated whole-virus vaccine can provide some measure of protection without the risk of enhanced lung or liver disease. Still needed are kinetic studies to show that infected ferrets are protected from further infection in a dose-dependent manner.

However, most of the evidence is taken from limited data from in vitro and animal experiments. The interpretation of these findings with regard to implications for human disease is not clear. Concerns over the safety of SARS vaccines came from a previous animal study in which ADE was observed in domestic cats after vaccination against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) (Vennema et al. 1990 ). Moreover, ferrets that are immunized with MVA vaccine expressing S protein suffer hepatitis whilst failing to develop protection (Weingartl et al. 2004 ). In addition, some variants of SARS-CoV are resistant to antibody neutralization, but the infection is enhanced by antibodies against a different variant (Yang et al. 2005b) . Under in vitro conditions, entry into human B-cell lines by SARS-CoV virus could be carried out in an FcgRII-dependent and ACE2-independent fashion, indicating that ADE of virus entry is an alternative cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV (Kam et al. 2007) . However, there is no direct evidence that patients with SARS have had previous exposure to a related virus. Likewise, there is no evidence of enhanced disease in the lungs of animals that are infected with SARS-CoV following passive transfer of antibodies against SARS-CoV induced by infection or immunization. Also, macrophages are not productively infected by SARS-CoV Bisht et al. 2004; Stadler et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2004b; Greenough et al. 2005; Kam et al. 2007 ). Hence, the potential for ADE following SARS vaccination is low. However, due to the lack of animal models that mimic the clinical disease in humans, care must be taken in the interpretation of the safety data of SARS vaccines.",13.82926550614687,7.253781842070304

Only high-risk groups, such as specific populations in equatorial Africa, would probably be targeted for vaccination as there is currently no demonstrated need for wider coverage. As MARV outbreaks have been both temporally and geographically sporadic, determining regions for prophylactic vaccination is extremely difficult. In EBOV endemic areas (i.e., eastern Gabon, western Republic of Congo, a large portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and part of Uganda) a widespread vaccination campaign could be considered. Including protection against MARV in these populations is not without merit as there is overlap between the viruses in these regions. As human MARV infections have been associated with visits to caves around Mount Elgon, near the Kenya/Sudan border, appropriate education and precautions should be considered at this time, rather than vaccination. International aid workers who work in endemic regions or respond to disease outbreaks in equatorial Africa would also benefit from prophylactic vaccination. The other priority population would be laboratory workers who handle these agents. Additional populations that may benefit from prophylactic vaccination would include first responders, front-line hospital staff and military personnel. While a prophylactic vaccine is desirable, the logistics of ensuring good vaccine coverage in equatorial Africa are difficult. This makes a rapid-acting and/or postexposure vaccine desirable as it would have the potential to decrease the case-fatality rates and prevent further spread of disease during an outbreak.

For this reason decisions surrounding what should be done about new or pressing zoonotic risks are often contested, and finding the right balance between over-caution, laissez-faire approaches, and determining the weight given to different socioeconomic factors can be difficult. For example a lack of due diligence can expose the population to the risk of infection for far longer than necessary, as was the case with BSE. Conversely, the overzealous application of the precautionary principle can destroy the livelihood of a population, impact its food supply, limit development, and entrench or exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantage (World Health Organization, 2004) . Furthermore, when the zoonotic risk is new, attempts to explain the choice of policy are likely to be further complicated by uncertainty regarding the precise risk of infection, the drivers of disease emergence, and the measures needed to control the risk of infection.

Inactivated vaccine candidates against HMPV have not yet been successfully tested in animal models with most of them leading to enhanced disease severity upon subsequent natural infection. On the other hand, vaccination with subunit vaccine composed either of purified HMPV fusion protein or the fusion protein expressed via different viral or bacterial vectors viz. retroviral vector, alphavirus vector, rBCG etc. could induce protective immunity against both homologous as well as heterologous strains of the virus, though for a short duration. Fusion protein based VLPs in combination with certain adjuvants like TiterMax Gold are also highly immunogenic and protective against the virus. Though the inactivated or subunit vaccines are safe but the requirement of booster doses and lack of strong cellular immune response poses a limitation on its use. The live attenuated viruses overcome this limitation. Recombinant approach to develop live attenuated viral vaccine candidate through reverse genetics technique can be considered as one of the best approach, provided a good level of attenuation is attained and immunogenicity is maintained.

As vaccination coverage increases over a population, the proportion of immunized individuals finally exceeds a critical level above which the disease can no longer persist; this point is called herd immunity, as mentioned above. Once herd immunity is attained, the remaining unvaccinated individuals are quite unlikely to become infected since they are indirectly protected by vaccinated individuals. Thus, unvaccinated individuals obtain benefits from the herd immunity without considering the perceived risks associated with vaccination, such as complications, side effects, and financial costs. There is less incentive for them to get vaccinated, and Fig. 4 .2 Scheme of the social dilemma working behind the vaccination dilemma then, the so-called first-order free-rider problem 3 arises. Some reports suggest that the welfare of a society can be threatened if too many individuals perceive the herd immunity as a public good. 4 As a result, too much self-interest destabilizes the herdimmunity state, and the disease resurges. This paradox makes complete eradication of the disease difficult under a voluntary vaccination policy, and causes a conflict between the optimal vaccination behavior for each individual and the sufficient level of vaccination needed to protect the whole society via the herd immunity. 5 In addition, the number of vaccinated individuals may be reduced by underestimates of infection risk due to lack of knowledge about the disease and/or by overestimation of vaccine risk based on scientifically groundless information. 6 Interrelations among vaccination coverage, disease prevalence, and the vaccination behaviors of individuals are complicated, and we should duplicate and dynamically as well as quantitatively predict the consequences of these interrelations if we intend to develop effective public-health measures for preventing epidemics of infectious diseases. In this regard, many studies of the vaccination dilemma have applied a game-theoretic framework to a population wherein each individual tries to maximize his or her own payoff. These studies have provided highly fruitful results. 7 Let us call this framework the ""vaccination game"", where both the epidemiological dynamics and the dynamics of the human decision-making process are simultaneously and interdependently considered.",13.583560884090241,6.437905564936193

Habitat changes that lead to alterations in population structure or migratory patterns, for example, are likely to affect the risk of zoonotic disease transmission (Dobson and May, 1986) . The effect of habitat fragmentation on disease processes has rarely been investigated, but it has recently been shown that Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates are higher in fragmented than continuous Atlantic forest (Vaz et al., 2007) ; and the risk of Lyme disease in New York is also apparently increased by fragmentation (Allan et al., 2003) . Interestingly, the division of endangered Ethiopian wolf population into small sub-populations, joined by habitat corridors, has been shown to allow rabies control to be achieved using a low-coverage vaccination strategy (Haydon et al., 2004) . The strategy operates by eliminating the largest outbreaks of disease, and so enhances meta-population persistence, rather than by the conventional objective of reducing the reproductive number of the disease to less than one (Haydon et al., 2004) . Human activities that artificially increase, rather than decrease, animal densities also influence disease processes. These increases can be the result of losses of absolute habitat area, or from the provision of supplementary food or water. In the United States, the practice of supplementary feeding of house finches and white-tailed deer has lead to an increase in the incidence of mycoplasmal diseases and bTB, respectively (Hartup et al., 1998; Schmitt et al., 1997) , presumably because of greater opportunities for disease transmission, and possibly also immunosuppressive effects of aggression at the feeding sites. bTB has also been an intractable problem in the British cattle herd, with the incidence rising inexorably since 1979. With a cull of badgers recently being ruled out, somewhat controversially, as offering no meaningful contribution to the long-term control of the disease (Donnelly et al., 2005) , it is worth asking whether consideration of the ecology of the badgers and cattle might help generate workable solutions. Over the past 30 years, along with the increase of bTB, there has also been an increase in badger densities, and it is likely that this contributes at least in part to the disease in cattle. So why have badger populations risen? Might the answer lie in changes in land use? Macdonald and Newman (2006) speculate on a possible role for climate change, with milder winters and hence greater earthworm availability improving survival rates.",13.917287714017139,5.874192737893708

Recent advances towards defining RSV (F)specific neutralization-sensitive epitopes and solving the structure of the prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations of the trimer of F glycoprotein (McLellan et al., 2013) have led to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neutralization, serological responses to natural RSV infection and vaccination, pathogenesis of disease, and mechanisms of viral inactivation (Liang et al., 2015) . Elucidating the structure and function of F glycoprotein has led to the design of a vaccine antigen that recapitulates the surface of the functional pre-F molecule. Stabilizing the pre-F through mutagenesis has further improved its immunogenicity. In a primary infection in infants, there is more antibody against the post-F, which have poor neutralizing ability. In contrast, most antibodies in adults recognize the pre-F form. Clinical trials of a pre-F RSV vaccine started in February 2017.",13.82638201848101,5.005388761633644

For profitable animal husbandry practices, prevention and control of diseases should be considered on cost-benefit ratio basis. The colossal losses are incurred during disease outbreaks like FMD, IBR, PPR, bluetongue, sheep pox, goat pox in livestock and IBD, MD, IB, EDS, CIA and avian influenza in poultry. Vaccines and judicial vaccination procedures are only ways to prevent and control such diseases in a cost-effective manner. The concept of vaccination was first popularized by Edward Jenner in 1798 as a method to fight against the deadly human small pox disease. However, prior to it, Chinese people were practicing a form of vaccination called 'ovination' where virulent sheep pox virus was inoculated in sheep to generate immunity against further infection with sheep pox virus. Similarly, in FMD, in the absence of a vaccine, 'apthization' (deliberately rubbing the infected fluid or lesions of diseased animals into the healthy animals of the farm/herd) was practiced with the objective of reducing the time, labour and cost towards the management of the outbreak in one go at the farm. The ILT virus, a herpes virus which causes respiratory disease in poultry, was recommended to be inoculated in the cloacal region to impart immunity in want of vaccine availability. However, now with the availability of dependable vaccines against most of the infectious diseases it is not advisable to use such methods as it has the risk of spreading the virulent virus to susceptible animals. After the successful initial approaches by Jenner using cow pox virus as vaccine against small pox in human, the concept of killed vaccine was made into use by Louis Pasteur in 1885 to prevent post-bite rabies disease in man. The mid-1940s designated as 'the era of cell culture' made a revolution in vaccine research to develop more attenuated live organisms as vaccine. Vaccine research has moved from the application of whole organism approach (inactivated or live attenuated) to synthetic antigenic peptide-based or gene-based vaccine approaches for man and animals against a number of infectious diseases.",12.7396496382942,8.398586798375504

The OIE Code defines risk communication as ""the interactive transmission and exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risk, riskrelated factors and risk perceptions among risk assessors, risk managers, risk communicators, the general public and other interested parties"". 175 For the OIE risk analysis to be useful, there has to be a consideration of who the policy relevant risk communicators are for a given risk problem in a given context. There is need to also think about how risk is communicated to, and by, different policy stakeholders, including the public, the media, farmers, medics, veterinarians, decision-makers across different sectors and even the donor community. Equally important is that in the process of risk communication, a context appropriate forum is used, allowing for as much dialogue and feedback in the risk analysis process as possible. Such a risk analysis process would derive most benefit if presented both on a forum capable of reaching the largest number of policy relevant stakeholders and in ways that engages the interests of each policy relevant stakeholder.

However, there is little, if any, association between PBC and MHC class I or class II alleles [14, 15] . Recently our group evaluated the concordance of PBC in a genetically defined population of twin sets [16] . We identified 16 pairs of twins within a 1400-family cohort including 8 sets each of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. In 5 of 8 sets (0.63 concordance) of the monozygotic twins, both individuals had PBC. Among the 8 pairs of the dizygotic twins, none were found to be concordant for PBC. Interestingly, the age at onset of disease was similar in 4 of 5 concordant sets of monozygotic pairs. However, while the concordance rate of PBC in identical twins is among the highest reported for any autoimmune disease, discordant pairs were also identified suggesting that factors other than genetic predisposition contribute to the development of PBC. Epidemiological studies suggest that environmental factors play a role in triggering or exacerbating PBC [17] [18] [19] . We conducted a large scale epidemiological study to evaluate risk factors and co-morbidities in PBC that involved a controlled interview-based study of 1032 patients and a similar number of controls matched for sex, age, race, and geographical location [20] . Data from this study indicate that having a first-degree relative with PBC, history of urinary tract infections, past smoking, or use of hormone replacement increased the risk of PBC. Frequent use of nail polish slightly increased the risk of having PBC. Another study examined the prevalence of PBC and PSC near superfund sites and reported significant clusters of PBC surrounding toxic sites [21] .",15.012089602911564,7.065053806173237

Although a high serum neutralizing Ab titer is able to prevent ALRI due to RSV in adults, it is more difficult to induce high Ab levels in neonates. Even if an adjuvant could induce high Ab responses in neonates, there is still the issue of vaccine-enhanced disease. Data from rodent models suggest that vaccine-enhanced disease is associated with priming of an excessive Th2 response, a factor exacerbated by the Th2 adjuvant, alum [100, 101] .

Thus, the conclusions only hold under the assumption that a future influenza strain will be 'similarly' infectious. Nonetheless, it is important to have demonstrated that even for the worst influenza pandemic in recent history, R 0 was probably not large relative to other diseases. Stegeman et al. (2004) quantified between-flock transmission characteristics of highpathogenicity avian influenza, a virus in the Netherlands that led to the culling of 30 million birds in 2003. R 0 was calculated as the product of the infectious period at flock level and the transmission rate at flock level; however, neither parameter was measured directly. Instead, the infectious period was estimated as the period between the moment of detection and the moment of culling, plus 4 days.

Epidemiological studies observe patterns of disease in conjunction with environmental exposure and provide inferences rooted in observed health outcomes, and for this reason are highly valuable for assessing health risks. The findings of several epidemiological studies have supported a relationship between stormwater exposure and waterborne illness for stormwater-impacted waterbodies (Haile et al., 1999; Colford Jr et al., 2007; Soller et al., 2017) . However, due to the study sizes and expense required to achieve predictive power in epidemiological studies and difficulty attributing risks to a particular exposure source and/or pathway, often QMRA approaches are used to assess risks where effect sizes are projected to be small due to low environmental concentrations. QMRA uses a process of hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose response analysis, and risk characterization to predict the risk of an infection or disease-related outcome based on an exposure to environmental media (Haas et al., 2014) . To the author's knowledge, there has not been an epidemiological study for potable or non-potable uses of stormwater resources. However, studies by Ashbolt and Bruno (2003) and Soller et al.

Face-to-face risk communication can entail holding a single public hearing during an environmental permitting process or conducting a series of intense, deliberative workshops with targeted audiences. Massmediated risk communication can involve scientists or government agencies issuing press statements, holding press conferences or giving interviews. Just as the specific avenues of risk communication vary, so too do the reasons behind them. Some efforts are used primarily to inform and educate, others actively seek public input, and still others seek consensus. The main concern here is matching objectives with methods and ensuring that participants understand their part in the overall process. A final consideration relates to the degree of control over the message. Senders of risk communication information have much less control over the ultimate messages when they rely on news media to propagate them, although the potential reach is much greater. By contrast, control is much greater in face-to-face settings or other direct forms of communication. Table 1 provides an overview of some common methods of risk communication and lists some advantages and disadvantages of each. With these considerations in mind, the next section examines four approaches towards providing risk information: persuasive, balanced, dialectical and narrative. F irst, conventional risk communication efforts that are used to educate lay audiences resemble persuasive models. Typically these models are one-sided approaches that try to convince audiences to change their attitudes or behaviours about a particular issue or set of issues in a particular direction (Krimsky & Plough, 1988) . Because of their explicit intent to change people's attitudes and behaviours, persuasive approaches are sometimes also referred to as advocacy approaches. Just as countless studies have examined the factors mitigating the impact of persuasive messages, numerous studies have also shown that conventional approaches to risk communication need to account for psychological factors (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Slovic, 2000; Weinstein, 1989 ), sociological influences (Kasperson, 1992 Freudenberg, 1993) and cultural determinants (Douglas, 1985) .",13.143675283873074,5.300461251735089

Various studies describe pathogens as the cause of these problems such as Rotavirus, Coronavirus, BVDV and Cryptosporidium (Hoet et al., 2003; Bendali et al., 1999) , but lack to describe management factors on which the farmer can intervene. There have been studies that described factors associated to either diarrhoea, respiratory syndromes or both. These factors include colostrum intake (Lorenz, 2006; Perez et al., 1990) , BVDV (Pardon et al., 2013 and Pardon et al., 2012) , weight at arrival in the veal herd (Brscic et al., 2012) , housing (Brscic et al., 2012; Lorenz, 2006) and type and amount of feed (Brscic et al., 2012) .

Furthermore, socioeconomic aspects are important, as developed countries have a greater capacity to provide appropriate treatment smoothly. Therefore, the labor intensity of an industry and the geographical and socioeconomic aspects should be taken into account to identify regions where the risk of dengue virus infection is high.

There is a gradual recovery of immune function in which the individual can become partially responsive prior to the acquisition of full immunoconlpetence. The precise point or points in the immune system of the offspring at which maternally-derived factors interfere is not defined. Some authors have described generalized cellular responsiveness (Clover & Zarkower, 1980) , and others describe antigen-specific reduction in both primary and secondary antibody responses (Husband & Lascelles, 1975) . However, it appears that individual lymphocyte subsets may be more or less susceptible to the effects of MDA. Wittman and Ohlinger (1987) found that MDA titres which interfered with the cytolytic T lymphocyte response to Aujeszky's disease vaccination in piglets did not prevent the sensitization of lymphocytes for antibody production. Interestingly, it has also been shown that high titres of MDA in piglets suppressed the generation of 'memory cells' following vaccination against Aujeszky's disease (Kuiper et al., 1984) whereas lower MDA titres that still suppressed the formation of antibody permitted the generation of immunological memory, which was apparent from the production of a secondary-type antibody response upon subsequent virus challenge (van Oirschot & de Leeuw, 1985) . It is also possible that anatomical compartments within the immune system are affected variously by MDA, as has been shown to be the case for the mucosal immune response to respiratory syncytial virus vaccination in calves (Kimman et al., 1989) . This study showed that a protec-tive mucosal antibody response could be effectively primed by the local application of attenuated virus in the face of MDA titres that inhibited all primal-y antibody responses and the generation of systemic antibody memo W. Thus, by taking advantage of these observed qualitative and quantitative variations in the degree of immunosuppression induced by MDA, it may be possible to design vaccination su'ategies that offer better protection against infectious diseases of young livestock.",12.834992817764242,5.689887267454132

In the 1960s, an attempt to vaccinate children with a formalininactivated HRSV vaccine failed when enhanced disease was reported after subsequent HRSV infection of vaccinated infants. 3, 4 A vaccine against HRSV is not currently available and a major obstacle for development of a vaccine is that the immunological mechanisms leading to either protection or enhanced disease has not been clarified. It seems that part of the illness caused by natural HRSV infection is because of the host immune response. 5, 6 For some years RSV serum antibodies were thought to play a role in the enhanced disease, 7 but passive antibody prophylaxis has shown that antibodies cause an acceleration of virus clearance without harmful effects 8, 9 although there was no improvement in the pulmonary pathology either. 10 A systemic cell-mediated sensitization has also been suggested to contribute to the altered response to natural HRSV infection that occurred after use of inactivated HRSV vaccine. 11 In this context the mouse model has been used intensively to study the association between T-cell subpopulations and immunemediated disease. 12 However, most of this work has focused on the vaccine-enhanced disease whereas there is a lack of investigation into the pathogenesis of the primary infection.

Emergency vaccination planning presents challenges, including how to predict resource needs, expand vaccine availability during global shortages, and address regulatory barriers to deliver new products. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports countries to plan, implement, and evaluate emergency vaccination response. We describe work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in collaboration with global partners to support emergency vaccination against cholera, typhoid, yellow fever, and Ebola, diseases for which a new vaccine or vaccine formulation has played a major role in response. Lessons learned will help countries prepare for future emergencies. Integration of vaccination with emergency response augments global health security through reducing disease burden, saving lives, and preventing spread across international borders. I n emergency settings, countries must be prepared to respond to public health threats. Prompt vaccine delivery can be a major component of emergency response, especially for populations vulnerable to epidemic-prone, vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Public health emergencies might be triggered by natural disaster; humanitarian emergency; a disease pandemic leading to health systems breakdown, as in the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014; or by a specific VPD outbreak not contained by ongoing immunization services. During emergencies affecting health systems in general, vaccination services are frequently disrupted.

Among them, Bauch and Earn [34] seminally utilized the game theory to model the dilemmatic situation for an individual facing with the epidemics, and they proposed a class of vaccination game to denote the individual decision making and found that, for the well-mixed population, the Nash equilibrium is never to vaccinate if the vaccination cost is higher than that of being infected; but there exists a Nash equilibrium yielding a suboptimal vaccinated fraction if the vaccine cost is lower than that of being infected.",13.07018511997315,6.609845925642336

Sometimes it is fairly well established that an infectious agent can at least be one of the causes of the disease, but in most instances it is no more than a hypothesis, with little or no good evidence. For conditions as common and as serious as multiple sclerosis, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, it would be of immense importance if a microorganism were incriminated, since this would give the opportunity to prevent the disease by vaccination or treat it with anti-microbials. For example, Borna disease (BD) has classically been described as a chronic, progressive meningoencephalomyelitis, causing both neurological and behavioural symptoms in horses and sheep. Experimental infection of tree shrews (Tupaia glis) with BD virus however results in very little overt disease, but afterwards the male is no longer able to enact the ritual courtship behaviour, which (as students well know) is an essential preliminary to mating in all primates. Thus it can be said that infection with BD virus renders the male psychologically sterile. Presumably the virus in some way alters the functioning of neurons concerned in this particular pathway. All other behavioural and physiological aspects appear normal. BD virus is not known to occur in man, but speculation about an analogous human situation is fuelled by the finding of BD virus-specific antibodies in patients with psychiatric/behavioural disorders. Since the aetiology of such diseases raises interesting problems in pathogenesis, the present state of affairs is summarised in Table 8 .1, which includes some of the human diseases whose infectious origin is probable, possible, conceivable or inconceivable.",12.998482721067173,10.110289353088383

Conventionally, the identification of immunodominant Mtb antigens for the generation of a repertoire of Mtb-specific T cells was thought to be the foundation for T cell-mediated protective immunity and, hence, an effective vaccine-based strategy against TB. However, despite inducing enhanced Tcell-mediated responses, one such vaccine has failed to improve protection in a human trial (Tameris et al. 2013) . After more than half a century of BCG vaccination, we still do not know the precise way in which BCG provides protection in children and to what extent this protection is mediated via CD4 + T cells. An emerging hypothesis is that BCG protection is mainly mediated through innate immune pathways, as reviewed elsewhere (Blankley et al. 2014 ). In addition, the finding that Mtb genes involved in the production of immunodominant CD4 + T cell antigens are hyper-conserved suggests that Mtb may paradoxically benefit from antigenspecific CD4 + T cell activation in humans (Comas et al. 2010) . This theory derives further indirect support from the HIV-TB syndemic: whereas HIV is clearly a risk factor for individual progression from Mtb infection to disease, HIV/ AIDS is negatively associated with contagion (Corbett et al. 2006) . Furthermore, the risk of active TB is enhanced during the early stage of HIV infection, when the number of CD4 + T cells is still in the normal range (Sonnenberg et al. 2005) .

THE AVIAN HOST A. Comparison of Class Aves with Other Vertebrates,"The avipoxviruses are widely distributed throughout the class Aves, having been isolated from some 60 species representing 20 avian taxonomic families. The avipoxviruses are responsible for economically important disease problems in commercial poultry and aviaries (Tripathy, 1993) . They may cause a slowly developing cutaneous disease with low mortality or, conversely, significant mortality, and generalized infections when in the diphtheritic form on mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract and associated areas. These large DNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell, where they form characteristic inclusion bodies within rapidly proliferating nodular lesions. The poxviruses may be transmitted by mechanical means such as introduction from poultry workers into abrasions in the skin of uninfected poultry. There is also real evidence for transmission of the disease by mosquitos and other vectors such as mites in close conditions, where the number of diseased birds is high. The avipoxviruses can also apparently establish a latent state and be naturally or chemically induced to reactivate (Kirmse, 1967b) . Cutaneous lesions containing infectious virus persistent for more than a year have also been documented in wild birds (Kirmse, 1967a) . Variant strains of avipoxviruses have since been isolated from previously vaccinated flocks that were experiencing significant mortality from the diphtheritic form of the disease (Tripathy and Reed, 1997) . This suggests that, similar to Marek's disease, vaccination against poxviruses may ultimately lead to escape of more virulent forms of the viruses. The avipoxviruses are also considered one of the most promising DNA virus vectors for delivery of recombinant poultry vaccines, and poxvirus-vectored vaccines against Newcastle disease and avian influenza have been licensed.",12.00067809696575,7.401986777945885

Animals that seroincreased for one or more viruses from induction to second blood sampling were at increased risk (OR: 1.4-2.1) of BRD compared to animals that did not seroincrease for any viruses. Collectively these results confirm that prior exposure to these viruses is protective while exposure at or after feedlot entry increases the risk of development of BRD in feedlots. However, the modest increases in risk associated with seroincrease for each virus separately, and the progressive increases in risk with multiple viral exposures highlights the importance of concurrent infections in the aetiology of the BRD complex.

These diseases have become more prominent in the wake of policies to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal production. This has led to more research focused on better understanding the immune system and its responses to pathogen challenge, and thus developing informed strategies to exploit immune responses that can support enhanced disease resistance and growth performance. Some chicken breeds and lines show greater resistance or susceptibility to various diseases, and thus these birds maybe able to shed light on immune processes or pathways that contribute to the more resistant/susceptible state. This review attempts to identify potentially important genes that show some consistency in (relative) up or downregulation in key tissues between the resistant and susceptible chickens. For coccidiosis and NE, relative downregulation of IL-10 and (slightly less consistently) upregulation of IFNγ appear to be features of more resistant birds. Data for IFN-α, IL-12, and IL-17D are currently less consistent. Gene expression data from NE studies have identified some potentially interesting, perhaps less well understood, immune-related genes (e.g., TCF12, BCL2, IRF2, TRAF3, TAB3, etc.,) that maybe associated with the resistant and/or susceptible phenotype. Salmonella and Campylobacter are important foodborne pathogens harbored by the chicken intestinal tract, while infectious bursal disease and infectious bronchitis are also important viral diseases of poultry. We, therefore, consider whether there are consistent features from resistant/susceptible disease models with these pathogens that relate to findings from the coccidiosis and NE studies. It is not anticipated that ideal immune responses to these pathogens will be identical but rather that consistent elements maybe identified that could help inform breeding or alternative strategies to support general disease resistance and enhanced (and efficient) flock productivity.",12.336318238631856,6.882893032252381

However, these types of null genetic mutation are rarely observed in nature, making it difficult to directly translate these finding into human disease models. For validation to have a translational impact on human disease, our studies must use genetic diversity to alter target gene/pathways functions rather than knockout or knockdown studies. The CC allows this type of analysis through generation of customizable recombinant inbred intercrosses (76, 77) . For example, studies with SARS-CoV have identified Serpine1, a key component of the urokinase pathway and an important player in tissue damage/repair following infection. Serpine1 deficiency results in enhanced disease and pathogenesis following SARS-CoV infection, likely due to increased lung pathology (Gralinski et al., manuscript submitted). However, the impact of these data are unclear in regards to human disease: the vast majority of people maintain functional Serpine1, but genetic diversity in this gene or region of the genome may have a significant impact on pathogenic outcomes and disease severity. To assay this possibility, we can utilize the CC to generate mouse lines with allelic diversity in this region of the genome, while maintaining genetic identity throughout the rest of the genome (Fig. 5A) . Similarly, the genome region could remain static and the background shifted to assess the impact of a specific allele. For Serpine1 in the CC, this means the possibility of examining the impact of 6 haplotypes during in vivo infection (Fig. 5B) . Importantly, other analysis can be layered onto the CC RIX experimental model including predictions based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) consequences (Fig. 5C) , structural alterations (78) (Fig. 5D) , and/or epigenetic regulatory factors. In addition, multiple genes could be analyzed in parallel to assay their allelic impact on each other; while either holding constant or randomizing the majority of the genome, allelic variants can be shuffled between the two gene regions, creating combinations to assay their interaction with each other and the global response (Fig. 5A) . For example, systems vaccinology has identified important genes impacting the antibody response (TNFRS17 & CaMKIV) and T-cell response (EIF2AK4 & C1QB) following yellow fever and influenza vaccination (15) . Using the CC, the varying allele combinations could be examined in the same background and provide a window into the interactions of different gene combinations and pathways.",13.069568844300571,6.817876436394178

Although ring vaccination was successful in containing smallpox in the setting of herd immunity, mathematical models predict that this strategy may not initially contain large or multifocal epidemics (Kaplan et al., 2002) . Furthermore, there is disagreement regarding the predicted benefit of postrelease mass vaccination, due to the lack of herd immunity, a highly mobile population, a relatively long incubation, and difficulties implementing quarantine and mass vaccination promptly (Mack, 2003; Mortimer, 2003) .

Public health practices to prevent MERS-CoV and its related complications could be suggested to emulate those proposed previously for seasonal influenza. During the 1957-58 pandemic and in response to substantial morbidity and mortality, the US Surgeon General recommended annual influenza vaccination for individuals with chronic debilitating disease, people aged !65 years, and pregnant women. 31 For these high-risk groups, the first recommendation for national universal seasonal influenza vaccination was established in 2010 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 32 A recent systematic review demonstrated that influenza vaccination can prevent all-cause hospitalization in infected subjects. 33 For example, in diabetic patients and people aged !65 years, vaccination prevented all-cause hospitalization with a vaccine effectiveness of 58% and 45%, respectively. 33 Furthermore, a significant protective effect of influenza vaccine was noted on intensive care unit admission (vaccine effectiveness of 81%), allcause mortality (32%), cardiac death (16%), and hospitalization due to pneumonia (14%). 34 However, given the quality of the body of evidence, it was proposed that these observations should be considered with caution. 33, 34 Indeed, despite numerous recommendations from public health organizations across the world (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), WHO, etc.) to administer respiratory disease vaccines annually (e.g., influenza), the vaccination rates in subjects with chronic diseases remains low.

By conferring individual and herd immunity, and by obviating the mayhem of implementing postrelease vaccine and quarantine programs, such a program possesses distinct advantages over other response plans. However, such an approach is currently hampered not only by the unknown risk of a smallpox release, but also by vaccine supply, safety, and logistics issues (Fauci, 2002; Amorosa and Isaacs, 2003) . The increasing number of persons at risk for severe vaccine reactions due to compromised immunity or dermatologic conditions (such as eczema) raises concern about the safety of a pre-exposure vaccination program in the era of epidemic HIV, organ transplantation, and immunosuppressive therapy (Bozzette et al., 2003; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003b; Grabenstein and Winkenwerder, 2003; Kemper et al., 2002) . In addition, the incidence of rare but severe smallpox vaccine complications in otherwise healthy recipients could result in a number of deaths and cases of severe disease that would be unacceptable were the risk of a smallpox release low. Risk analysis favors prerelease mass vaccination of the general population only if the probability of a large-scale or multifocal attack is high. However, prerelease mass vaccination of health care workers is favored at lower probabilities of attack, because of an increased probability of exposure while caring for patients, and the value of keeping health care workers healthy and functioning in the setting of an epidemic (Bozzette et al., 2003) .",12.77288237489611,5.373000651072189

A description of these factors is beyond the scope of the present report however, the details have been reviewed recently [16e18], and include (i) skewing of the immune response to favor Th2-type cytokines and an allergic response upon exposure to virus, (ii) dysregulation of the cytokine response with heightened Th2-and Th1-type responses that upon exposure to RSV resulted in a ""cytokine storm"", (iii) failure to induce adequate neutralizing antibody responses due to modification of critical epitopes on the fusion (F) glycoprotein following formaldehyde inactivation, (iv) low antibody avidity following immunization with FI-RSV vaccine that increases tissue damage in the small airways due to deposition of complement on cells decorated with anti-RSV-IgG immune complexes, (v) modulation of type 1 interferon responses as a result of binding of the RSV fusion glycoprotein (RSV-F) to toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), and (vi) contributions of host factors that enhance susceptibility to severe disease, such as genetic polymorphisms in TLR4 that have been detected with higher frequency among infants with severe RSV infection and disease as compared with controls who had only mild disease.",12.615605173146184,6.5602527222756635

Typically, this evaluation includes pre-clinical testing, and Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical studies. Sometimes additional postmarketing studies, also known as Phase 4, are required subsequent to licensure. Pre-clinical studies may include proof-ofconcept studies in animals to demonstrate immunogenicity and evidence of efficacy following a live virus challenge; for influenza and RSV vaccines these studies are typically performed in small animals such as mice, cotton rats, and/or ferrets (see Table 1 for summary). For RSV vaccines, animals should ideally be challenged with viruses that represent both subtype A and B viruses since it is expected that an effective vaccine will need to provide immunity against both subtypes. The need for an adjuvant to enhance or modify the immune response can also be justified using these preclinical tests. Repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats or rabbits may be needed as well as reproductive toxicology studies (if the vaccine is intended for use in a maternal immunization program). Pre-clinical testing of influenza and RSV vaccines in animal models also includes studies to demonstrate the attenuated phenotype and stability of live virus vaccines. For non-replicating RSV vaccines, additional testing in animals is required in order to provide evidence that the vaccine is unlikely to prime for enhanced susceptibility when vaccines are subsequently exposed to wild-type RSV infection post-vaccination.

Using ABMs, it is possible to go a step further and include more detail about the strategy for vaccination and the likely uptake in different individuals. One current application of such modelling is a Dengue vaccine that has recently been licenced for use in six countries. The clinical trials of the vaccine demonstrated its ability to success-fully confer immunity to those who had already been infected by Dengue; however, for people with no prior exposure to Dengue the vaccine increases risk of a more severe Dengue infection in future.

The geographic and socio-economic conditions intrinsic to the LASV endemic regions would pose significant difficulties for individuals at risk to have ready access to medical care, including antiviral drugs, to be treated against symptoms of LASV induced disease. Therefore, vaccination of the population at risk would be likely to provide a more effective strategy. However, a vaccination approach against LF similar to the one used against AHF is currently unfeasible because an attenuated strain for LASV has not been established. Nevertheless, a variety of approaches have been pursued aimed at the development of a LASV vaccine including DNA immunization approaches (Rodriguez-Carreno et al., 2005) and different vector-based vaccines. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing LASV NP or GP have been shown to provide cellmediated immunity against LASV in guinea pigs and non-human primates (Fisher-Hoch et al., 2000) . However, this approach would face the problem of the risk of using a vaccinia virus based vector in a population with high HIV prevalence. Alphavirus-based vectors have been used to induce protective immunity against LASV in guinea pigs (Pushko et al., 2001) , and more recently a recombinant VSV where LASV GP substituted for the VSV G was shown to provide protection against a lethal challenge with LASV (Geisbert et al., 2005) . Likewise, the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Lee et al., 2005) , and the 17D Yellow fever vaccine (Bredenbeek et al., 2006) have shown promising results. Whether these recombinant vaccines provide long-term protection remains to be determined, an issue highly relevant in the case of LF due to a cumulative lifetime risk of exposure to LF vaccine within the West Africa human population. The induction of heterologous immunity by using a closely related but less pathogenic virus has been also explored for the development of a LASV vaccine. Thus, a reassortant (called ML29) between Mopeia, an OW arenavirus considered to be non-pathogenic to humans, and LASV has shown some promising results (Carrion et al., 2007) , but detailed safety and efficacy studies have not been completed. An alternative approach for the development of a LF vaccine would be the use of reverse genetics to generate biologically contained versions of LASV in a similar way as described for Ebola virus (Halfmann et al., 2008) and influenza (Martinez-Sobrido and Garcia-Sastre, 2010). Recent work with LCMV has provided strong support for the feasibility of this approach (Flatz et al., 2010) to generate a safe and effective LASV vaccine. Likewise, the use of live-attenuated tri-segmented Candid #1 expressing relevant LASV T-cell epitopes could be used to induce protective immunity against JUNV and LASV.",13.79549736482155,8.387016564069073

As a result primary or recurrent infections do not induce protective immunity until later in life (Henderson et al., 1979; Glezen et al., 1986) . Natural protection against viral disease results from a combination of antibody, cell-mediated and T-helper cell immunity. This combination of responses target the virus before infection of host cells as well as destroying cells that have already been infected with virus. Therefore, potentially an ideal vaccine would need to stimulate humoral, cellular and T-helper responses similar to those induced by natural infection. Vaccine development has been hampered by the requirement for early-life vaccination, the confounding effects of poor neonatal immune responses, the presence of maternal antibodies, the difficulties in balancing immunogenicity and attenuation and the risk of vaccineinduced disease. Mucosal immunization may overcome the immune suppressive effects of maternal antibodies. 4.1.3.1. FI-vaccines. The widely recognised need for an effective RSV vaccine has also been held back by the adverse events following the implementation of the FI-RSV vaccine. This vaccine was developed in the 1960s but not only was it poorly effective it infamously induced more severe RSV-related disease upon natural infection in clinical trials (Kapikian et al., 1969; Kim et al., 1969) . The vaccine induced high serum antibody titres that were of low neutralising activity, lymphocytes with an enhanced RSV-specific proliferative response and blood eosinophilia . These observations were repeated in mice given the same vaccine or the G protein of RSV. Enhanced disease involved eosinophilia of the lung (Srikiatkhachorn & Braciale, 1997b; Tripp et al., 2000) and aberrant CD4+ T cells releasing Th2 cytokines (IL-4, -5, -10 and -13) (Waris et al., 1996; Srikiatkhachorn & Braciale, 1997b; Tripp et al., 2000) . Reduced IL-12 and CD8+ responses were also detected (Waris et al., 1996; Aung et al., 1999) . FIbovine RSV has also been tested in calves and also induces the development of immunopathology, ineffective neutralising antibodies and induced inflammatory responses leading to eosinophil influx into the lung and enhanced IgE production upon subsequent infection (Gershwin et al., 1998; Antonis et al., 2003; Kalina & Gershwin, 2004) . As is the case with RSV in mice the FI-bovine RSV did not induce long-term T cell memory . Thus it has been proposed that vaccines did not possess sufficient neutralising antibody or CTL responses and on subsequent infection the virus was not cleared but induced a potent Th2 response that exacerbated disease. 4.1.3.2. Subunit vaccines. Subunit vaccines are not associated with enhancing disease and may have potential applicability. However, the variability of human viruses is an issue that must be taken into account in the development of subunit vaccines. For RSV, vaccination with the F protein confers cross-protective immunity whereas only group-specific immunity is developed when the G protein is used (Sullender et al., 1990; Simard et al., 1997) .",13.860858081347775,8.054488068320811

Furthermore, reversion of the S protein mutation resulted in a nonlethal infection with no clinical disease. Introduction of the S protein and nsp9 mutations either alone or combined into the Urbani infectious clone failed to induce a lethal infection in young BALB/c mice indicating that the S protein and nsp9 mutations were necessary but not sufficient to induce severe disease. Given that 6 mutations were present in MA15, the additional mutations in ORF1a, ORF1b, and the M gene may have lead to enhanced disease by promoting interactions with host cell proteins involved in viral replication (88, 89) . Alternatively, these mutations may also alter the host response as STAT −/− mice progressed more rapidly to a terminal endpoint when inoculated with MA15 compared to wild-type virus (90) .",12.635522449459476,7.792154830253168

This includes the direct introduction of plasmid DNA containing the gene encoding the antigen against which an immune response is sought by incorporating antigens into appropriate host tissues and the in situ production of the target antigen(s). The advantages of this approach over the traditional approaches is that it stimulates both B-and T-cell responses, the vaccine has improved stability, the absence of any infectious agents and the relative ease of large scale manufacture [93] . Vaccines are generally used as biological medicinal products for the prophylaxis of infectious disease, but DNA vaccines are also being developed for therapeutic use (e.g., against infectious disease or other diseases such as cancer). Using genes from a variety of infectious agents, including influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, rabies virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus, malaria and mycoplasma, many scientific publications [93] explore the potential of DNA vaccination and immune responses in animals. For nucleic acid and viral vectorbased vaccines, bio-distribution studies are necessary to determine the tissue distribution following administration and the potential for the vector to integrate into the host genome [93, 94] . The design of nonclinical safety tests should take into consideration the use of the DNA vaccine and the risk/benefit situation. In addition to following GLP requirements for preclinical toxicology studies (see above), DNA studies should also evaluate any local inflammatory response (e.g., myositis), organ specific autoimmunity, immunopathology, and other relevant parameters. In particular, where the encoded antigen is a self-antigen, or may show self-antigen mimicry, a wider range of studies (including auto-antibodies) may be necessary to address the specific concerns [93] .",12.737810922028329,7.1439728988474585

Before an outbreak of airborne diseases within a city, how to determine an appropriate containment area for effective vaccination strategies is unknown. This research treats airborne disease spreads as geo-social interaction patterns, because viruses transmit among different groups of people over geographical locations through human interactions and population movement. Previous research argued that an appropriate scale identified through human geo-social interaction patterns can provide great potential for effective vaccination. However, little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of such vaccination at large scales (e.g., city) that are characterized by spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement. This article therefore aims to understand the impact of geo-social interaction patterns on effective vaccination in the urbanized area of Portland, Oregon. To achieve this goal, we simulate influenza transmission on a large-scale location-based social network to 1) identify human geo-social interaction patterns for designing effective vaccination strategies, and 2) and evaluate the efficacy of different vaccination strategies according to the identified geo-social patterns.

Moving forward, integration of systems biology technologies is required to comprehensively chart the antiviral landscape, combining findings from transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, epigenetic, and single cell analyses into predictive models of the antiviral response. The importance of systems integration was recently highlighted by the observation of notable discordance between transcript and protein levels in peptide-stimulated antigen specific CD8+ T cells (Hukelmann et al., 2015) . Despite the utility of systems biology approaches, a notable challenge has been the extraction of meaningful information from the extensive data sets that are generated.

A critical next step is experimental testing and refinement of predictive models, a too often overlooked process referred to as biologic validation. Further application of systems biology approaches will allow for the dissection of antiviral responses within traditionally difficult to study cell populations, such as rare primary cells and human clinical samples, allowing for a much needed enhanced understanding of cell type specific antiviral responses. Finally, systems biology approaches have the potential to redefine the field of personalized medicine, allowing treatment and vaccination strategies to be designed with host genetics in mind (Leroy and Qiang, 2012) . In summary, the continued implementation of systems biology approaches will be essential for improving our understanding of viral pathogenesis and antiviral immunity, revealing novel targets for therapeutic and vaccination strategies.",13.892297667312278,4.438442057462214

The number of cases of serogroup C meningococcal disease was 527 and 59 in the prevaccination period and post-vaccination period, respectively. Among persons with age between 14 months and 19 years the number of cases of serogroup C disease reduced from 332 cases in the pre-vaccination period to only three cases during the postvaccination period. These three patients had not been vaccinated. The number of serogroup C isolates among persons younger than 14 months decreased from 35 to 18 cases and that among persons older than 18 years was reduced from 160 to 36 cases in the post-vaccination period. This reduction of cases of serogroup C disease among non-vaccines might be indicative for herd protection, although the bimonthly distribution of cases of serogroup C disease shows that the decline started already before the introduction of the vaccine independent of the age group. Conclusions: Since 2002, the incidence of meningococcal disease in the Netherlands is declining, which is partly caused by the natural fluctuation in the incidence of serogroup B as well as serogroup C meningococcal disease. Nevertheless, the vaccination against serogroup C meningococcal disease by one shot at the age of 14 month was very effective and contributed significantly to the decline in the incidence of meningococcal disease; after the introduction: of the vaccine, cases of serogroup C meningococcal disease were no longer observed among vaccines by the NRLBM. Objectives: Currently, two formulations of pneumococcal vaccines are available, which prevents invasive disease in adults and children. However, these vaccines will not protect against the majority of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes. Highly conserved surface proteins as vaccines may circumvent this problem. Methods: S. pneumoniae surface proteins were isolated after mutanolysin treatment and identified via the proteomics platform at ACE BioSciences. The technology applied includes one-dimensional and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gelelectrophoreses as well as an in-solution based strategy, in combination with mass spectrometry. Identified proteins were extensively screened in a process, including in silico, in vitro and in vivo validation criteria. As an example, target RNA was detected with RT-PCR in infected tissue and sequenced in different S. pneumoniae serotypes to assess the possible role during infection, the variability and the conservation amongst these serotypes. Finally five candidates were selected, expressed in E. coli and purified for immunisation experiments. Animal efficacy data was demonstrated in a mouse sepsis model, where mice were vaccinated with the candidate proteins and challenged with S. pneumoniae D39 strain. Immunogenicity was tested applying ELISA technology. Results: We identified more than 280 S. pneumoniae surface proteins. Five proteins were selected as vaccine candidates. These proteins were detected in at least 40 different serotypes of S. pneumoniae and were expressed in S. pneumoniae during infection. Moreover at least two candidates showed protection in a sepsis animal model (p < 0.05 (t-test) for CFU/ml blood 6h after challenge with S. pneumoniae D39 compared with a group vaccinated with an unrelated protein) Conclusion: We identified two promising S. pneumoniae vaccine candidates with the ACE BioSciences proteomics platform, which were validated in vivo in an animal sepsis model.

One explanation is selection bias: if more severe clinical cases are reported and if these cases are also more likely to have vaccination status recorded within Disease Watchdog, this could result in vaccination status appearing as less of a risk factor. Equally, this finding may simply demonstrate the multifactorial nature of this disease, with other factors such as co-infection, stress, parasites and nutrition, potentially influencing the outcome in these cases. Vaccination against CPV with a live attenuated vaccine is reported to prevent the development of clinical signs, reduce viral shedding, limit disease severity and reduce hospitalisation time, all together resulting in significantly lower case fatality rates in vaccinated dogs compared to unvaccinated dogs (Meunier et al., 1985; Spibey et al., 2008) . These patterns were not found in the present study (Table 1) : there was no significant difference in case fatality rates between dogs that were unvaccinated (16.4%) and those dogs that had received a vaccination within the previous 12 months. Age should be considered as a potential confounding factor for this result; however, the majority (89.5%) of dogs that had a history of vaccination within the previous 12 months that developed disease due to CPV were less than 12 months of age. In addition, exposure to parvovirus was not measured in this study and might account for the lack of association between veterinary clinic reported vaccination status and risk of parvovirus death. It is likely that vaccination still remains an essential factor in providing immunity and therefore reduced disease and overall case fatality rates.",14.731489089183738,5.550472430605148

Education of those at risk is important, so that they can avoid exposure where possible and, following exposure, can seek proper treatment and avoid ineffective remedies. Furthermore, the governments of countries with high rabies burdens must become more aware of the extent of the problem -not only is the burden of mortality high, but postexposure prophylaxis is also very expensive -so that additional resources are allocated to reducing rabies incidence. Another important approach is to decrease viral presence in the dog population through vaccination of domestic dogs. This has been successful in the Americas, and investigation of dog ownership in Tanzania indicates that it may also be a feasible approach there 2 . Vaccination of dogs is inexpensive, although 60-70% of the dog population must be vaccinated to affect disease spread; this requires a long-term strategy and continued commitment to such a programme. New cheaper, single-dose, oral vaccines for humans would make widespread vaccination of the population possible; several new vaccines have shown promise, but none is close to being put into general use.

The goal was to vaccinate 500,000 health care workers, but only a very small number actually received the vaccine. Many health care workers declined vaccination because of concerns about adverse reactions [45] . An advisory panel recommended against routine vaccination of emergency physicians because of concern that even a small risk for adverse reactions outweighed the minimal benefit that could be expected from smallpox vaccination in the absence of smallpox transmission anywhere in the world [46] . In the event of even a single smallpox case or a credible imminent threat, the benefits of smallpox vaccination would become clearer. Performing a rigorous scientific analysis of the risks and benefits for smallpox vaccination is impossible, because the true risk of a smallpox attack is unknown. The probability that any individual physician would be among those to see the first few cases of a smallpox outbreak is extremely low. Because smallpox vaccine can provide protection up to several days after exposure, a strategy to ensure timely vaccination of exposed health care workers and the general public if a smallpox case is identified would avoid the risk for unnecessary adverse reactions to smallpox vaccine while smallpox does not exist.

Several aspects of veterinary livestock practice underscore the need for effective passive immu-nizing agents. Livestock producers resist the idea of active immunization against infectious diseases even when efficacious vaccines are available. Much of this resistance is due to the economic realities of livestock production where profit margins are narrow and the cost of vaccination is weighed against the risk of experiencing disease outbreaks. Unfortunately, in many cases the risks are weighed incorrectly and the veterinarian is then called in to halt the rapid spread of infectious disease through a highly susceptible population of livestock. The value of passive immunization in these situations is unquestionable, as evidenced by the apparent success of the K99-specific monoclonal antibody in controlling outbreaks of fatal diarrhea in neonatal calves due to enteropathogenic E. coli. In other situations, the risk of disease is recognized to be high and active immunization is carried out, but management factors preclude the value of vaccination.

If this relationship is causal, however, the substantial proportion of diabetes in each of the two infections suggests that introducing effective strategies for diabetes prevention may reduce the severity of a significant number of SARI conditions. Specific systematic vaccination intervention strategies against SARI diseases should be also considered for patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular conditions.82 This should be viewed as a key public health strategy in preventing SARI-associated morbidity and mortality.83 During the 1957–58 pandemic and in response to substantial morbidity and mortality, the US Surgeon General recommended annual influenza vaccination for individuals with chronic debilitating disease, people aged ≥65 years and pregnant women.84 For these high-risk groups, the first recommendation of national universal seasonal influenza vaccination was established in 2010 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).85 Recently, influenza vaccination was demonstrated to be associated with preventing allcause hospitalization in infected subjects.86 However, despite numerous recommendations from several public health organizations across the world (e.g., CDC, WHO, etc.) to administer SARI vaccines (e.g., influenza) annually to diabetic patients, vaccination rate in this vulnerable sub-population remains low.87-89 The current level of vaccination falls far short of the 2010 national health objectives call for a 90% rate to all elderly people (≥65 years of age) and 60% for younger people who have risk factors (e.g., diabetes).88 The prevalence of chronic diseases is rising in middle- and low-income countries as populations age and lifestyles and diets change. Further studies are being undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of other comorbidities in H1N1 and MERS-CoV.

Our study expands the current knowledge of the in vivo mechanisms of complement-mediated antiviral immunity, and in particular suggests that activation of complement by distinct pathways may control pathogens by triggering different effector arms of antiviral immunity. A limitation of our study is that it does not address the precise mechanism by which the three complement activation pathways stimulate different adaptive immune responses; the differences could be because of quantitative or qualitative variation in the generation of C3 or C5 activation fragments. Regardless, a fully functional complement cascade is clearly important for controlling and clearing WNV given that antibody and CD8+ T cells both are essential for protection (14, 16, 17). It is intriguing to consider that severe WNV infection in humans, which occurs infrequently (∼1/150), could be more common in patients with dysfunctional complement responses. Although complete deficiencies of complement proteins are rare, heterozygous deficiencies of C4 and MBL are common (59) and have been associated with an increased risk of viral diseases (30, 49, 51, 60). As therapies against WNV become available, it will be important to target high-risk populations. Depressed levels of complement proteins or reduced complement activity could explain why some seemingly healthy patients develop severe disease after WNV infection. Genetic studies that evaluate the risk factors of neuroinvasive WNV infection in humans should include an analysis of common complement gene allelic polymorphisms.",8.09584890012586,7.171462714390212

Anticipated decision regret is an attitude of people which leads them to take actions that are directed at preventing possible future incidents. If I take this preventive measure now, it will mean that I do not have to blame myself (or get blamed by others) for not having done everything to prevent that incident from happening. This attitude also can be observed in health care. A growing number of preventive screening tests are offered that provide information of the chance of developing some kind of disease. It is often not taken in consideration that the chance of really getting this disease is very small. And it is possible that the measures that are taken to prevent the disease negatively influence lifestyles. The Dutch medical sociologist Tjeerd Tijmstra (2001) gives some—often hilarious—examples of anticipated decision regret: if a mother gets a screening test for her child offered for a disease for which the risk is 1 in 90,000, there is a great willingness to participate. And even if it is explained to people that the chance of having a car accident while driving to the clinic is about as much as that particular risk, still many people decide to go on. Their motivation seems to be: suppose our baby does develop that disease, then we should not forgive ourselves not to have done everything to prevent it. There are signals that this anticipated decision regret has become an attitude in security issues also. But in the field of security governments and other public agencies (such as scientific organizations) are bearers of the attitude more than individual citizens. After 9/11—let it be repeated again—security measures against possible terrorist attacks have been given an enormous priority. It looks as if governments are willing to invest a lot of energy in minimizing the chances of terrorist attacks. They do not want to take the risk that they have not done everything to prevent an assault. This attitude can be based on experience. Officials of the Dutch government were reproached for not having done enough to prevent the murder of film director Theo van Gogh (2004). These reproaches have led to decisions that are directed at minimizing the chance of new attacks. With—in general—societal and political support a good deal of money and a lot of energy are devoted to this topic. It is not farfetched to suppose that this is one of the effects of our common anticipated decision regret.",7.808490628709183,6.775802664109493

Through various diseases, comorbidities have been associated with outcome.[88], [89], [90], [91], [92] Screening of significant extrahepatic comorbid conditions is the cornerstone of the health assessment required before placement on a waiting list. The UCLA score was developed with the aim of identifying variables associated with 3-month or in-hospital mortality after LT in patients with very high MELD scores (≥ 40). Among the evaluated variables, authors chose the Charlson-comorbidity index (CCI)93 that had already been proven in a recalibrated form to be efficient in determining outcome in an LT population.94 Another score named the “cardiac risk score” was defined by the presence of at least 1 of the following variables: severe valvular disease, coronary artery disease with more than 70% stenosis or previous revascularization, history of myocardial infarction, history of ventricular and/or atrial arrhythmias, elevated pre-orthotopic LT troponin I (> 0.2 ng/ml), and/or new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography. Indeed, cardiovascular disease was shown to be associated with short-term outcome, particularly in the first month following LT (mortality or cardiovascular events).[95], [96] MELD score, pretransplant septic shock, but also age-adjusted CCI and cardiac risk score were associated with outcomes using a multivariate analysis. In the final score named UCLA futility risk score (UCLA-FRS) an important weight was given to comorbidity including the cardiac risk index and the CCI: UCLA-FRS = 0.5 × (MELD score) + 5 × (1 = CCI ≥ 6; 0 = CCI < 6) + 4 × (1 = cardiac risk; 0 = no cardiac risk) + 3 × (1 = septic shock; 0 = no septic shock).97 In a recent study reporting results of LT in patients with OFs, this score seemed to be helpful in selecting candidates for LT when considering predicted and observed post-LT survival rates.98 Another study aimed to compare available scores in 2 independent cohorts of transplanted patients with high MELD scores (Swiss and UNOS cohort). Most prediction scores showed low positive predictive values for post-transplant mortality despite good specificity. Among these scores, the BAR score was the only score linearly associated with complications.99 The usefulness of this score, which was designed for the more critically ill patients, seems restricted to this population based on its performance in other cohorts100 (Table 3).",6.8756353306528855,4.063378636709345

Although, in the latter example, Pseudomonas was isolated in three samples (from a total of nine) collected from this nurse care, using PFGE none of the isolates matched with the strain isolated from the patient. Welders and foundry workers are also considered at occupational risk for P. aeruginosa pneumonia, probably due to dust containing metals.22,30,31 Nevertheless, machine operators using metalworking fluids are also at the same risk.32 Zell et al.33 reported the case of a healthy young man who acquired a P. aeruginosa pneumonia working in a place with aerosolized contaminated metalworking fluid, and mentioned that this CAP had been reported to the industrial injuries insurance companies as an occupational disease. Aqueous oil emulsions used in metal processing are frequently contaminated or colonized by Gram-negative bacteria, where they survive over a period of up to 250 days, and may show very fast proliferation.34
Pseudomonas represents the genus that most frequently colonizes cutting fluids.34 Indeed, P. aeruginosa was isolated from metalworking fluid (cutting fluid) in 17% of 150 examined samples in France,35 and in 48% (of 72 examined samples) in Zagreb (Croatia).34 Favoring this occupational correlation, Harrod et al.36 conducted an experimental model to evaluate the impact of inhaled diesel engine emissions (DEE) in modulating clearance of P. aeruginosa. Their findings concluded that environmental levels of DEE could decrease the clearance of P. aeruginosa and increase lung pathogenicity. In this report, P. aeruginosa was isolated from the metalworking fluid that was collected from the machine operated by the patient. The PGFE from both strains showed the same bacterial DNA-pattern, strongly arguing in favor of this fluid being the source of infection.",7.803936938441932,3.290479831893244
