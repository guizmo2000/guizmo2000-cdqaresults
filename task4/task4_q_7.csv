Thus, it is essential to have laboratory animal models that replicate the major features of illness in humans and provide selective and reproducible results. This selected animal model needs to mimic human influenza, in terms of similarity of clinical signs, histopathologic changes and virus replication kinetics. A number of animal models such as mice [3] , cotton rats [4] , guinea pigs [5] , hamsters [6] , ferrets [7] , non-human primates, such as macaques [8] have been developed, but many gaps, including clinical symptoms and transmission, remain in our understanding.",26.289385050211937,12.757492543643819

Generally, mice, guinea pigs and hamsters models are widely used for influenza virus research. However, they do not exhibit some of the clinical symptoms detected in humans such as nasal exudates, fever, sneezing, and coughing, and only display hypothermia and weight loss. Additionally mice, unlike other rodents like guinea pigs, cotton rats and hamsters, cannot be infected with primary human virus clinical isolates readily, and thus are in mostly used in the research of mouse-adapted strains [9] . Therefore, the pathogenesis of influenza virus could not be studied adequately in rodent models as generally recognized. It is well-known that ferrets and non-human primates (e.g. macaques) are excellent mammalian animal models for studies of influenza virus pathogenicity and host immunity, and moreover, the clinical signs of influenza virus infection in ferrets resemble those in humans [10, 11] .

Animal models are useful in the study of influenza virus pathogenesis. Because of various limitations in current laboratory animal models, it is essential to develop new alternative animal models for influenza virus research aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to virus infection in human. Method: We investigated the replicative efficiency of influenza H1N1 virus (classic strain (Influenza A/PR/8/34), seasonal influenza isolate (A/Guangzhou/GIRD/02/09) and swine-origin human influenza virus (A/Guangzhou/GIRD/ 07/09)) at Day1,2,4,6 and 9 p.i. using TCID 50 and qPCR assay in tree shrew model.

Lectinhistochemistry analysis was conducted to identify the distribution of SAŒ±2,3 Gal and SAŒ±2,6 Gal receptors in the lung and trachea. Results: The infected tree shrew displayed mild or moderate systemic and respiratory symptoms and pathological changes in respiratory tracts. The human H1N1 influenza virus may replicate in the upper respiratory tract of tree shrews. Analysis of the receptors distribution in the respiratory tract of tree shrews by lectinhistochemistry showed that sialic acid (SA)Œ±2,6-Gal receptors were widely distributed in the trachea and nasal mucosa, whereas (SA)Œ±2,3-Gal receptor was the main receptor in the lung tissue.",19.302424897303265,10.402214285078177

Although rodents have served as invaluable models for studying SCI mechanisms and therapeutic development, larger mammals, in particular non-human primates, share a closer size, neuroanatomy, and physiology to humans. Importantly, their larger size provides a more relevant platform for drug development, bioengineering inventions, and electrophysiological and rehabilitation studies. Nonetheless, both small and large animal models of SCI have limitations in their ability to predict the outcome in human SCI. One important factor is high degree of variability in the nature of SCI incidence, severity and location of the injury in human SCI, while in laboratory animal models, these variabilities are less (36) . Values acquired by clinical scoring systems such as ASIA or Frankel scoring systems lack the consistency of the data acquired from laboratory settings, which makes the translation of therapeutic interventions from experimental to clinical settings challenging (36) . A significant effect from an experimental treatment in consistent laboratory settings may not be reproducible in clinical settings due to high variability and heterogeneity in human populations and their injuries (36) . To date, several pharmacological and cellular preclinical discoveries have led to human clinical trials based on their efficacy in improving the outcomes of SCI in small animal models. However, the majority of these trials failed to reproduce the same efficacy in human SCI. Thus, in pre-clinical studies, animal models, and study designs should be carefully chosen to reflect the reality of clinical setting as closely as possible (36) . Larger animals provide the opportunity to refine promising therapeutic strategies prior to testing in human SCI; however, their higher cost, need for specialized facilities and small subject (sample) size have limited their use in SCI research (50) . Thus, rodents are currently the most commonly employed models for preclinical discoveries and therapeutic development, while the use of larger animals is normally pursued for late stage therapies that have shown efficacy and promise in small animal models.

However, the constant increase of animal studies in the last decades is in contrast to their reproducibility in humans (Hackam and Redelmeier, 2006) . Hackam and colleagues identified 2,000 articles published between 1980 and 2006 in seven leading scientific journals that regularly publish animal studies (Hackam and Redelmeier, 2006) . Seventy-six out of 2,000 were highly cited with a median citation count of 889.

However, rodents and in particular mice are used more frequently as a pneumonia model organisms. Rapid reproductive rate, small size, less complicated handling, the ability to reproduce and compare results with already published bacterial and viral mono-infections, detailed knowledge of genetics and immune responses, and a plethora of available reagents to study infections in mice are reasons for the use of these animals. To avoid variations in responses due to genetic diversity inbred mice strains are useful tools for studies aiming to elucidate molecular mechanisms of diseases.

If possible, we will perform challenge experiments to confirm that the enhanced immunity leads to better protection, to advance the bestperforming candidate into a suitable animal model for MARV, and to compare PCP-II with RIBI and QS-21 in future studies.",21.970069808855445,12.787488493405956

Ferrets and macaques have increased tropisms to many primary influenza isolates but both are expensive to maintain and difficult to house. Based largely on their recapitulation of human disease signs, ferrets have also been used to derive serotyping reagents for assessing antigenic distance between isolates and potential vaccine strains. However, recent reports suggest that ferrets may not faithfully mimic human immune responses, and that serological tests using ferret sera may not accurately assess vaccine strain efficacy [1, 2] . Therefore, there is a need to develop additional permissive small animal models of influenza virus infection that exhibit virus shedding. Serial samples collected from such animal models allow the investigator to determine both the titer and duration of virus shedding from individual animals at multiple times without euthanasia. Further characterization of animal models capable of replicating and transmitting unadapted human, avian, and/or swine influenza viruses can be valuable for studying and testing new and improved vaccines, immunobiotics and anti-virals.

Cohorts of animals are infected and euthanized, and viral load or immune responses are measured in predetermined tissues. This produces static snapshots of replication only at specific times and specific sites within the animal. Moreover, inherent animal-to-animal variability introduces significant confounding effects, resulting in studies that require hundreds of animals to acquire statistical significance. The power of these traditional approaches can be complemented, and many of these limitations overcome, by using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) (Fig 1) . BLI detects light produced by luciferase enzymes.

As an example of this, using a gene knock-in approach and a mouse-adapted virus strain, Gorman and colleagues recently developed an immunocompetent transgenic mouse model of ZIVK infection by replacing the mouse STAT2 by the human STAT2 [169] .

We describe the histopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings from rhesus macaque and common marmoset animal models of MERS-CoV infection. The main histopathological findings in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were varying degrees of pulmonary lesions, including pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, haemorrhage, degeneration and necrosis of the pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. The characteristic inflammatory cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. Based on these observations, the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets appeared to develop chronic and acute pneumonia, respectively. MERS-CoV antigens and viral RNA were identified in type I and II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, and ultrastructural observations showed that viral protein was found in type II pneumocytes and inflammatory cells in both species. Correspondingly, the entry receptor DDP4 was found in type I and II pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages.

However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species.

Although there are some differences in the length of gestation, placental structure, and fetal development between humans and animal models, many structural and functional parallels exist, [94] [95] [96] which serve as tractable platforms for evaluating the safety and efficacy of various therapies during pregnancy. Similar to humans, pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have a hemochorial placenta, and their relatively short gestation and large litters are advantageous for performing high throughput screening of candidate therapeutics for safety and efficacy. Preclinical behavioral testing of rodent offspring has proven to be a promising avenue for identifying and predicting adverse effects associated with prenatal drug exposure in children. 97 Both rodent and rabbit models have been instrumental in testing teratogenic effects of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treating malaria in pregnant women. These studies concluded that drug-related teratogenic effects are limited to the first trimester, which supports the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that artemisinin may be administered only during the second or third trimester in pregnant women. 98, 99 One limitation of mouse and rat models, however, is their inability to recapitulate certain elements of human congenital disease. For instance, because murine CMV is not transmitted vertically as it is in humans, other animal models, including guinea pigs and nonhuman primates, are required for studying this aspect of disease pathogenesis. Studies in pregnant nonhuman primates have been instrumental for the identification of CD4 + T cell responses as critical for early control of CMV infection and transmission during pregnancy, 100 and studies in guinea pigs have demonstrated that a single-cycle infectious CMV vaccine induces immune responses similar to natural infection and protects against congenital infection. 101 Guinea pigs are also a useful model of chlamydial genital infection in humans. Experimental venereal infection with Chlamydophila caviae mimics disease associated with C. trachomatis in humans, including both sexual and perinatal transmission. Guinea pigs have therefore served as a useful model for testing candidate vaccines and treatments. 102 Rabbits continue to serve as an important model of venereal infection with Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, which is associated with congenital disease in humans. While natural infection in rabbits is associated with the species-specific T. paraluiscanuculi, rabbits can be experimentally inoculated with human T. pallidum, and have been instrumental in testing the efficacy of candidate vaccines. 103 Many mammalian species, including rodents, 104 ruminants, 105 and nonhuman primates, 40, 106 are susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and demonstrate similar fetal complications when infection occurs during pregnancy. Studies in various animal models have uniquely contributed to our understanding of placental listeriosis and serve as a platform for evaluating prevention strategies. 107, 108 Finally, mice, 85 cotton rats, 86 guinea pigs, 88 and sheep 87 are all susceptible to infection with RSV, and vaccination of pregnant animals has facilitated the development and testing of maternal immunization strategies for protecting against neonatal RSV.

Ferrets are the closest known model for human transmission (see Box 4). Respiratory-droplet transmission studies in ferrets, and potentially in other animal models, have shown a remarkably strong correlation with human transmissibility of influenza A strains (Buhnerkempe et al., 2015) . While these assays are not perfectly predictive, they may be the most reliable way at present to assess the transmission potential of a virus in human populations. Here a partial counterexample to their overall strong predictive value is H7N9 avian influenza isolates from human zoonotic cases. These viruses transmit in ferrets, albeit less efficiently than human seasonal strains, yet humanto-human transmission has been extremely rare in the hundreds of human zoonotic cases caused by H7N9 (Buhnerkempe et al., 2015) . A challenge is the expense and practical challenge of using large enough numbers of ferrets (Buhnerkempe et al., 2015; Belser et al., 2013; Nishiura et al., 2013) to assess transmissibility; this will remain a technique of limited throughput for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, the value of ferret testing for risk assessment can be enhanced in at least two ways: first, by standardizing the conditions for ferret transmission experiments, so these can be more confidently compared between laboratories; and second, by continuing to combine ferret studies with studies of viral traits and sequence/structural studies to further identify correlates of transmissibility in ferrets.",20.887402455029626,11.306247373428155

Having an animal model that can recapitulate human disease is essential for vaccine and therapeutic development as well as testing. For a potential animal model to be susceptible to infection, the virus must be able to 1.) gain entry into host cells; 2.) overcome the host's antiviral responses; and 3.) disseminate virus following infection to allow infection of other neighbouring cells and tissues. It is also of importance for the model to be able to recapitulate human disease and viral transmission modes. When evaluating the ability of an animal to be infected by a virus and serve as a model, viral shedding, clinical disease, and seroconversion should be determined. The past animal models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not universal due to the expression of the virus-specific cellular receptors for entry [63] . As SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not share a cellular receptor, they do not share the same host range and susceptibility, which includes research animal models [64] . Cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, and cats were some of the first animals to be determined susceptible to SARS-CoV [65, 66] . The advantage of ferrets is that they are a smaller animal compared to non-human primates and also are able to recapitulate some of the clinical symptoms and transmission kinetics of human respiratory viruses including coughing, sneezing, fever, and weight loss [67] . Although mice can be infected with SARS-CoV, as shown by recovery of vRNA and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, infection does not cause severe disease [68] . However, SARS-CoV could be passaged in mice (15 times) for the establishment of a model with clinical features [69] . After the identification of MERS-CoV, it was quickly determined that typical research animal models were not susceptible to the virus including mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets. Larger non-human primate models, such as Rhesus macaques and common marmoset were determined susceptible. To make use of small animal models, transgenic mice have been engineered for MERS-CoV susceptibility through expression of the human DPP4 receptor [70] . Other attempts at other mouse model developments were not successful, including an immunocompromised 129/SATA1-/-1 mouse [63] . Having an understanding of the animal models and model development previously utilized for the other coronaviruses of interest will aid in the development of a model for 2019-nCoV. As is necessary, elucidation of the receptor will help guide in development, and creating a clinical picture of the acute symptoms in humans will be essential for vaccine and antiviral evaluation.",18.55053280868215,10.895589777602046

ZIKV exhibited tropism for the testes with strong immunoreactivity in reproductive organs (Figs 4 & 7) . Histologically, minimal focal testicular degeneration in two bats ( Fig  2) suggests viral related pathology may be minimal. In humans it has yet to be completely elucidated what reproductive organs harbor ZIKV, it has been determined that semen contains ZIKV both in both vasectomized and unvasectomized men [27, 28] . This suggests that ZIKV is sequestered in the testes and/or accessory sex glands. Mouse models have demonstrated ZIKV infection and associated pathology in the testes [29] [30] [31] of humanized BLT mouse model with infection primarily targeting macrophages and Leydig cells [32] . Limited investigation has been done relating to infection of accessory sex glands in mouse models, but one study that assessed the prostate found no virus, possibly due to differential expression of the receptor candidate in the testes but not in the prostate [29] . For this experiment the finding of viral antigen and viral RNA in the testes but not in the prostate is consistent with published animal models and may suggest the potential for bats to serve as another animal model. Three bats had histopathological alterations in the hippocampus at later time points and one bat had viral nucleic acid present in the brain as determined by qRT-PCR demonstrating tropism for the CNS, a tissue predilection also documented in humans and animal models. ZIKV has a predilection for nervous tissue in animal studies and disease manifestation in humans. As a neurological teratogen, ZIKV has been detected in the brain mononuclear cells in human newborns with fatal microcephaly and fetal miscarriages. Histological lesions are varied but may include parenchymal calcification, microglial nodules, gliosis, cell degeneration, mononuclear infiltration and necrosis [33] [34] [35] . In non-human animal models, evidence for viral tropism has been found in brain and/or peripheral nervous tissue [36] [37] [38] [39] . In immunocompromised mouse models, the virus has a predilection for the brain but with the mice engineered for specific immune traits it is difficult to know to what extent this recapitulates natural ZIKV pathophysiology [40] . In the bats used in this experiment, evidence of ZIKVinduced pathology in the brain is consistent with what has been seen in human newborns and fetuses. The novel finding of co-localizing ZIKV antigen in bat Iba1 + microglial/macrophage cells lends support to the earlier evidence of microglial cell infection via Axl ligand bridging ZIKV particles to glial cells [41] . Iba1 (aka, allograft inflammatory factor 1, Aif1) is a microglia/macrophage-specific calcium-binding protein, which has actin-bundling activity that participates in membrane ruffling and phagocytic activity of activated microglia. Activated microglial cells appeared with increased ability of cell migration and phagocytosis, which is controlled by remodeling of membrane cytoskeleton [42] . The morphology of cells with co-localization in the brain of infected bats is consistent with activated microglia depicting prominent branched processes. Recent primate models in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques demonstrated similar viral distribution of ZIKV antigen to that in bats, described herein. High-level of ZIKV was evident in cerebellar neurons and the same studies documented involvement of Iba1 positive microglial cells in CNS infections. In primate models there is increasing evidence that ZIKV antigen was detected in individuals with the highest peak plasma viremia, which in part implies that ZIKV may initially seed the CNS by a passive spillover from circulating monocytes to resident microglial cells. This is further substantiated in all of human and animal studies, which did not show any evidence of disruption to BBB or viral distribution reminiscent of circumventricular distribution seen in alphavirus animal models [43] .",17.915685519988358,8.897611362631377

There are many reasons for this sobering report card, chief among them being persistent endemicity as a result of drug and insecticide resistance, inadequate support for malaria control programs, poor environmental management, the complex biology of the disease, as well as the regional variability not only in the parasite but also in the nature of its impact on specific populations and age groups. Another major challenge remains the lack of practical and affordable animal models that can faithfully reflect mechanisms of malaria pathogenesis and immunity in humans.

The viral nucleoprotein (NP) and ion channel matrix protein (M2) are highly conserved among different strains and various influenza A subtypes. Here, we investigate the relative efficacy of NP and M2 compared to HA in protecting against HPAI H5N1 virus. In mice, previous studies have shown that vaccination with NP and M2 in recombinant DNA and/or adenovirus vectors or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of HA. However, we find that the protective efficacy of NP and M2 diminishes as the virulence and dose of the challenge virus are increased. To explore this question in a model relevant to human disease, ferrets were immunized with DNA/rAd5 vaccines encoding NP, M2, HA, NP+M2 or HA+NP+M2. Only HA or HA+NP+M2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge. Therefore, while gene-based vaccination with NP and M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low challenge doses, it is insufficient to confer protective immunity against high challenge doses of H5N1 in ferrets. These immunogens may require combinatorial vaccination with HA, which confers protection even against very high doses of lethal viral challenge.",20.975848404510554,10.439130354702778

After the recent outbreaks, efforts to develop animal models with more clinically relevant isolates of the virus have been renewed. A rapid series of publications found that adult mice that lack type 1 (Œ±Œ≤; A129 and IFNAR ‚àí/‚àí strains) or types 1 and 2 (Œ±Œ≤/Œ≥; AG129 strain) interferon receptors are susceptible to lethal infection (Aliota et al. 2016; Lazear et al. 2016; Manangeeswaran et al. 2016; Rossi et al. 2016; Zmurko et al. 2016) . These models may have some relevance to human ZIKV infections in that, like many viruses, ZIKV gains advantages in human hosts by inhibiting interferon responses (Best 2017; Bowen et al. 2017; Schulz and Mossman 2016) . Because viruses may not be able to inhibit mouse-specific interferon pathways (Aguirre et al. 2012) , blocking them by other means, as in AG129 mice, may more closely mimic what happens in humans.

These animal models are indispensable for the deeper understanding of any diseases and safe and protective vaccine development process (Lorenzen et al., 2015) . The main criteria for the validation of animal models in preclinical studies are face validity, predictive validity and target validity. The face validity means that the proper similarity between the animal model and the human disease in terms of the biology and symptoms of the disease. However, assessing face validity is a tedious task due to the lack of understanding on the core biology of the disease symptoms. Predictive validity means the display of clinical interventions which exhibited similar effect in the animal models. This is also very difficult to achieve due to the incomplete correlation between animal models, the mechanism of human diseases and the incapability of standard drugs to active in many animal models. Target validity is another essential component for the validation of animal models in which the target under study must have an analogous function in the disease model as in the clinical condition (Denayer et al., 2014) . An ideal animal model is the one where an immunocompetent animal, on receiving the challenge virus at a realistic dose through a suitable inoculation route, is able to replicate the characteristics of a human disease as closely as possible (Doremalen and Munster, 2015) . Ferrets, hamsters, mice and other small laboratory animals are not ideal animal models for MERS-CoV owing to the variations in DPP4 receptor. The rhesus macaque and the common marmoset are the first non-human primate species (NPS) to be used as the animal models for MERS-CoV. Glycosylation of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) prevents its binding to S protein of MERS-CoV. Hence, transgenic hDPP4 (human DPP4) mice were developed as animal model (Peck et al., 2015) .

EV-A71 [194] , FMDV [12] , and yellow fever virus (YFV) [195] strains adapted to bind HSPG in cells are less prone to dissemination in animal models. In the same vein, after inoculation of HSPG-dependent CV-B3 [63] and DENV2 [196] variants, HSPG-independent revertants could be isolated from different sites. [69] [70] [71] . Finally, a recent study in a mouse model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection also corroborates a negative association between HSPG binding and viral spread. HBV undergoes a slow maturation process, in which the HSPG binding protein is exposed in a temperature-and time-dependent manner. Based on their observations, the authors suggested that HBV could use this process to avoid becoming trapped in the blood stream, where HSPG are highly expressed but the infection would be unproductive. With this strategy instead, the virus can reach the liver, and after binding HSPG, infect the cells via its receptor, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) [197] . Nonetheless, these studies present several limitations. First, animal models are often genetically modified to support viral infections (i.e., IFN [interferon] receptor knockout or transgenic expression of the viral receptors), second, inoculated viruses are animal-adapted, and finally, the inoculation route and infectious doses used are far from natural conditions. Additional reports in more relevant models are thus necessary to aid understanding of the true impact of HSPG binding on viral pathogenesis in humans.",18.10260836442304,10.339064976135862

If dengue proteases do not cleave most nonhuman forms of STING, this may at least partially explain why it has been so difficult to model dengue infection in immune-competent animals. Nonhuman primates infected with dengue virus generally don't develop clinical signs of disease, consistent with enhanced control of the virus compared to humans (Cassetti et al., 2010) . In fact, when human dengue viruses have been observed to replicate robustly in primate cell lines, these experiments have typically been done in cells such as Vero Rossi et al., 2012; Vasilakis et al., 2009) which are deficient in the type I interferon response (Osada et al., 2014; Desmyter et al., 1968) . Human dengue viruses also cannot cleave mouse STING ( Yu et al., 2012) and herein), consistent with the heightened control of this virus in mice as well (Cassetti et al., 2010) . Dengue virus will replicate to high titers in mice lacking key genes important for the interferon response, but for many reasons it is desirable to develop animal models in immune competent hosts (Cassetti et al., 2010) . STING now adds to a growing list of host proteins that regulate viral infection differently even in closely related host species (for example, [Stabell et al., 2016; Lou et al., 2016; Rowley et al., 2016; Kerr et al., 2015; Meyerson et al., 2015; Demogines et al., 2012; Stremlau et al., 2004; Demogines et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2015; Hueffer et al., 2003; Radoshitzky et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2012; Elde et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2012; Sawyer and Elde, 2012; Meyerson et al., 2017] ).

Differently from in vitro studies, the animal models present the clear advantage of a more close mimicry of the clinical setting. Unfortunately, a number of issues greatly limited the knowledge gained from these studies. The most common feature among the reviewed publications was the decision of electing to investigate only few, mostly Bcardiac enriched^miRNAs (e.g., miR-208, miR-1, and miR-133). This choice obviously led to a strong limitation to the novelty and potential new findings. Moreover, a key issue was the lessthan-optimal assessment of cardiotoxicity itself. Indeed, often the onset of heart dysfunction was not directly verified, either by instrumental evaluation (e.g., echography) or by dosage of circulating markers (e.g., troponins). Thus, the correlation between miRNA expression and cardiotoxicity was only assumed without verification. Another limitation was the lack of clear and detailed description of the methods used in many studies. Indeed, most authors generally referred to Bheart samples^without specifying whether whole hearts or just parts of them were used in their analysis, thus making a comparison between different investigations difficult. In general, there is a clear need of increased consistency in the methods used. Finally, an issue of paramount importance regards the normalization strategy for a robust assessment of miRNA expression by RT-qPCR. This strongly affects the reproducibility of results and should be taken seriously into consideration for a possible exploitation of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of DOX cardiotoxicity onset. Indeed, human-based studies pose greater challenges than animal models, because of the high variability in medical protocols and patients' responses and the difficulties in patients' recruitment and long medical follow-up. Thus, accurate and widely accepted research protocols should be implemented and adopted, to achieve reproducibility among different research groups and to pave the way to results of strong clinical relevance.",19.422170128623065,10.54800382869422

Studies with non-human primates [90, 91] have demonstrated that animals treated with sub-neutralizing levels of antibody develop higher serum viremia compared to untreated animals. However, attempts to reproduce DHF in non-human primates have been unsuccessful. Investigators have attempted with some success to develop mouse models of DENV infection and disease (reviewed in [92] ). The most successful mouse model of antibody enhanced severe disease is based on infecting interferon receptor-deficient AG129 mice with a mouse adapted strain of DENV2 [93, 94] . AG129 mice treated with anti-dengue monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal sera and then infected with DENV developed a lethal vascular leak disease, with similarities to DHF. The cells involved with ADE driven infection were Fc receptor bearing cells including sinusoidal endothelial cells in the liver. In addition to vascular leakage, the disease was characterized by elevated level of cytokines (TNFŒ±, IL-6, and IL-10), and thrombocytopenia, which is similar to severe DENV illness in humans [93, 94] . While specific cellular mechanisms leading to vascular leakage are likely to be different in humans and mice, especially mice deficient in interferon receptors, these animal studies establish that antibodies can enhance viral replication and induce host cytokines responses that lead to clinical outcomes similar to DHF/DSS.

These mineralizations were not due to ChAdOx1 RVF vaccination as they were also found in mock-vaccinated ewes and goats and bore no clinical significance. The foci were relatively small compared to the total area of the placentome. Such mineralizations have not been described previously in any of the virulent RVFV challenge studies done in pregnant animals, 41, 42 though the viral challenge in these studies was done later in gestation (second trimester) and vaccinated animals were followed to full term following challenge. The most likely explanation is that the mineralizations were an indicator of inflammation following viral infection as noted for other infectious diseases in animals and humans. [43] [44] [45] The high intravenous challenge dose used in this study would have ensured rapid dissemination of the virus to the placenta and others tissues that RVFV has tropism for, thus initiating a strong host inflammatory response. It is plausible that an alternative inoculation route (e.g. subcutaneous or intranasal or mosquito bite) may have resulted in a slower rate of placental infection with minimal histological evidence of inflammation. 40 Alternatively, the mineralizations may have been incidental, as occurs during the latter In summary, we have shown the ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine is safe for use in pregnant sheep and goats, elicits high titre RVFV nAbs, and provides protection against foetal loss. We have also provided a description of the pathology of RVFV infection in pregnant goats and compared this to that in pregnant sheep at the same stage of gestation using the same virus challenge strain, dose and inoculation route. That not all foetuses of ChAdOx1 RVFvaccinated goats were fully protected, despite having significantly higher RVFV nAb titres than those in ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated sheep (whose foetuses were all protected), suggests differences in key mechanisms of protection against foetal infection between the two species. Further studies comparing immune responses in the diverse livestock species affected by RVFV will be required to fully determine the basis of these efficacy differences and may inform development of vaccines to protect pregnant women against RVF.",17.002136287192005,10.612516041581655

At present, there are no licensed NiV vaccines for use in humans available. The existence of a NiV candidate vaccine should significantly reduce the risk of infection and transmission of the virus in the case of an outbreak scenario. There are some experimental NiV vaccines that have already been tested in different preclinical animal models. The major focus of these approaches was to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy in the context of NiV challenge infection. In those studies, efficacy has been mostly associated with the generation of NiV-specific antibodies, and immune monitoring is mainly relying on the detection of virus-neutralizing antibodies [31, 60, 61] . However, there is relatively little known about the induction and the relevance of NiV-specific cellular immune responses. In that context, the availability of appropriate tools to investigate the role of T cells in NiV-specific immunity is an important prerequisite in the development of new vaccines and therapeutics.

Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models. The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horseassociated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%).

Human picornaviral pathogens cause illnesses, which vary from the common cold to poliomyelitis. The picornavirus virion consists of an icosahedral capsid structure surrounding an RNA genome ranging from approximately 7 to 9 kb in size. Poliovirus and rhinovirus remain two of the most extensively studied picornaviruses to date and have become model systems for the study of RNA virus biology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology. During the 1950's, extensive efforts began to develop and implement a polio vaccine in the hopes to eradicate the virus since no non-human primate reservoirs are known to exist in nature. The effectiveness of the inactivated (Salk) vaccine and live-attenuated (Sabin) vaccines led to increased efforts to develop and design vaccines for many other human pathogens. International vaccination efforts are aimed at eradicating the disease. The success and employed strategies for implementation of vaccines for poliovirus opened the door to evaluating new approaches and efforts to study and understand RNA virus biology. A major step occurred in 1981 when Racaniello and Baltimore introduced a full-length cDNA clone of poliovirus into a cell and recovered infectious virus [2] . Although initially the mechanism by which a cDNA clone in a plasmid could give rise to productive RNA virus infection was unknown, the cDNA platform approach used by Racaniello [30, 31] .

In particular, the restriction of infectious NiV work to BSL-4 containment has hampered progress. Conventional clinical trials with viruses such as NiV are not practical. To address the development of countermeasures for exotic pathogens such as NiV the FDA implemented the Animal Efficacy Rule in 2002. This rule specifically applies to the development of countermeasures when human efficacy studies are not possible or ethical. Briefly, this rule permits the evaluation of vaccines or therapeutics using data generated from studies performed in animal models that faithfully recapitulate human disease. There are currently at least eight animal models for NiV including the IFNAR-KO mouse model [35] ; the guinea pig model [36] ; the pig model [8, [37] [38] [39] ; the cat model [10, 11] ; the golden Syrian hamster model [7, [40] [41] [42] ; the ferret model [30, 43] ; and two nonhuman primate models, one in squirrel monkeys [44] and the other in African green monkeys [32] .

For face validity there must be similarities in the pathology and clinical symptoms between the animal model and the human disease (56). As discussed above, NiV infection of pigs causes a similar respiratory and neurological syndrome as seen in human infections. Although, disease severity in pigs may be considered lower than in humans. The predictive validity of a model means that clinically effective interventions demonstrate a similar effect in the animal model (56) . No clinical trials of NiV vaccine candidates have been reported to compare with vaccine performance in animal models, including the pig. As noted above, the success of the Equivac R HeV vaccine in horses and other animal models was not replicated in swine (38, 39) , highlighting a potential issue of predicative validity when comparing NiV vaccines between animal species, which may extend to humans. On the other hand, pigs have been used successfully as models to study many human infectious diseases (57) (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) (63) , including NiV infection (64) . There is also a growing appreciation that pigs provide a superior animal model for influenza A virus infection and immunity and should play a more prominent role as a model for human influenza vaccine development (65) . The success of the pig as an experimental animal model is partly due to their similarities with humans in terms of anatomy, immunology, and physiology, but also due to their manageable behavior and size, and by the general ethical acceptance of using pigs for experimental purposes instead of non-human primates (55, 63, 66) .",19.136064019567456,10.25692017114991

Since the etiology of IC/BPS remains elusive and many factors appear to be causative for the disease, animal models with diverse pathological pathways have been developed [22] . It is now generally agreed that a valid IC/BPS animal model must present, at minimum, pelvic or bladder nociception and/or voiding dysfunction such as urinary frequency [22] . In this study we created a novel transgenic cystitis model (URO-MCP-1) that secretes MCP-1 by the bladder epithelium and develops bladder inflammation upon intravesical instillation of a single sub-noxious dose of LPS. Besides bladder histopathology, the URO-MCP-1 model demonstrates both qualitative and quantitative changes in bladder functions such as increased pelvic pain sensitivity, increased urinary frequency, reduced average volume voided per micturition (urgency), and reduced maximum volume voided per micturition (bladder capacity). Because of the genetic stability of the incorporated transgene, the URO-MCP-1 model is stable and reproducible and provides a unique translational model for IC/BPS research. URO-MCP-1 mice do not spontaneously develop bladder inflammation, pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction in the unmanipulated state, suggesting that the urothelial expression of MCP-1 alone is not sufficient to cause bladder inflammation and functional changes in these mice. However, URO-MCP-1 mice readily develop phenotypical and functional changes upon intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of LPS. Our observation is similar to those observed in other MCP-1 transgenic models. Gunn and associates reported that transgenic mice expressing MCP-1 by type II alveolar epithelial cells showed no morphologic evidence of inflammation in the lung but exhibited enhanced inflammatory response upon treatment with either intraperitoneal LPS or intravenous yeast wall glucan [7] . Huang and associates reported that transgenic mice expressing MCP-1 by astrocytes only manifested neurological impairment and encephalopathy after treatment with intravenous pertussis toxin plus subcutaneous complete Freund's adjuvant [8] . Similarly, Trujillo and associates reported that transgenic mice expressing MCP-1 by oligodendrocytes predisposed mice to a defective immune response to a minimally lethal neurotropic coronavirus and developed encephalitis following intracranial infection by the virus [9] . These observations indicated that development of inflammatory disorders is dependent on both genetic and environmental factors in the MCP-1 transgenic models.",21.127418195959013,13.645611721788473

In bacterial microbiome studies, a powerful approach has been the ability to colonize mice with either a single defined bacteria of interest or a consortia of bacteria. By analogy, it would be ideal if the virome could be functionally interrogated in similar fashion. However, a prerequisite for eukaryotic viruses is that one must first be able to establish infection in the relevant animal model. As with establishing cell-culture systems, the paucity of animal-infection models for novel viruses stems in part from lack of effort to develop such systems. Moreover, the challenge is exacerbated by the multitude of potential infection routes that need to be evaluated, need to overcome the immune response, cross-species transmission barriers, and (even within a species) potential impact of varying genetic backgrounds. Use of transgenic animals that are immunodeficient [26] or that have been partially humanized [27] has enabled development of murine models for some viruses. In an ideal world, animal models for all eukaryotic viruses identified in virome studies would be established, enabling the roles of any single virus (or cocktail of viruses) to be functionally evaluated. Likewise, having an extensive library of cultivated phages (see above) will allow them to be combined in defined proportions along with eukaryotic viruses for experimental studies. For phages, presuming they act by modulating the bacterial community, the animal model must harbor the relevant bacterial host species, and thus the bacterial microbiome may need to be manipulated as well. Notably, some recent studies have suggested that phages may also interact directly with eukaryotic host cells [28, 29] . Overall, significant effort and resources must be expended to establish robust animal-infection models suitable to define the role of the virome. This is a step that is absolutely necessary in order to move virome studies beyond the realm of mere association studies.",23.41899520421055,11.287291310155485

The evaluation of an antiviral, in the context of a host with a functioning immune system, enables better understanding of therapeutics' potential efficacy. The evaluation of an antiviral in the context of an impaired immune system enables better understanding of therapeutic use in a particular immunosuppressed population. Pathogen host range, especially if not a simple issue of receptor utilization, can confound the ability to interpret, and extrapolate to the human, some of the nuances of the host pathogen interaction and prediction of potential human therapeutic benefit. Of the small animal models used to evaluate antiviral efficacy, all have used stringent virus challenges (all greater than 10 √ó LD 50 ) and shown survival benefit. Routes of infection have used methods that attempt to simulate potential human routes of infection and resultant human illness courses. Given the uncertainties of what a human infectious or lethal monkeypox dose is, it is difficult to extrapolate the potential -best fit‚Äñ of any of these models for human disease. The clinical time course of disease in the prairie dog model, however, has a temporal relationship that is close to what has been described with human systemic orthopoxvirus (variola or monkeypox) disease. However, a limitation of the prairie dog and some of the other described animal systems, with the exception of the mouse model, is a paucity of immune reagents. There are a handful of antiviral compounds which show promise in these small animal models using monkeypox virus as the challenge. Additional studies evaluating treatment benefit when used in later stages of disease, their effect on elicitation of a protective immune response, evaluation of antiviral resistance, and their effect on viral shedding will improve our understanding of how they may be used in treatment of human disease, or in response to epidemic disease.",21.77264978902828,11.680083223641434

A very important question for understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection is what systems can be used for study. Early studies on SARS-CoV-2 determined that the cellular receptor for the virus is ACE2, similarly to SARS-CoV (3). This knowledge helps to develop an understanding of susceptibility of certain in vitro cell lines to infection with the novel virus. The likelihood is that if cells were not permissive for growth of SARS-CoV, they probably will not support growth of SARS-CoV-2. As more labs around the world start researching the new virus, a better understanding of the permissive cell lines will be developed, an important step to testing therapeutic options and developing a better understanding of basic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 virology. The more challenging aspect of lab-based research on the novel human coronavirus will be developing small-animal models. The early research on receptor usage suggests the virus is not able to infect cells expressing mouse ACE2 (3), thus making a mouse model potentially challenging. Whether expression of human ACE2 in mouse lungs using adenovirus or mouse adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 can develop appropriate models, as was done for SARS-CoV (18) , is a pressing question. Whether other small-animal models can be used also needs to be investigated.

However, the immunopathology seen in vaccinatedchallenged animals also occurred in animals given vaccine without alum. In an effort to determine whether an adjuvant that induced a bias for a Th1-type response would protect and prevent the immunopathology, we initiated an experiment where the DI PBS suspended vaccine was adjuvanted with Freund's complete adjuvant, a Th1-type adjuvant. However, this experiment was aborted by the September, 2008, Hurricane Ike induced flood of Galveston, Texas. An experiment with a SARS-CoV whole virus vaccine with and without GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) adjuvant ASO1 in hamsters has been reported [25] . This adjuvant is thought to induce Th1-type immune responses [49] . The authors indicate no lung immunopathology was seen among animals after challenge, including the group given vaccine without adjuvant; however, whether the hamster model could develop a Th2-type immunopathology is uncertain.

Thus, inactivated whole virus vaccines whether inactivated with formalin or beta propiolactone and whether given with our without alum adjuvant exhibited a Th2-type immunopathologic in lungs after challenge. As indicated, two reports attributed the immunopathology to presence of the N protein in the vaccine; however, we found the same immunopathologic reaction in animals given S protein vaccine only, although it appeared to be of lesser intensity.

The development of well characterized animal models of HTNV and PUUV infection is critical for the evaluation and the potential licensure of HFRS vaccines and therapeutics. In this study we present three animal models of HTNV infection (hamster, ferret and marmoset), and two animal models of PUUV infection (hamster, ferret). Infection of hamsters with a~3 times the infectious dose 99% (ID 99 ) of HTNV by the intramuscular and~1 ID 99 of HTNV by the intranasal route leads to a persistent asymptomatic infection, characterized by sporadic viremia and high levels of viral genome in the lung, brain and kidney. In contrast, infection of hamsters with~2 ID 99 of PUUV by the intramuscular or~1 ID 99 of PUUV by the intranasal route leads to seroconversion with no detectable viremia, and a transient detection of viral genome. Infection of ferrets with a high dose of either HTNV or PUUV by the intramuscular route leads to seroconversion and gradual weight loss, though kidney function remained unimpaired and serum viremia and viral dissemination to organs was not detected. In marmosets a 1,000 PFU HTNV intramuscular challenge led to robust seroconversion and neutralizing antibody production. Similarly to the ferret model of HTNV infection, no renal impairment, serum viremia or viral dissemination to organs was detected in marmosets.

The challenge after this sophisticated screening is the translation into drugs by clearing the phases of in vivo animal studies and human trials. A setback for the development of therapies against RSV is the lack of a good animal model as they do not truly manifest effects of RSV infection as in humans. RSV experiments in various animal models like BALB/c mice, cotton rats, macaques, African green monkeys, owl monkeys, cebus monkeys, bonnet monkeys, olive baboons, and chimpanzees are evident in the literature. Small animal models like BALB/c mice and cotton rats are commonly used due to ease of handling and low cost, whereas the primate studies are conducted with more stringent regulations and bear heavy expenses [210, 211] .

First, it is necessary to standardize protocols used to analyze the respiratory microbiome, including sampling, processing, and bioinformatics methodologies. For example, sputum may be an appropriate material for investigations of respiratory diseases since it contains components of the LRT and can be obtained easily. However, more reliable information on the LRT requires invasive samples such as BAL or protected specimen brush Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org or bronchial/lung biopsies. Second, most studies are limited to experiments conducted in animal models. Even in human studies, most analyses have been performed in a small number of patients and have described bacterial communities in the URT. The role of microbial communities outside of the lungs including gut, sinus, and skin should be considered in the context of airway diseases. Third, most studies on the microbiome have focused on the bacterial component, and have largely omitted fungi and viruses. The role of viruses-including the vast number of phages that infect bacteria-and fungi in respiratory diseases cannot be examined through 16S rRNA gene analyses, and there are no studies describing the composition and role of the respiratory virome due to the difficulty of comprehensive analyses for viruses. Fourth, it is not sufficient to study microbial communities based on species composition; a functional characterization through transcriptome and proteasome analyses is necessary to understand mechanistic role of microbiome on outcomes of infection. Finally, mucosal microbiome manipulations by vaccines, antibiotics, and probiotics in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract niches represent novel approaches for the prevention, treatment, and management of acute and chronic lung diseases. However, given that antibiotic therapy could affect commensal bacteria and hasten the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, more research is needed on the long-term effects of this therapy. Animal models should be developed to study the influence of the URT and LRT microbiomes on immune responses to respiratory viral infections; only then will it be possible to consider the clinical application of microbiome modulation strategies.",19.93339796465469,11.982504936661734

However, employing DNA as a basis for vaccination also implicates some disadvantages. A concern in this context is the long-term persistence of DNA plasmids upon injection. Indeed, DNA persistence was shown in various preclinical studies that demonstrated the presence of plasmid DNA for up to 2 years upon IM injection with low but detectable expression and immunogenicity in a mouse model (88) . According to the FDA, DNA persistence is not generally evident at ectopic sites in biodistribution and persistence studies, but remains detectable at the injection sites for periods exceeding 60 days 8 . Especially in the context of this long-term persistence, the presence of foreign genetic information in the nucleus of transfected cells poses the additional risk of genomic integration into the host's chromosomes and the resulting threat of mutagenesis and oncogenesis. Despite negative results in several studies focusing on detection of DNA integration events upon IM injection in small animal models, genomic integration events were detectable following electroporation in mice (89, 90) demonstrating that integration represents a small risk that nevertheless needs to be considered in systems with enhanced DNA uptake. The FDA recommends integration studies to be included whenever plasmid DNA exceeding 30,000 copies per ¬µg of host DNA persists in any tissue by study termination. The WHO advises integration studies as part of the preclinical safety program of DNA vaccines 9 . In addition, injection of bacterial DNA, sensed by the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs, has been associated with safety concerns, such as the generation of antibodies against the injected DNA. However, no anti-DNA antibodies have been detectable in mice, rats, rabbits or non-human primates (90) . Potential expression of the antibiotic resistance marker in vaccinated organisms has likewise raised safety concerns that are met by the replacement of these markers in next generation DNA vaccines. Lastly, expression of cytokines or co-stimulatory molecules that are used to enhance DNA immunogenicity might lead to unintended adverse effects upon cytokine expression and release such as generalized immune suppression, chronic inflammation or autoimmunity. The WHO recommends monitoring the persistence of a cytokine expressing plasmid as well as appropriate preclinical models, such as animal models responsive to the respective human cytokine to ensure vaccine safety.",14.99600853331949,8.434136540023713

Person-toperson spread occurs by large respiratory droplets or direct contact. 471 Most of the clinical features of human monkeypox are very similar to those of ordinary smallpox. 472 After a 7-to 21-day incubation period, the disease begins with fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, and cough. The main sign of the disease that distinguishes monkeypox from smallpox is swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), which is observed in most of the patients before the development of rash. 471, 473 Typical maculopapular rash follows the prodromal period generally lasting 1-3 days. The average size of the skin lesions is 0.5-1 cm, and the progress of lesions follows the order macules through papules, vesicles, pustules, umblication then scab and desquamation and lasts typically 2-4 weeks. Fatality rate is 10% among the unvaccinated population and death generally occurs during the second week of the disease. 469, 471 MPXV is highly pathogenic for a variety of laboratory animals, and so far, many animal models have been developed by using different species and different routes of exposure (Table 38. 3). Because of the unavailability of variola virus to develop animal models and resulting disease manifestations in humans that are similar, MPXV is one of the pox viruses that are used very heavily to develop a number of small animal models via different routes of exposure. Wild-derived inbred mouse, STAT1-deficient C57BL/6 mouse, prairie dogs, African dormice, ground squirrels are highly susceptible to MPXV by different exposure routes. [474] [475] [476] [477] [478] [479] [480] [481] CAST/EiJ mice, one of the 38 inbred mouse strains tested for susceptibility to MPXV, showed weight loss and dose-dependent mortality after intranasal exposure to MPXV. Studies with the intraperitoneal route of challenge indicated a higher susceptibility to MPXV with an almost 50-fold less LD50 when compared to the intranasal route. 474 SCID-BALB/c mice were also susceptible to the intraperitoneal challenge route, and the disease resulted in mortality day 9 postinfection. 476 Similarly C57BL/6 STAT1 √Ä/√Ä mice were infected intranasally with MPXV, and the infection resulted in weight loss and mortality 10 days postexposure. Mice models mentioned here are very promising for screening of therapeutics against pox viruses, but testing in additional models will be required for advanced development. High doses of MPXV by intraperitoneal or intranasal route caused 100% mortality in 6 days postexposure and 8 days postexposure, respectively, in ground squirrels. 480 The disease progressed very quickly, and most of the animals were lethargic and moribund by day 5 postexposure without any pox lesions or respiratory changes.

It represents the leading cause of non-traumatic disability among young adults and has a great socio-economic impact in developed countries. MS is a very heterogeneous disease, indeed its clinical signs and symptoms are very variable and depend on the parts of the affected CNS (brain and spinal cord), including motor, sensory, autonomic and cognitive disabilities (Noseworthy et al., 2000) . It can run at least three clinical courses: the relapsingremitting (RR), which is the most frequent (85%) and it is characterized by exacerbations and subsequent periods of clinical stability; secondary progressive (SP) and the primary-progressive (PP) subtype (Noseworthy et al., 2000) . CNS tissue from Multiple Sclerosis patients shows discrete lesions with inflammatory infiltrates, demyelination, astrogliosis and early axonal damage. MS is widely considered an autoimmune demyelinating disease, where an autoimmune reaction by myelin-specific CD4 √æ T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, which initiate the neuropathology, has been described (Hafler et al., 2005; Sospedra and Martin, 2005) . A specific cause for the pathogenesis of MS has not been identified so far, although several genetic and environmental risk factors have been suggested to play a central role. In this context, animal models of MS had allowed to explore mechanisms of disease initiation and progression and test several novel therapeutical approaches for the disease. the question whether these animal models could really represent a good model for MS since they do not perfectly reflect all the aspects of the human disease. In particular, disease initiation is usually highly artificial in the animal models (induced by active immunization with an auto-antigen). Also the time-frame of the clinical symptoms onset is different between humans and mice. In humans, physiological processes underlying the disease are undetected for years before the onset of clinical manifestations, while symptoms in the animal models can be detected within weeks or even days after induction of the disease. Moreover the treatment in these therapy studies started very early in the course of the induced autoimmune disease, whereas any therapy for humans is administered in a late phase of the disease. More importantly, most of the experimental studies use inbred strains mice with genetic homogeneity and often these mice may have accumulated genetic irregularities that are very difficult to find in human population. Although it has become clear that rodent and human immune systems have profound differences (as they are evolutionarily distant), they share some essential principles and, in this context, the availability of three major animal models of MS allowed the understanding of relevant features of the human MS. The most commonly studied animal models of MS are (1) the experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE); (2) viral induced models, mainly Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection and consequential chronic demyelination and (3) toxin-induced models of demyelination, such as the cuprizone and the lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lysolecithin) models.",18.841719417511605,11.410768352010562

Whilst it is sure that the vast majority of the animal models used in the laboratory are mice and rats because of well rehearsed arguments: they are small, easy to work with, inexpensive to keep, their generation time is short and they have large litters that can allow controlled breeding programmes, however, in part because of their short lifespan, murine models may fail to reproduce authentically the human diseases process. Therefore, longitudinal studies still need to be performed in large animal models. Dog, cat, sheep and, in general, large animal models have a longer lifespan, their physiological parameters, e.g. their immune system, and their size make them more similar to humans than the murine models. This does not address the question of ethics, and certainly not of cost. The use of larger animal models allows the disease states to be modelled more accurately than rodent models, some of these diseases are even naturally occurring e.g. gene therapy has been evaluated in the brains of cats affected with Œ±-mannosidosis (AMD) and the RPE65 ‚àí/‚àí dog suffers from early and severe visual impairment, similar to that seen in human Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA).

As mentioned earlier, there are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines. In addition, many technologies used (production platforms, vectors, etc.) are new and need to be tested thoroughly for safety. The target for the vaccine, the S protein, has been identified, and vaccine candidates are being generated. This is usually followed by two important steps that are typically needed before bringing a vaccine into clinical trials. First, the vaccine is tested in appropriate animal models to see whether it is protective. However, animal models for SARS-CoV-2 might be difficult to develop. The virus does not grow in wild-type mice and only induced mild disease in transgenic animals expressing human ACE2 (Bao et al., 2020) . Other potential animal models include ferrets and NHPs, for which pathogenicity studies are ongoing. Even in the absence of an animal model that replicates human disease, it is possible to evaluate the vaccine because serum from vaccinated animals can be tested in in vitro neutralization assays. Post-challenge safety data should also be collected in these cases to assess for complications such as the ones seen SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV vaccines. Second, vaccines need to be tested for toxicity in animals, e.g., in rabbits. Usually, viral challenge is not part of this process, because only the safety of the vaccine will be evaluated. This testing, which has to be performed in a manner compliant with GLP (Good Laboratory Practice), typically takes 3-6 months to complete. For some vaccine platforms, parts of the safety testing might be skipped if there is already sufficient data available for similar vaccines made in the same production process. Vaccines for human use are produced in processes that comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) to ensure constant quality and safety of vaccines. This requires dedicated facilities, trained personnel, proper documentation, and raw material that was produced to be of cGMP quality. These processes have to be designed or amended to fit SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. For many vaccine candidates in the preclinical phase, such processes do not yet exist and have to be developed from scratch.",22.82003490943682,14.034786032504243

Well-validated reagents are needed as reference standards for essential laboratory tests as polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, and PCR primer pairs.

The original provisional licensure was granted to provide possible protection against that single species of snake and was granted for use only in California. Recently, the company was granted extended provisional licensure for multiple states and has extended their claim for potential protection against multiple species of members of the Crotalidae (pit vipers). At this time, no challenge studies have been performed in the canine species to validate efficacy claims; all claims are based on antibody titer to the venom component included in the vaccine, to murid challenge studies, and to anecdotal reports of protection of naturally occurring envenomation [35] . The manufacturer does not claim that vaccination with this product completely protects against the effects of envenomation; rather, the manufacturer claims that it may slow the onset of clinical signs and decrease the severity of signs. Immediate veterinary care is still the ''gold standard'' for any snakebite. Because of the great potential for variability in envenomation (site of bite on an animal, size of the snake, amount of venom injected into an animal, and species of snake), field observations and anecdotal reports of protection are difficult to substantiate. Challenge studies done under controlled conditions are likely necessary to validate the efficacy of this product. At present, because of the preceding statements, this vaccine is not recommended for general use.

Animal models have been useful in studying individual pathways involved in pathogenesis and new ideas for treatment. No single animal model mimics all of the clinical features of ALI in humans, and each animal model has unique features that affect responses to treatment. Nevertheless, many themes have emerged from animal models that provide valuable insight about lung injury in humans. Studies of innate immunity have shown that innate immunity is triggered not only by microbial products but also by endogenous byproducts of tissue damage and inflammation that can drive inflammation even in the absence of microbial products in tissue. Variability in host innate immune responses accounts for a great deal of variability in the clinical manifestations of ALI. Innate immunity and mechanical stretch have important synergistic interactions in adults that accentuate ALI. These synergistic interactions seem to be acquired with age and are much less pronounced in juvenile animals. Apoptosis pathways are important in clearance of bacteria from the lungs, and also in causing injury and death to alveolar epithelial cells, enhancing permeability edema. Animal models have highlighted the complexity of ALI in humans, by showing the multiplicity of pathways activated by microbial products, mechanical stretch, and the combination. Analysis of protein networks has identified unexpected components that link key protein pathways in the lungs. New light has been shed on clinical risk factors for ALI, such as gastric aspiration, blood product transfusion, alcohol excess, and fever. Stem cell biology has been extended to ALI with the finding of unexpected paracrine effects of MSC in reducing the severity of ALI. New ideas about the resolution of ALI have derived from studies of the clearance of apoptotic cells in the lungs, and the role of regulatory lymphocytes in recovery from lung inflammation and injury. Progress is being made, but strong links between the laboratory and the critical care bedside are still needed to translate new ideas from laboratory studies into clinical treatments that will lessen the severity and improve the outcome from ALI.",18.060285949830302,12.954697480244866

The study of single and multiple gene knockout animals has provided new perspectives on T-cell development, costimulation, and activation. ""Humanized mice,"" transgenic severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID) mice grafted with human cells and tissues, enable research in regenerative medicine, infectious disease, cancer, and human hematopoiesis.

Engineered animal models are proving invaluable to pharmaceutical research since small animal models of disease may be created and validated to mimic a disease in human patients. Mouse, rat, and zebra fi sh are the most common models explored and used. Genetic engineering can predispose an animal to a particular disease under scrutiny, and the insertion of human genes into the animal can initiate the development of a more clinically relevant disease condition. In human clinical studies, assessments of effi cacy and safety often rely on measured effects for surrogate biomarkers and adverse event reporting. Validated transgenic animal models of human disease allow for parallel study and possible predictability prior to entering clinical trials. Also, it is possible to screen potential drug candidates in vivo against a human receptor target inserted into an animal model. The number of examples of transgenic animal models of human disease useful in drug discovery and development efforts is growing rapidly (Sharpless and DePinho 2006 ; Schultz et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2011b ; Clark and Pazdernik 2012b ) .

Essential components of refining toxicity and carcinogenesis studies include: (a) selection of animal models that can metabolize a chemical in a similar manner to humans, that are small enough to house in large numbers in a laboratory setting, that have a low prevalence of spontaneous lesions, and that have a long life span; (b) control of variables such as environmental conditions, diseases, and genetic characters of laboratory animals; (c) euthanasia of animals during the course of a study to alleviate pain and suffering, thus preventing development of secondary lesions and facilitating detection of chemical effects; and (d) limiting the duration of studies in rodents; which may decrease variability and complications due to nonneoplastic lesions and spontaneous tumors. All of these procedures will help to decrease the variability and increase the sensitivity--thus refining toxicity and carcinogenesis studies. Further refinements include the use of genetically engineered animal models such as transgenie mouse strains with known oncogenes to decrease the duration and increase the sensitivity of carcinogenesis studies with a decrease in the use of animals.",18.22409222386409,11.345430366712264

The ideal animal model for human viral disease should closely recapitulate the spectrum of clinical symptoms and pathogenesis observed during the course of human infection. Whenever feasible, the model should use the same virus and strain that infects humans. It is also preferable that the virus is a low passage clinical isolate thus animal passage or adaptation should be avoided if model species can be identified that are susceptible. Ideally, the experimental route of infection would mirror that occurs in natural disease. In order to understand the interplay and contribution of the immune system during infection, an immunocompetent animal should be used.

Well-characterized animal models are critical for licensure to satisfy FDA ""Animal rule."" This rule applies to situations in which vaccine and therapeutic efficacy cannot safely or ethically be tested in humans; thus licensure will come only after preclinical tests are performed in animal models.

However, development of live-attenuated virus vaccines for some human pathogens can encounter safety concerns due to under-attenuation of the virus or even a reversion to its pathogenic state. For example, in efforts to develop HIV vaccines, researchers have investigated live-attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccines as proof of principle and found strong levels of protection in nonhuman primates ( Johnson and Desrosiers, 1998 ) . Unfortunately, live-attenuated SIV vaccines can also cause AIDS in vaccinated monkeys due to reversion to pathogenic form ( Baba et al., 1999 ; Berkhout et al., 1999 ) , which is a frequent source of controversy for those in the field ( Murphey-Corb, 1997 ) . Similar findings are noted for other experimental live-attenuated vaccines. For example, live-attenuated dengue virus vaccines also show protective immunity in animal models ( Blaney et al., 2005 ) . However, a Phase I clinical trial involving a live-attenuated dengue virus vaccine formulation was halted due to side effects caused by under-attenuation of the vaccine virus strain ( Kitchener et al., 2006 ) .

Most models involve immunization of rodents with retinal antigens such as arrestin (S-antigen) or interphotoreceptor retinoidbinding protein (IRBP). In these models, elicitation of ocular pathology requires co-administration of adjuvants, the most common being bacterial fragments or pertissus toxin mixed in CFA. The goal in those models is to trigger pattern recognition receptors on innate immune cells, thereby promoting a pro-inflammatory environment in which there is an autoreactive component.

Moreover, the characteristics and conditions that make an antibody protective against EBOV in animal models and/or in humans are not fully understood. Furthermore, the protective ability of a specific mAb in one animal model does not necessarily imply that it provides protection in another animal model. Nacayama and Saijo (2013) have comprehensively reviewed the different animal models used to study EBOV infection, mainly rodents and non-human primates (NHP), and have summarized their strengths and weaknesses. NHP, particularly rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, better mimic EBOV infection in humans and more closely reproduce the symptoms of the disease than do rodents. However, the use of NHP presents researchers with more significant practical and ethical hurdles (Nacayama and Saijo, 2013; Geisbert et al., 2015) than does the use of rodents. Different rodent models have been developed to do EBOV research, including some knockout variants (Brannan et al., 2015) . The practicality of using rodents in the laboratory and the possibility of using genetically modified animals has made them an attractive model with which to study the protective effect of anti-EBOV therapies and vaccines. However, the EBOV has to be adapted to cause lethal infection in rodents, which represents a highly restrictive situation given the high risk presented by handling a BSL-4 pathogen, such as EBOV. Moreover, some widely used rodents, such as mice and guinea pigs, do not exhibit some of the distinctive symptoms of EBOV in primates, such as fever and rash, which further suggests dissimilarities between the anti-EBOV immune response in rodents and primates. In general, anti-EBOV protection in rodents is not a conclusive indicator of protection in humans. Probably the best example of this is the case of mAb KZ52, which is neutralizing and protective in rodents but not in NHPs. In the particular case of anti-EBOV mAb therapies, NHP studies appear to be a mandatory step in predicting efficacy in humans. However, no clear correlation can be established between therapeutic effectiveness in NHPs and humans due to the limited amount of clinical data in humans.",21.477422723866297,13.078258207831658

In addition, the program offers a transgenic mouse model of hamster-scrapie (see detailed descriptions of the models on the website referenced below). The NIAID contract laboratories are staffed by established investigators who possess a strong antiviral research background and publication record in their respective animal models.

There are two main forms of plague: the bubonic plague, resulting from transmission of the bacteria via the bite of an infected flea, and the pneumonic plague, which is caused by the subsequent spread of the bacteria to the lungs. The pneumonic plague is also transmissible from person to person via airbone transmission and is almost 100% fatal when left untreated. Although vaccines are useful in the prevention of infection by Y. pestis and a number of killed whole-cell (KWC) vaccines and a live attenuated vaccine (EV76) have been developed over the years, various shortcomings and drawbacks have limited their wide use in the prevention of plague in humans [1] [2] [3] [4] . Two Y. pestis proteins, fraction 1 capsular protein (F1) and LcrV (V) protein, are known to be protective antigens. In the last decade, subunit vaccines based on F1 and V recombinant proteins have been shown to be immunogenic and protective in various animal studies against plague challenges [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Subunit vaccines comprising recombinant F1 and V proteins have shown to be immunogenic in a phase I clinical trial but the levels of protective antibody responses are not impressive and may not persist for an extended period [14] . The search for additional protective antigens has only achieved limited progress. A third protective antigen, YscF, was recently reported in several independent studies but the level of protection was only partial when tested in lethal challenge studies in animal models [15] [16] [17] .",19.850849606440637,11.094353596613963

Samples taken from fatal human cases of SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections often do not represent the full range of the different temporal stages of a disease. Instead, they are more likely to represent late-stage disease. In addition, the lesions caused by the viral infection may be complicated by lesions caused by clinical treatments and concurrent preexisting disease. Therefore, to be able to study the course of the disease caused by these viruses, good animal models are necessary for SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections in man. Good animal models for SARS and influenza in man should ideally show virus replication dynamics, clinical illness and pathological changes that resemble those of human cases. The choice and design of an animal model used in an experiment is crucial for the outcome of the investigation and should be considered carefully. Time course experiments provide information about the temporal and spatial dynamics that help to design such animal models, including which time points and which samples are best to gain the most useful information (van den Brand et al., 2012a) . Not only the best time points and analyses of the most informative samples should be considered carefully, but also the animal species, the inoculation route and the age of the animals are important, as is shown by studies of H5N1 influenza in ferrets and of SARS in aged mice and macaques (Rockx et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2010; Bodewes et al., 2011) . Taken together, animal models should be designed specifically to address the aspect of SARS or influenza in man that one is interested in, since no one animal model can hope to address all the variation that is inherent in these viral diseases.",19.850405230276284,9.457259791049733

The ability of exposure to one human NoV strain to protect against infection with another, but only sometimes, also complicates modeling efforts. There are likely strain-to-strain differences in innate susceptibility and disease outcomes (disease severity) but these are also poorly characterized. In most instances, the inability to consider these factors in dose-response modeling means that current models tend to be more conservative (overestimate infection or disease risk) for normal, healthy individuals.

Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are born lissencephalic and undergo postnatal cortical folding to form complex gyrencephalic brains. This review examines whether ferrets might provide a novel intermediate animal model of neonatal brain disease that has the benefit of a gyrified, altricial brain in a small animal. It summarizes attributes of ferret brain growth and development that make it an appealing animal in which to model perinatal brain injury. We postulate that because of their innate characteristics, ferrets have great potential in neonatal neurodevelopmental studies.",24.124748759351384,12.849996287136051

However, there is a significant need to develop efficacious vaccines for several existing as well as emerging respiratory infectious diseases. Several challenges need to be overcome to develop efficacious vaccines with translational potential. This review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers -1) the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines, and 2) the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases that will allow for translation. Nanoparticle-based vaccines, including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers, as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development. These include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens, target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells, enable cross-protection against divergent strains, act as adjuvants or immunomodulators, allow for sustained release of antigen, enable single dose delivery, and potentially obviate the cold chain. While mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases, they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic. An overview of different animal models involved in vaccine research for respiratory infections, with advantages and disadvantages of each model, is discussed. Taken together, advances in nanotechnology, combined with the right animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy, has the potential to revolutionize vaccine development for respiratory infections.",20.984053210302772,12.016576602617505

This means acceptable formulations, solubility, stability, and pharmacokinetic parameters as well as tolerability in appropriate animal species. A dispersive development model is also necessary for moving these types of antivirals through development, especially animal efficacy testing (Figure 2) .

Taken together, these studies clearly validated the concept of using DNA vaccines for both protection and therapy against these protozoan parasites in a variety of mouse models. While sterile immunity seems to be an irrealistic goal for either Leishmania or T. cruzi, a reduction in disease severity and in the development of the pathology seems clearly within the reach of DNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the relevance of such mouse models for the development of veterinary or human vaccines against these parasites has been challenged by some authors. The few DNA vaccine studies in nonmurine models of leishmaniasis suggest that some extrapolation may be feasible, but certainly not completely. Additional advanced preclinical studies of DNA vaccine candidates in nonmurine animal models such as rats, hamsters, dogs, or monkeys are thus warranted in the next few years, to further explore the immunology and efficacy of DNA vaccines against these parasites. As already observed in such studies for other pathogens, this will lead to the challenge of achieving in these species an immunogenicity of comparable level and protective efficacy as that obtained in murine models. However, advances in adjuvants, DNA vaccine formulation, and delivery systems are likely to contribute to such results [1, 109] .",20.75762685394138,10.42722119579263

Evidence points toward bats as a natural reservoir of EBOV, but efforts are still underway to confirm and define the host and virus associations. Even with such information, it would be highly impractical to attempt vaccinating bats to prevent infection of humans and nonhuman primates because so little is known about the life cycles of the many different species of bats in EBOV endemic regions. Thus, the most likely targets of an EBOV vaccine are at risk laboratory workers and individuals in areas where an epidemic is occurring. In addition, because EBOV and related filoviruses are considered to be biological warfare or bioterrorism threats, efforts have been made to develop a vaccine that could be stockpiled for use in such events. An another vaccine target population is endangered great apes, which appear to be as susceptible to EBOV disease as humans. To date, several vaccine candidates against EBOV have shown promise in laboratory studies, although none have yet progressed toward licensure.

However, a commercial safe and efficacious vaccine for HIV-1 is still not available and is unlikely in the near future, despite exhaustive efforts in HIV-1 vaccine development that began 20 years ago immediately after the initial characterization of HIV-1. 566 Several serious issues that must be resolved for future vaccine success include identification of immune correlates of protection against either lentivirus infection or virus-associated disease. The apparent difficulty of addressing this question was predictable since virus elimination has not been observed during natural infection with immunodeficiency-inducing lentiviruses, even when strong virus-specific cellular and humoral immune responses have been detected in the infected host. Vaccine-induced protection against pathogenic challenge has been difficult to achieve in both the SIV and FIV animal models, and when observed, has been inconsistent. An additional complication is presented by the specter of vaccine-induced immune responses that prove detrimental rather than protective as reported for FIV and more recently in the SIV animal model. The complication of virus strain diversity has barely been addressed by vaccine design in animal models and surely poses a major complication for HIV-1 vaccine success in the future. Successful resolution of these obstacles in vaccine development, and most particularly the lack of understanding of why some vaccines such as attenuated viruses are sometimes protective, absolutely requires continued examination of viral pathogenesis and host immune responses in animal models including both nonhuman primate and nonprimate lentivirus animal models. Elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms used by these immunodeficiencyinducing lentiviruses during the earliest stages of virus exposure and virus-host interactions will be critical for design of vaccines that will have any potential for sterilizing immunity, if such a goal is possible. Similarly, a far more precise understanding of viral mechanisms for immunodeficiency will also be necessary for design of therapies of immune reconstitution in both acutely and chronically HIV-1-infected hosts, which can only be gained through experimental animal model studies.",24.129766477929582,11.535903804327509

For this, the immune system can be stimulated with either the weakened or killed pathogen or proteins/antigens from it, the so-called subunit vaccines (Fig. 1) . Subunit vaccines can be based on a single antigen or a mixture of antigens, which can be purified from the parasites or produced through recombinant DNA technology. The approach of producing a commercial vaccine straight from worm material is not applicable for most parasite species because it is practically difficult or even impossible to obtain large enough quantities of parasite material. For this reason, recombinant vaccines have been evaluated against a range of helminths. However, maintaining the correct conformation of target antigens in recombinant form is a major challenge, 3 and only a few recombinant vaccine antigens have been shown to be protective. The challenge for further development lies in delivering these promising subunit vaccines in a manner feasible for large-scale commercial production, testing their efficacy in more extensive field trials, and in making them fit for purpose for commercial and end-user uptake. 2 Despite strong efforts to develop antiparasitic vaccines, only 3 vaccines are currently on the market ( Table 1 for (Providean Hidatil EG95, Tecnovax) is available on the commercial market in parts of South America for the control of Echinococcus granulosus in sheep and goats.",18.65418869906532,11.020302449950114

Even when the pharmaceutical industry recognizes the market potential of a vaccine against an emerging pathogen, such as HIV or hepatitis C virus, there are many difficult steps between the desire to develop the vaccine and its availability for purchase. There are more steps from the discovery of a newly EID agent to the availability of a vaccine against it than for a pathogen that has been studied for decades or more than a century. First, the pathogen must be characterized at the levels of biology, molecular composition, and its genome. Even well into the contemporary molecular, proteomic, and genomic era, knowledge of the proteome and genetic sequence provides no more complete understanding of the agent than possession of an encyclopedia, which written in a language that has been translated only partly, would impart omniscience . Second, appropriate animal models that adequately mimic the pathology of the human disease, anatomic distribution of the agent, and the human immune response to the infection must be developed. There are numerous agents that are so highly adapted to humans that no adequate animal model exists. Other models utilize animal species that do not permit effective analysis of the protective immune response owing to lack of reagents to evaluate the immune cells and proteins and absence of animals that are genetically inbred or have knockout of specific genes. Third, studies of animal models and of humans and their cells, cytokines, and antibodies are employed to elucidate the mechanisms of protective immunity. Development of a vaccine that stimulates the presence of memory cells that generate the immune components required to kill the invading pathogen rapidly requires determining which elements (e.g., antibodies, CD4, and/or CD8 T lymphocytes) are critical. Fourth, the antigens of the particular infectious agent that stimulate the protective memory immune components must be identified. For subunit vaccines, some antigens stimulate protective responses, and others suppress protective immunity. Fifth, the animal models are utilized to develop and test vaccine candidates that stimulate protective memory immune responses without harmful side effects. At the point of the primary identification of the etiology of the emerging infection, it would be unlikely that any of these five steps would have been addressed.",22.785981548751536,12.937450526678363

Several animal models have been evaluated for SARS-and MERS CoVs including mouse, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, rabbits, rhesus macaques, marmosets, and cats. 42, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Early effort was directed in developing animal models for SARS-CoV, but the specificity of the virus to ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV) was a major hindrance to such efforts. Later, a SARS-CoV transgenic mouse model was developed by introducing hACE2 gene into the mouse genome. 51 The first animal model used for developing a MERS-CoV vaccine was rhesus macaques. Infected animals showed clinical symptoms such as increased body temperature, piloerection, cough, hunched posture, and reduced food intake. 52 Another frequently used animal model for MERS-CoV is the common marmoset, wherein the virus caused lethal pneumonia. 53 Humoral and cell-mediated immunity could be detected in both rhesus macaques and common marmoset following MERS-CoV immunization. 43 47 These hamsters are a potential model for studying CoV pathology and pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. The attenuated NSP16 CoV vaccine was studied in mice. 54 Attempts to develop animal models for MERS-CoV such as mice, hamsters, and ferrets face limitations due to the inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of these species. Small animals (mice or hamsters) resisting natural infection with MERS-CoVs (which are susceptible to SARS-CoV) have been genetically modified to a more humanized structure, e.g., hDPP4 human, hDPP4-transduced, and hDPP4-Tg mice (transgenic for expressing hDPP4), and ascertained for susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. 55 Alteration in the mouse genome using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool could make the animals susceptible to CoV infection and virus replication. 56 Genetic engineering was used in the generation of 288-330 +/+ MERS-CoV mouse model, which is being used for the evaluation of novel MERS-CoV vaccines and drugs. 57 Compared to the large animal models, small animals such as mice and rabbits are preferred due to lower cost, ease of manipulation, and readily available efficacy methods. 43 Further studies are needed to recognize suitable models for emerging SARS-CoV-2 by identifying receptor affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and studying disease manifestations, pathologies/viral pathogenesis associated with experimental inoculation of the virus in mice, rats, and other models, as well as examining virus-specific immune responses and protection.

Zika virus is a mosquito-vectored flavivirus responsible for periodic outbreaks of disease in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands dating back over 50 years. Over this period, ZIKV infections were subclinical in most infected individuals and resulted in mild cases of fever, arthralgia, and rash in others. Concerns about ZIKV changed over the past two years, however, as outbreaks in Brazil, Central American countries, and Caribbean islands revealed novel aspects of infection including vertical and sexual transmission modes. Cases have been reported showing dramatic neurological pathologies including microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental problems in babies born to ZIKV infected mothers, as well as an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. These findings prompted the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV a public health emergency in 2016, which resulted in expanded efforts to develop ZIKV vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Several ZIKV vaccine candidates that are immunogenic and effective at blocking ZIKV infection in animal models have since been developed, with some of these now being evaluated in the clinic.

Moreover, if wild models are to act as bridges between the laboratory and the real world, the ideal wild models should be associated with resources and tools that allow for molecular-level approaches to be applied in the field. Several groups of mammals squarely fit these criteria (e.g., wild rodents, wild primates). Mammalogists are thus uniquely positioned to spearhead efforts to develop new wild models for disease ecological research. Here, we focus on the ungulates as a mammalian group that has much to contribute to our understanding of infectious disease processes in the wild.",29.258931661095644,14.401135226643333

From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, this ongoing debate prompts even broader reflection about how studies of infectious diseases in laboratory and captive settings apply to natural populations in the real world. Unlike the laboratory, the real world is complex and most animals, including humans, interact with parasites and pathogens in this highly variable context. This reality has fueled ideas that ""wild"" animal models may be as important as laboratory models in the study of infectious disease processes (Wolfe et al. 1998; Pedersen and Babayan 2011) . Whereas laboratory animal models have paved the way toward advancing our understanding of disease processes occurring at the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels, the promise of wild models lies in their potential to help define how mechanisms revealed in the laboratory operate within the genetic, phenotypic, and environmental contexts that characterize natural populations. The use of wild models may also facilitate the inclusion of a more diverse set of organisms in infectious disease research, allowing for increasingly powerful comparative studies. However, the challenge is to find wild study systems that will balance realistic complexity with tractability and can thus serve as effective models for discovering how infectious disease processes function in nature.",24.938440863583992,14.086691950264651

Further, passive immunotherapy using convalescent phase human plasma is being considered in MERS patients after its success in animal models .

Although each model reviewed in this article has some utility in the study of SARS disease and prevention, the kinetics of viral replication and resolution of disease are much more rapid in animal models compared to human infections, and no model fully reflects the spectrum of clinical illness (morbidity and mortality), associated pathology, and viral replication observed in human cases of SARS.

As such, lymphatic drug transport cannot be studied directly in humans. Various animal models have therefore been described in an attempt to quantitate the contribution of the lymphatic system to overall drug absorption [62] . In the majority of cases these pre-clinical models collect the entire volume of lymph flowing through mesenteric or thoracic lymph duct cannulas and therefore provide an absolute indication of the extent of lymphatic transport. Other models have also examined the use of a lympho-venous shunt which has the advantage of allowing sampling of lymph over much longer periods, although in this case the relatively small database for lymph flow rates makes estimation of the absolute extent of lymphatic transport difficult [63] . The majority of lymphatic transport studies described in the literature have utilised rats [62] , reflecting the relative ease of sourcing and housing small laboratory animals, however, larger animal models such as dogs [11] [12] [13] , pigs [64] , sheep [65, 66] and rabbits [67] have also been described. The advantages of larger animal models include the capacity to dose more clinically relevant full-sized human dosage forms and the ability to administer compounds under more representative fed and fasted states (rodents do not eat on command). The gastrointestinal tract, transit profile and biliary secretion patterns of dogs and pigs are also more similar to that of humans when compared with rats (in which bile is continuously secreted into the intestine).

However, reports of immunopathologic reactions in older mice and in non-human primates vaccinated with SARS-CoV vaccines that were subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [57, 59, 62, 64] have revealed two concerns about proceeding to clinical trials with SARS-CoV vaccines. First, there is a precedent for coronavirus-vaccine associated disease enhancement; kittens immunized with a vaccinia virus vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus vaccines developed severe disease when they were subsequently infected with FIPV [65] . In these kittens, non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies facilitated viral entry into macrophages. The concern that is extrapolated from the FIPV vaccine experience to human SARS-CoV vaccines is whether vaccine recipients will develop more severe disease if they are exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV after neutralizing antibody titers decline. The second concern is whether recipients of a SARSCoV vaccine would be at risk of developing pulmonary immunopathology following infection with an unrelated human coronavirus e.g. 229E, OC43, HKU1 or NL63 that usually causes mild, self limited disease. Although findings from preclinical evaluation have revealed these concerns, studies in animal models may not be able to provide data to confirm or allay these concerns. Factors to consider when selecting an animal model. Animal models should be tailored to the goals of the study. If the primary goal is to elucidate pathogenesis, the model should replicate key aspects of the disease and immunological reagents should be available. The demographic background (e.g. age for SARS) of the animal should be taken into consideration. In contrast, animal models used in vaccine/antiviral efficacy studies must demonstrate meaningful differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated control groups. Special consideration should be given to how animals from different demographic backgrounds respond to the vaccine/antiviral under investigation. To determine the correlate of protection, it is necessary to study the immune response to the vaccine as well as the immune response elicited after challenge with the homologous coronavirus. It may be of interest to evaluate the response to challenge with other coronaviruses that the vaccinated host may encounter. Gretebeck Table 1 Coronaviruses associated with disease in humans.

Viral causes of gastroenteritis","The immense disease burden of viral gastroenteritis underscores the need for effective prevention strategies. Endemic rotavirus disease is clearly the most important target for prevention, and efforts to develop rotavirus vaccines were initiated many years ago when it became apparent that improvements in hygiene and sanitation were unlikely to interrupt viral transmission [Bresee, et al., 1999] , A vaccine against rotavirus was licensed for the first time in the United States in 1998 but was withdrawn a year later following strong suspicion and evidence of its association with intussusception [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999; Murphy, et al., 2001; Offit et al., Section II, Chapter 13 of this book]. Despite this setback, efforts to develop other candidate vaccines are underway, and products currently in clinical trials may be available for use in the next few years. The role of other viruses, including caliciviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses in the etiology of severe endemic gastroenteritis needs to be better defined to determine whether these viruses should be targeted for prevention through vaccination. For the prevention of epidemic viral gastroenteritis, efforts clearly need to be focused on caliciviruses. The epidemic spread of caliciviruses is facilitated by the low infectious dose (<100 viral particles), ability of the virus to survive at relatively high levels of chlorine and temperatures from freezing to 60¬∞C, great genetic diversity, and lack of lasting immunity [Kapikian, et al., 1996] . Efforts to prevent calicivirus outbreaks currently focus on identifying and eliminating sources of contamination of food and water. Person-to-person spread of caliciviruses can be reduced by good hygiene practices but is often difficult to interrupt; consequently, outbreaks spread by this mode in institutional settings (e.g., nursing homes) often run their natural course and terminate when susceptible persons are exhausted.",18.595561154300306,11.691765209699687

PMOs were designed to inhibit translation of EBOV VP35, VP24, and L transcripts . All three PMOs showed activity using an in vitro translation assay and reduced viral titer in cell culture. In a similar study, a different VP35-specific PMO also reduced virus yield in cell culture (Enterlein et al., 2006) . This PMO targeting VP35 was conjugated to an arginine-rich peptide (P-PMO), or left unconjugated, and tested in a mouse model of EBOV infection. Five hundred micrograms of VP35 PMO or P-PMO was delivered to mice by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) 24 h and 4 h before EBOV challenge. With this treatment regimen, VP35 PMO protected 75% of the mice from lethal infection, while 100% of the P-PMO-treated mice survived.

Importantly, a combination treatment of all three PMOs, given 24 h after EBOV infection, provided complete protection. Surviving mice developed an immune response to EBOV and were protected from subsequent challenge. In guinea pigs, maximum efficacy was seen when the combination treatment was given 96 h postchallenge, compared to treatment with a single PMO given closer to challenge; probably due to differences in pharmacokinetics and bioavailability between treatment regimens. Finally, anti-EBOV PMO treatment was investigated in rhesus macaques . Monkeys were administered a single PMO (VP35) or a combination of three PMOs (VP35, VP24 and L) from 2 days before, through 9 days after EBOV challenge by a combination of parenteral routes.

The clinical worsening of individuals with SARS in week 2 is apparently unrelated to uncontrolled SARS coronavirus replication but may be related to immunopathological damage. 55 A model taking into account the role of proinflammatory cytokines could help interpret this event ( figure 3 ). This view is derived from the effects of the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which shares with the SARS coronavirus the ability to cause a disease with similar histopathological features and symptomatology. 57 PRCV induces severe lung damage through immune-mediated mechanisms-ie, probably through an increase in the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF‚ê£ and interleukin 6, whose role in inducing lung damage has been proved using adenoviral vectors in animal models. 58 On these grounds, we think that the associations between TNF‚ê£ and interleukin 6 concentrations and disease severity should also be tested in stored samples from human patients with SARS. If confirmatory results are obtained, then, it would be reasonable to consider chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine to suppress TNF‚ê£ and interleukin 6 production. For this purpose, efforts to develop an animal model for SARS would be welcome.

Ideally an animal model should reproduce the hallmarks of human disease as closely as possible in an immunocompetent animal following a realistic dose of challenge virus via an appropriate inoculation route (Safronetz et al., 2013) . An important component of the FDA's Animal Rule, which concerns the approval of new drugs when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible, states that FDA will rely on evidence from animal studies if the animal models used are expected to react with a response predictive of humans or a single animal model is sufficiently characterized to predict the human response (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration, 2014).

Various mouse models are often used to establish first proof of concept for a new vaccine in vivo with regard to its safety and efficacy. Since pathogen-host interaction differs between mouse and human, careful selection of the pathogen for challenge experiments and the appropriate mouse strain (or an alternative animal model) is necessary in order to obtain relevant data. For example, in the case of efficacy testing of poxvirus vaccines, the most common challenge model uses the lab-adapted VACV strain Western Reserve in mice. Even though special safety equipment is demanded for work with ectromelia virus, however, as the natural mouse pathogen causing mousepox, this virus resembles much more the course of disease progression of a variola virus in humans than the Western Reserve strain. To define the best route of challenge, virus administration is also important. Besides footpad inoculation, intranasal infection appears to mimic a more natural route of poxvirus infection. Thus, this virusanimal model represents an optimal small animal model to study MVA and orthopoxvirus immunogenicity and vaccine success ). Other viruses, e.g., HIV, measles virus, and Ebola virus, cannot infect or replicate in mice due to strict host specificity. For such viruses, other target animals such as monkeys are needed. In the case of HIV, infection of macaques with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is still an important animal model for the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and the development of novel HIV vaccines. A natural SIV variant defective in the Nef gene function was found to induce protective immunity against an SIV challenge and thus can provide a valid tool to study the immune parameters that confer protection against the challenge virus (Daniel et al. 1992 ). However, due to ethical concerns and high costs, low numbers of animals can be used in experimental settings. An alternative attempt is made to develop new mouse strains transgenic for human components. For example, a mouse transgenic for the human SLAM receptor enabled measles virus infection and replication in otherwise resistant mice (Ohno et al. 2007 ). Additionally, immunogenic parameters that would also be representative for humans cannot always be found in animal models. Therefore, so-called humanized mice are developed which lack parts of their own immune system and thus can be reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells from which functional human immune cells can develop (Legrand et al. 2009 ). Similarly, humanized mice have been successfully tested in infection experiments using S. typhi, a bacterial pathogen that is exclusively restricted to humans (Song et al. 2010) . Although the procedure to humanize mice is experimentally still very challenging, it is reasonable to expect that this system will be more and more introduced into testing of vaccines and therapeutics for intended human use.",17.089521336472338,9.190099822253691

Further development of MERS-CoV and other CoV vaccines thus needs proactive collaborative efforts from researchers filling knowledge gaps, and market stakeholders providing funding for this costly process. The latter can be insufficient and/or unsustainable, therefore hindering development of even some promising candidates. In an initiative aiming at accelerating vaccine R&D process by providing sustained funding to be prepared for future epidemics, the World Economic Forum launched the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) [80] . CEPI is an international non-profit association aiming at removing barriers facing vaccine development for epidemic infections and getting ready for future epidemics, including MERS-CoV. However, we still face a number of challenges despite the fact that various promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidates are currently available. There is a lack of animal models mimicking the disease in humans in which vaccine platforms can be tested prior to human use. We need to take into account the populations to target with vaccination, with camels and camel handlers being the most relevant ones. The lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis and immune responses to the virus in humans and camels, which is crucial for vaccine development, also needs further investments. In addition, the longevity of immune responses post-vaccination has not been evaluated for vaccine candidates, which is important for the vaccination scheme development and for the choice of the best candidates for further development. Lastly, most of the vaccine candidates are developed against the highly variable spike protein and thus may not be able to provide protection against CoV strains evolving in the future. A more targeted vaccination approach aiming at conserved epitopes should be considered for the development of a more broadly-acting CoV vaccine. Given the propensity of CoVs to jump the species barrier, current efforts to develop a MERS-CoV vaccine may also be of benefit to prepare for potential novel CoVs that may emerge in the future.",17.05568852873525,11.240707627913935

Ten years of magnetofection-Progress and prospects ‚òÜ,"Nucleic acids carry the building plans of living systems. As such, they can be exploited to make cells produce a desired protein, or to shut down the expression of endogenous genes or even to repair defective genes. Hence, nucleic acids are unique substances for research and therapy. To exploit their potential, they need to be delivered into cells which can be a challenging task in many respects. During the last decade, nanomagnetic methods for delivering and targeting nucleic acids have been developed, methods which are often referred to as magnetofection. In this review we summarize the progress and achievements in this field of research. We discuss magnetic formulations of vectors for nucleic acid delivery and their characterization, mechanisms of magnetofection, and the application of magnetofection in viral and nonviral nucleic acid delivery in cell culture and in animal models. We summarize results that have been obtained with using magnetofection in basic research and in preclinical animal models.

Models that demonstrate these effects have been created in immature rabbits (Balakrishnan et al., 2013) , newborn kittens (Balasubramaniam and Del Bigio, 2006) , dogs (Ment et al., 1982) and rodents (Burd et al., 2012; Dean et al., 2015) . Small animal models have several advantages, especially rodents. Rodents have a relatively low cost of care and maintenance accompanied by an accelerated life cycle. Commercial dietary products and species-specific antibodies are readily available and methods of behavioral and electrophysiological testing are well established. Many genetically modified strains exist, and availability of a fully sequenced genome allows for development of therapeutic strategies with specific targeted pathways. Behavioral testing in rodents can include evaluation of motor control, coordination, learning, memory and sensorimotor gating as well as tests of braveness and social interaction (Kim et al., 2015; Ramani et al., 2013; Ten et al., 2004) . There are also drawbacks to the use of rodent models. The rodent brain is lissencephalic with a much smaller proportion of white matter than is present in humans (Zhang and Sejnowski, 2000) . The foci of neurogenesis and timing of myelination are different. These factors may be important when studying the effect of an early insult on later brain development. The rate of rodent maturation is quite accelerated relative to humans with each day of rat development corresponding to more than a week of human development (Clancy et al., 2001) . Despite this, the timing of the cellular response to injury appears to be similar in both species. Thus as brain injury unfolds over hours to days, the developmental context changes differentially in rodents compared to humans; for example, as injury evolves from P7 to P10 in a rat, this time frame would roughly span 32 weeks to term in a human infant. Since the cellular and regional vulnerability of brain varies by developmental stage, the effect of brain injury and its repair may be quite different in rodents than humans (Balasubramaniam and Del Bigio, 2006) . These important differences have limited the translation of therapeutic interventions to humans. Despite these shortcomings, these small animal models have formed the cornerstone of our current understanding of mechanisms of brain injury and the basics of neurodevelopmental pathways used to develop new therapies.",15.644241984800061,10.918067445000457

The ability to image apoptosis noninvasively in living cells and animal models of cancer can not only provide new insight into the biological basis of the disease but can also be used as a quantitative tool to screen and evaluate novel therapeutic strategies. Optical molecular imaging such as bioluminescence-based genetically engineered biosensors has been developed in our laboratory and exploited to study protease activity in animal models with a high signal to noise.

Rather, experimental infection of healthy adult human volunteers has provided much of our understanding regarding the biology of HRV infections, which are the respiratory viruses most commonly associated with pulmonary exacerbations. Initially, HRV challenge studies in healthy volunteers have been used to study and develop therapeutics for the common cold. In order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of virus induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD, and to develop agents to prevent and treat them, studies in which selected subject populations with asthma or COPD are challenged with a characterized virus strain have been more recently employed. By building on this experience, small controlled viral challenge interventional studies in asthma and COPD early in clinical development could help triage agents that have the potential to attenuate the manifestations of naturally-acquired HRV infections leading to disease exacerbations. This review will summarize common respiratory viruses, the role they play in acute exacerbations of airway diseases, and recent advances in HRV challenge studies with particular emphasis on those studies conducted in subjects with asthma and COPD.",30.59217795047645,15.033348088559702

Also, the chosen animal models will need to recapitulate human disease as closely as possible.

In addition, since animals such as mice do not naturally develop asthma or COPD, the underlying baseline inflammatory profile and the acute pathology that mice develop in response to viral challenge in these experimental models may not be completely reflective of human disease [104, 113] . This, coupled with the inability of these species to be naturally infected with HRVs and other human viral respiratory pathogens, the high titer of viral inoculum required for infection (generally 10 6 50% infectious dose in tissue culture [TCID 50 ] versus 5 to 10 TCID 50 in humans), and minimal replication of virus make these models less than ideal for studying virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD. Translation of observations from in vivo animal models to human disease with respect to assessing potential candidates for therapeutic intervention remains to be clinically validated.

We have set up essential collaborations with appropriate academic laboratories, federal officials, private facilities, and the Department of Defense to capture all the expertise required to study and test antivirals. In the case of smallpox, there are numerous surrogate animal models being studied across the United States, and elsewhere, and we have availed ourselves of as many of those animal models as possible to address potential FDA concerns. Also, access to certain viruses, such as variola virus, are highly restricted and work can only be done at limited sites under high level containment. In the case of variola virus, work can only be done in the BSL-4 laboratory at the CDC. Without all these collaborations, it would not have been possible to develop Funding all of these studies is very costly. To that end, we have sought and continue to seek grants and contracts to support development of our antiviral products.

This funding came from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Office of Biodefense Research Affairs (OBRA), and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Similar levels of funding will be necessary to develop each individual antiviral product. Good and iterative communication with regulatory agencies, who will help define the studies that will be integral parts of the IND and NDA applications, is important. Biological countermeasure development is a relatively new area, so SIGA has repeated discussions with the agencies in order to determine the best path forward.

Virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD are the result of a complex interaction of a multitude of variables making the development of agents to prevent or treat exacerbations a tremendous challenge. Variability arises from a number of factors that include the infecting virus (type of virus, particular strain, timing of infection, inoculum size), host-related factors (genetics, phenotype of asthma, prior infections and immune response/immunity, inherent microbial flora), host medical history (e.g. comorbidities, concomitant medications), and environmental conditions (e.g. aeroallergens). Due to the lack of an animal species that is naturally permissive for HRVs to use as a facile model system, coupled with the limitations associated with animal models of asthma and COPD, experimental infection studies in humans have been crucial to our understanding of the biology of HRV pathogenesis. The controlled nature of these HRV challenge studies helps to alleviate much of the variability associated with studying naturally occurring disease exacerbations. These experimental infection studies have focused on trying to understand the immunemediated inflammatory response (i.e. cytokines, chemokines, other mediators, cell types, and signaling pathways) to HRV infection in asthmatics and patients with COPD often by comparing the responses between healthy and affected populations, or the responses among patients with different severities of disease. In addition, although the development of GMP manufactured HRV challenge stocks is not trivial, experimental infection with serotypes of HRV other than HRV-16 or HRV-39 will be critical in determining if the results obtained with the isolates of HRV-16 and HRV-39 used most frequently can be extended to other serotypes such as those in the HRV-C group, which may be a relevant group for individuals with asthma [243] . Experimental challenge studies in subjects with specific and predefined clinical phenotypes associated with asthma or COPD may help to further elucidate potential different mechanisms of susceptibility associated with virusinduced exacerbations compared to a broader heterogeneous population.",21.03168801485368,11.488790192272305

Further, questions remain regarding the ability of animal models of disease to recapitulate human molecular pathogenesis or act as predictors of therapeutic efficacy. Thus, it is likely that medical countermeasure development for HCPs will rely on identifying therapeutic targets that are uniquely modulated during HCP infection. It is also appreciated that many cellular processes can be regulated independently of changes in transcription or translation through phosphorylation events. Cellular kinases, individually or collectively (the kinome), play critical roles in regulating complex biology, underlie various malignancies, and represent high-priority drug targets. The growing interest in kinases in both basic and translational research has driven efforts to develop technologies that enable characterization of phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction.

Since July 2003, when the SARS outbreak ended, only a few cases of communityacquired and laboratory-acquired infection have occurred. The presence of an animal reservoir in nature suggests that the risk of re-introduction of a SARS-like CoV into humans remains, and efforts to develop prevention strategies continue. Animal models are needed to effectively test prevention strategies. Several animal species, including inbred strains of mice, have been found to support viral replication in the absence of clinical illness [3] . However, an animal model that mimics the natural course of disease affords a more stringent test of potential interventions. In several case series of SARS patients advanced age was a risk factor for severe disease, requiring intensive care and ventilatory support, as well as increased mortality [4] [5] [6] .

However, it has become clear that information derived from studies in mice cannot always be easily translated into real clinical applications because of the species-specific differences in expression of many vascular targets [237] . Inconsistent recapitulation of the results from the murine models to human biology may have correlated with frequent lack of immediate success in translational clinical trials. The uncovered cross-species variation in expression or presentation of tumor markers, with PSMA [251] and TEM7 [12, 252] serving as examples, could perhaps account for the lack of efficacy. A mere difference in tissue site, level, or time of expression of a vascular protein between mice and men may partially explain why pro-drugs identified by using mice undergo unexpected localization in humans and, therefore, are inappropriate for liganddirected targeting.

However, the host does not acquire high-titered monoclonal or polyclonal rotavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies or adoptively transferred virus-specific CTLs at or before natural challenge with wild-type virus. Therefore, analyses of the immunological determinants of protection against challenge are best performed in an active immunization scheme. Unfortunately, studies of active immunization have not provided a clear picture of which immunological effector arms are protective against challenge. For example, studies in both calves and mice found that protection against disease induced by homologous host virus after active immunization occurred in the absence of challenge virus-specific neutralizing antibodies in either serum, feces, or intestinal washes (Bridger and Oldham, 1987; Woode et al., 1987; McNeal et al., 1992; Ward et al., 1992a) . Fecal antibodies may not accurately predict antibody responses in the small intestine. Alternatively, virus-specific CTLs (which were not measured in these studies) may play an important role in protection after active immunization.

Sequence comparison between the Candid 1 and virulent strains of JUNV have shown multiple mutations within NP, GP and L are associated with the vaccine strain, but their relative contributions to attenuation have not been determined.

Therefore, the development of an effective and safe vaccine would represent a major accomplishment, not only in West Africa but also in other geographic regions due to the risk of imported cases of LF posed by increased international travel.

First, the mechanism of neutralization by rNTD vaccination in mice is unknown and requires further investigation. For example, the nature of the neutralization antibodies detected by the pseudovirus neutralization assay and PRNT assay remains unclear. Second, pathological lesions and antigen expression indicated by IHC were detected after the mice challenged by MERS-CoV, although significant humoral and cellular immunity was elicited by the rNTD vaccination. Whether this was the result of a memory response need further study. Additionally, the limitations of the animal models restricted the assessment of the protective efficacy of rNTD vaccine in mice [37] . The MERS-CoV infection animal model used in this study was developed by transducing mice with an adenovirus vector expressing human DPP4 [31] . MERS-CoV infection in this model is highly dependent on the transduction of cells and the level of DPP4 expression from the adenovirus vector; therefore, the model may not reflect the natural disease process [38] . Additionally, the 5-day animal model imposed the limitation that the viral titer data could not be collected for further investigation of the immune system response following clearance of the virus after rNTD vaccination in the mice.

However, none of these treatment methodologies is curative, and many have a limited life span, such as interferon (IFN)-Œ≤ that induces neutralizing antibodies in some MS patients [1] , or cause serious side effects (progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy) such as monoclonal anti-very late antigen (VLA)-4 antibodies (natalizumab, Tysabri¬Æ) [2] and thus cause patients to drop out of clinical trials or stop taking the treatment. In addition, although many studies have dissected the intricate pathways involved in the aetiology, development, and pathogenesis of diseases such as MS, we still do not have a definitive understanding of how these diseases manifest and, indeed in the case of MS, whether it is a single disease or rather a spectrum of disorders with similar characteristics. Therefore, researchers have used animal models to aid our understanding of disease pathways, immune cell functions, and pathology. An example of the importance of animal models was the demonstration that CD4 T cells specific for a myelin epitope injected into na√Øve animals were sufficient to induce a central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease with CNS lesions similar to those observed in MS [3, 4] . In addition, these models are a useful preclinical aid to developing novel therapeutic agents. Many different animal models of neuroimmunological disorders have been developed over the last few decades with some success. However, it is important to understand the advantages and limitations of each model to ensure that the correct model is being used for the purpose of the study.",18.523267925779987,9.699860576143204

First of all, it is difficult to change roles, terms, and conditions. People are happy with their routines. Some people are making money with animal models; currently, animal production for experimental studies seems to be a treasured industry. Particularly, animal experiments may provide a legal sanctuary for pharmaceutical companies. In our opinion, pharmaceutical companies, by means of presenting experimental studies as scientific evidence, can find their way to escape from complaints. Moreover, it seems that only after having their money back and when plenty of patients have suffered from unexpected side effects (as evidenced in plenty of phase 4 studies) they will withdraw selling their products, while, unfortunately, most of them are not willing to compensate for their fault. Huge amounts of money and resources are wasted, and pharmaceutical companies are not those who missed their resources. Actually, by providing false scientific pieces of evidence using inappropriate animal models and selling their drugs, they usually have their money back before phase 3 and 4 studies reveal hazards and inefficacy of their products.

Plenty of treatment modalities were developed on the basis of animal experimentations. Meanwhile, there is an increasing number of failed clinical trials, particularly on chronic and complex diseases that biased from the results of studies on inappropriate animal models [4, 5] . It is time to ask whether animal models truly predict human health conditions. While validity and acceptability of current successful trials and guidelines are debated in the 21st century because they are not patient tailored, how could we rely on animal models as an appropriate predictor of human conditions? Simplifying a complex system is inevitable to study the basis of a complex phenomenon. However, simplified models do not reflect all the properties of complex systems [4, 6] . When an animal model is used as the basis of a clinical trial, it is needed to mimic the complex properties of the patients. Otherwise, animal models might be misleading; consequently, a large number of therapeutic modalities might have lost in translation [7] . This study was therefore undertaken to provide shreds of evidence against the validity of animal models. It has been systematically discussed why the authors believe that it is time to re-evaluate the validity of animal experimentations. Although plenty of state-of-the-art disease modeling techniques have been introduced recently, their acceptance and application in the medical science society are scarce; nevertheless validity of these modern modeling techniques needs further evaluation as well. There is a gap between bench and bedside that, unfortunately, has not been appropriately filled with the animal models. In our contribution, we want to provide relevant facts which clearly show that translational medicine and PPPM need accurate surrogate for misleading animal models in order to increase the level of the future healthcare. In this article, we review the knowledge on inappropriate modeling of chronic and complex disorders, which is very important point for the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine. The translation medicine in this point has to deal with this problem in order to support further and smooth development of PPPM. It is absolutely essential the experts in all fields of medicine, and beyond, are aware of the described problems. The predictions in PPPM and potential preventive actions may very well be compromised if inappropriate modeling is being widely used in numerous cases, let alone the creation of personalized models for an individual patient.

For example, in small animals such as rodents, nose drops may deposit to the entire respiratory tract, which would not be the case in humans. Balmelli and colleagues estimated that 30% of 20 ŒºL of vaccine given to mice as IN drops deposited into the lungs. 767 Many viruses and bacteria that infect humans do not grow well in animal models. For example, species-specific differences in the distribution of sialic acid receptors on cell surfaces is a crucial factor in tissue and host specificity of influenza A viruses, which limits the number of animal models suitable for influenza research. 768 Such species-specific differences can make it difficult to use animals to study attenuated live vaccines or vaccine vectors, as well as to challenge animals to assess protection.

However, does it mean that Alzheimer in Down syndrome is equal to Alzheimer in elderly?! Does an Alzheimer model, which was developed by means of applying a mitochondrial toxin to a rat, is a good representative of Alzheimer in a Nobel laureate? How could we compare cognitive impairment in animals and human beings? We have to change the names of our models. Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse model is not an Alzheimer model. It is nothing but three copies of amyloid precursor protein deposition in the brain of a mouse. Conclusively, targeting a single aspect of a multifactorial disease such as Alzheimer will not appropriately model such a multifactorial chronic complex disease. In fact, none of age, oxidative stress, education, and other responsible genes were reflected in APP models of Alzheimer.

Whereas vaccines or antivirals may be addressed in many models, pathogenesis is best evaluated in those animal models for which immunological tools and reagents are available for detailed analysis of the immune response to the vaccine. This includes inbred mice and rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. It may actually be worthwhile to enhance the virulence of a SARS-CoV isolate by serial passages in an animal model to produce a challenge virus stock for vaccine studies that would elicit more reproducible disease in the animals. If a highly virulent host-adapted virus were to become available, such as a mouse-adapted or a monkey-adapted SARS-CoV strain, demonstration of the capacity of vaccines to protect against challenge with these more virulent strains would provide an almost ideal animal model. Different models may also need to be employed to evaluate pathogenesis versus immunogenicity. For pathogenesis studies in animal models, mortality is not required as a readout. It would be ideal to develop animal models with comparable levels of mortality to that seen in humans (‚àº10% overall), including the increased mortality at increased age (‚àº50% > age 60). The optimal result would be to demonstrate efficacy of vaccines or antivirals in SARS-CoV animal models that mimic human morbidity and mortality and that show protection without vaccine-associated immunopathology.",37.360354537031554,16.21919769445213

However, outside Argentina, Candid1 has only IND status and studies addressing long-term immunity and safety have not been conducted. Moreover, Candid1 does not protect against LASV. Despite significant efforts dedicated to the development of LASV vaccines, not a single LASV vaccine candidate has entered a clinical trial although the MOPV/LASV reassortant ML29, as well as recombinant VSV and vaccinia virus expressing specific LASV antigens, has shown promising results (Falzarano and Feldmann 2013) . Specifically, ML29 exhibited good safety and efficacy profiles in animal models of LASV infection. However, the high prevalence of HIV within LASV endemic regions raises safety concerns about the use of VSV-or vaccinia-based platforms. Control of LASV infection seems to be mediated mainly by cellular immune responses, and significant titers of LASV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are usually observed only in patients who have clinically recovered (Jahrling and Peters 1984) .

One may pay particular attention to differences in how a pathogen is delivered in nature (i.e., mosquito, superficial dermis, salivary proteins) and how this may or may not translate depending on how we deliver in the context of vaccination (i.e., needle, intramuscular or subcutaneous, no salivary proteins). Note added after review: Back correlations between efficacious vaccines and mechanisms of protection should be carried out to derive correlates of protection. Alternative approaches using in vitro organoids and ex vivo studies should be used to supplement live animal models, although their role in supporting product development is uncertain. Several other parameters of animal models can be poorly reflective of the human infection and disease experience. For example, the time course of infection in animal models can be remarkably different from humans. Further, lethal challenge models (e.g., Nipah) do not provide endpoints suitable for translation to clinical trials. Model relevance was also discussed in the context of a Zika pregnancy model in immunocompetent mice, in which the infected dams did not get viremia and there was no detectable vertical transmission of virus, yet there was virtually 100% fetal demise. Monoclonal antibody blocking studies indicated that, despite the absence of productive infection, the pathology was apparently caused by virus, raising the possibility of fetal demise due to specific placental pathology [7] . There would be great value in developing high quality, standardized animal models and challenge strains of particular pathogens that are broadly accepted. Following Good Laboratory Practices within high bio-containment required for handling some pathogens is difficult and could impact countermeasure development efforts in these areas. Note added after review: Emphasis should be placed on working with biocontainment labs to get as close to GLP compliance as possible.

In the context of infectious diseases for which it is not feasible or ethical to perform clinical trials, animal studies play an additional role. Under the FDA's Animal Efficacy Rule (""Animal Rule"") therapeutics against rare, emerging, or virulent agents can achieve regulatory approval provided efficacy is demonstrated in two animal models (one of which must be a non-rodent species) that display clinical illness representative of human disease (46). The ideal animal model is permissive to infection and reproduces the clinical course and pathology observed in humans. An algorithm for the development of animal models is presented in Figure 1 . Small animal models offer several advantages over NHP's including availability of animals and species specific reagents, ease of handling, reduced cost, and the ability to use sufficient numbers for statistical analysis. Especially with coronaviruses, rodents vary in susceptibility and may be semi-permissive to infection and refractory to clinical disease (47) , even so, they can be used to screen countermeasures (48) (49) (50) (51) . Thus, to generate a rodent model that displays clinical disease it may be necessary to adapt the virus to enhance virulence for the rodent host or generate transgenic animals.

However, there is a significant need to develop efficacious vaccines for several existing as well as emerging respiratory infectious diseases. Several challenges need to be overcome to develop efficacious vaccines with translational potential. This review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers -1) the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines, and 2) the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases that will allow for translation. Nanoparticle-based vaccines, including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers, as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development. These include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens, target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells, enable cross-protection against divergent strains, act as adjuvants or immunomodulators, allow for sustained release of antigen, enable single dose delivery, and potentially obviate the cold chain. While mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases, they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic. An overview of different animal models involved in vaccine research for respiratory infections, with advantages and disadvantages of each model, are discussed. Taken together, advances in nanotechnology, combined with the right animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy, has the potential to revolutionize vaccine development for respiratory infections.",20.22141172992789,11.742113622801117

It is likely that to be successful such vaccines will have to comprise protective epitopes that are very similar to those in the virus. Since the majority of these are conformationally dependent, it is expected that peptide immunogens are less likely to achieve this. The use of envelope gp120 as a vaccine has met with poor success, most likely due to the lack of authentic conformation of the monomer. This outcome has been seen in the FIV system where the relatively poor efficacy of a purified gp120 vaccine was in contrast to the robust protection provided by the whole inactivated virus from which the purified preparation was derived. 27 The lack of efficacy of gp120 in animal models, however, does not appear to be a lesson that was heeded in the clinical development of an HIV vaccine, where gp120 was pursued at great cost as a prototypic HIV vaccine, as discussed above.",24.10483212391628,11.148091448267625

Especially, rhesus macaque presented anti-DENV immune responses including T-cell responses and showed lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, mild dehydration and mild rash. However, chimpanzee models do not show symptoms of DENV (Table 1). Studies on the number of DENV required to infect NHPs have estimated that 104-106 PFU of DENV are delivered by a mosquito bite, and subcutaneous inoculation of this titer could lead to sustainable viral replication [25]. However, NHPs have a limitation in that they do not present clinical symptoms [2627]. However, when DENV was administered at high concentration via the intravenous route, hemorrhage appeared 3 days after infection [28]. As DENV serotypes evoke cross-reactive antibody responses in humans, secondary DENV infection of NHPs also induces increased viremia due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [27], which was experimentally proven by the fact that injection of an anti DENV monoclonal antibody leads to a 3- to 100-fold increase in viremia in NHPs [29].

Previously, to examine the replication of SARS-CoV, various animal models were used which showed the symptoms of severe infection [43]. In contrast to SARS-CoV, no MERS-CoV pathogenesis was observed in small animals. Mice are not vulnerable to infection by MERS-coronavirus due to the non-compatibility of the DPP4 receptor [44]. As the entire genome of the 2019-novel coronavirus is more than 80% similar to the previous human SARS-like bat CoV, previously used animal models for SARS-CoV can be utilized to study the infectious pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The human ACE2 cell receptor is recognized by both SARS and Novel coronaviruses. Conclusively, TALEN or CRISPR-mediated genetically modified hamsters or other small animals can be utilized for the study of the pathogenicity of novel coronaviruses. SARS-CoV has been reported to replicate and cause severe disease in Rats (F344), where the sequence analysis revealed a mutation at spike glycoprotein [45].

MERS-CoV-infected macaques develop a nonfatal mild pneumonia. The absence of severe respiratory disease and kidney disease in these nonhuman primates makes it imperative that additional animal models be developed. Thus far, there have been no reports of successful infection of mice or ferrets, but infection of these animals may be initiated or enhanced if the receptor for the virus, human DPP4, is expressed in lieu of the mouse protein. Notably, similar efforts to introduce the human receptor for SARS-CoV resulted in a transgenic mouse that developed an overwhelming neuronal infection (19, 20). These mice were useful for studies of vaccines and antiviral therapies but not for studies of pathogenesis. As mice engineered to express human DPP4 are developed, it will be important to minimize the likelihood of brain infection by careful attention to tissue-specific expression.",20.113255723708953,10.589988095102637

In these studies, it was necessary to use a genetically adapted virus that has undergone numerous mutations to achieve virulence and lethality.

Currently, the ferret is thought to be the most suitable animal model for respiratory influenza virus infection56 since ferrets are physiologically susceptible to wild type influenza viruses due to a similar respiratory tract and are able to transmit the virus once infected. As mentioned previously, ferrets display similar clinical disease as humans following influenza infection which include fever, weight loss, and sneezing and these positive features have been well discussed previously2124263056. As well, the ferret has been shown to have similar features as human in regard to IFN pathway function and is potential model for the study of human IFN-gamma signalling2457. Although the ferret is an appropriate model, it is imperative to be mindful of the disparities between animal models and the nature human infection to have an accurate assessment of research findings especially from ferret-influenza studies. During experimental influenza infections in animal models, a specific and known amount of virus is administered to the animal in a controlled manor, usually by intranasal inoculation. Modeling the infectious behaviour of a virus is more predictable when the infection route and dose are controlled. This is in contrast to natural infection where humans are infected with an unknown amount of virus in an unknown route, which must be considered when extrapolating results from animal model studies. Most significantly, ferrets as well as other animal models used in influenza studies are typically ‚ÄòSpecific Pathogen Free' (SPF). In this case, the ferrets are determined to be influenza free prior to study initiation. Unlike humans who have been previously exposed to various subtypes of influenza viruses, ferrets used in influenza studies are completely na√Øve to the virus. The nuances of the immune response subsequent to multiple influenza infections, such as the phenomenon of original antigenic sin58, has only started to be elucidated in the ferret model53 and much work is still required to have a full understanding of the effect of sequential influenza infection on the specific immune response mounted. Furthermore, since the influenza virus is subject to both genetic shift and genetic drift35, the clinical manifestations of sequential virus infections by a virus that undergone multiple genetic drifts would differ from a response of a virus that had undergone a significant genetic shift as that of the H1N1 2009 pandemic variant.",20.73121082681183,13.031058483960404

This limited attention is understandable from both economic and technical perspectives.

As such, trials may require clinical endpoints such as severe disease outcomes (e.g. death) or endpoints, which may be challenging to measure. From an economic perspective, the epidemiology of the disease, rare and sporadic outbreaks that occur in regions with very weak purchasing power, offers comparatively little or no market incentives for industries to invest millions of dollars to develop products against EVD. This economic obstacle, however, has changed in recent years owing to the risk of importation of the virus, potential misuse of the virus in bioterrorism, frequent outbreaks and the need to protect specific risk groups including health professionals, aid workers and military personnel amongst others. These interests have led to the evaluation of several clinically approved drugs in animal models. For instance, activated protein C88 and inhibitors of factor VIIa89 have shown some promising results in controlling coagulation disorders in animal models. Similarly, an RNA-based treatment strategy, namely, the use of antisense oligonucleotides, has been shown to interfere with transcription and thus viral replication.90 In contrast ribavirin, a broad spectrum anti-viral agent against many hemorrhagic viruses, was shown to have no effect on EVD.91 Although some of these strategies are promising, there are still substantial scientific and pragmatic issues that require elucidation.",21.25287960081696,11.187746220214066

It is deemed a cost-effective investment in preventing losses and is considered one of the four priority areas in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015‚Äì2030 which has been endorsed by the third United Nations World Conference in Japan.4 Over the past few decades, emergency response efforts have evolved from a focus on top-down relief assistance to a more comprehensive strategy with a greater emphasis on community participation and pre-event preparedness for better risk management. This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities.5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay.6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical.7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death.8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events.9

During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2014‚Äì2016, thousands of people were infected and many of them died due to the viral infection [1]. EVD is generally considered as an endemic disease in Africa. However, its spread can be broadened through travel to all parts of the world. It is known to be transmitted from humans, bats, rodents, and chimpanzees to humans. Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family [2]. Ebola virus has a negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 different proteins and is surrounded by an envelope that contains the virally expressed glycoprotein (GP). There are five species of Ebola virus including, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, all of which were named after the places where they were first discovered [3]. Ebola virus GP is associated with viral attachment to the host cell receptor prior to viral entry into the cells [45]. To date, neutralizing antibodies targeting Ebola virus GP have been reported to be somewhat effective at reducing the severity of Ebola virus infection and disease progression in animal models and humans. For example, when Ebola virus-infected monkeys were treated within 24 hours following Ebola virus challenge with ZMAb (composed of three monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] against Ebola virus GP), all survived from Ebola virus infection, while all monkeys without ZMAb treatment died within five days of viral infection [67] Furthermore, ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) treatment is known to be effective at reducing mortality rates in patients infected with Ebola virus [8]. Despite the severity of Ebola virus infection, there are currently neither preventive vaccines nor therapeutic drugs readily available for use.

The National Partnership Agreement on Natural Disaster Resilience in Australia therefore emphasises the significance of involving multiple parties including individuals.41 Emergency response systems are often complex and adaptive. A highly participatory strategy would encourage individuals to take more responsibility, become less dependent on the government and leave more resources for others.42 Trust in the government is important given that it is most likely to play a coordinating role in emergency events.43 However, over-reliance on the government and professional workers could dampen household efforts for future disasters.44 A study of postearthquake survivors in China showed that high expectations of the public on the government are associated with high trust in the government, leading to increased complacency in individual efforts in preparedness.16 In China, governmental response to disasters from the military force has often been extraordinarily rapid and efficient. For example, an earthquake-relief headquarter was established by the army 18 min after the earthquake strike in Ya‚Äôan and 5000‚Äì6000 rescue workers were deployed on the same day but people need to realise that there is always a gap before the full functioning of external rescue assistance, a gap which needs to be filled by the survivors of disasters.7 Poor cooperation from those being rescued can also jeopardise professional efforts.",7.4940753318129865,6.459441125198266

Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms can potentially improve both patient care and public health responses. An example of such an early warning system is the PRESAGED (Presymptomatic Agent Exposure Detection) system [1] which uses host-based physiological signals to detect an individual's exposure to pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, before overt symptoms emerge and infectiousness is peak. In animal models, the PRESAGED algorithm has been shown to provide two to three days of early warning before the onset of incipient symptoms (e.g., fever), independent of the particular pathogen, exposure route, pathogen dose, or animal species [1] . These results are consistent with findings of Speranza et al. that show presymptomatic upregulation in biomarkers potentially linked to pathogen exposure around the same time in non-human primates exposed to Ebola [2] . Numerous efforts have evaluated epidemiological models to characterize the disease transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of public health interventions of past outbreaks [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , including effort by Chowell et al [14] that examines the impact of a hypothetical early diagnostic capability (based on advancements in bioassay tests) for containing the spread of Ebola.

Bushmeat consumption and animal trading, arising from the growing demand of animal protein, causes significant changes at the human-animal reservoir interface (7). Among the BPDs, studies demonstrate that the SARS and EVD outbreaks were directly linked to the consumption of infected bushmeat (8, 9) . LF, MVD and EVD flourish in West and central Africa where the consumption of bushmeat is four times greater than the Amazon, which is richer in biodiversity (10) . Moreover, EIDs are also triggered by anthropogenic pressures on land use for agricultural expansion and livestock farming to meet the demand of a growing human population. The fruit-bat migration driven by the deforestation through forest fires in the islands of Sumatra lead to the emergence of Nipah disease in farmers and abattoir workers in Malaysia (11, 12) . Once sufficient infection cycles between human-animal without the sustainable transmission among humans termed as viral chatter is established, the emergence of human-tohuman transmission is inevitable (7). Mathematical modeling and prediction provides quick assessment for control and potential preventive efforts when time for epidemiological studies is scarce (13) . Modeling of infection dynamics analyses diseases outbreaks in animal population and estimates the rate of transmission as well as the potential chance of spillover. Yet, the increasing trends of EIDs risks surpass our capacity in the surveillance and detection of spillovers and outbreaks. Thus, the current public health response to EIDs is to ""get ahead of the curve"" and the growing resolution of satellite imagery has shifted the paradigm towards identifying potential environmental drivers such as deforestation, land fragmentation, biodiversity loss and climate change rather than the surveillance of the EIDs themselves.",12.39576217683267,9.056394292943072

Population models are central to our efforts to assess the numerical and ecological status of species and threats posed by climate change. Models, however, are crude caricatures of complex ecological systems. So how do we construct reliable assessment models able to capture processes essential to predicating the impacts of global change on population viability without getting tied up in their vast complexities? We broach this question and demonstrate how models focusing at the level of the individual (i.e., agent-based models) are tools for developing robust, narratives to augment narratives arising purely from empirical data sources and experimental outcomes. We do this in the context of nesting social groups, foraging for food, while exhibiting territoriality and group-switching behavior; and, we evaluate the impact of disease on the viability of such populations. 7 laboratory at the microcosm scale [7], but for populations of most vertebrates such 8 microcosm studies are not applicable, and we need to resort to the mesocosm level [8] or 9 use alternative methods to obtain insights.

Several mechanisms have linked the mechanical load to this biological response, including oxidative stress and MAPK activation (29) . Our work focused on the role of the nuclear envelope as a critical structure regulating both mechanosensing and senescence. The mechanical load is transmitted from the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton and then to the nuclear membrane (30) .

In this paper, we make the first step towards this objective. Due to lack of time and unreliability of available data on COVID-19, most of our results serve as an illustration of the role of different control options and we hope that even as illustration they are useful. However, we try to stay close to the COVID-19 epidemic scenario and hence we use appropriate recommendations about the choice of parameters and models of the virus behaviour we found from the studies based on the use of standard models.",8.1022953693777,4.1869998382179325

The aim of this project is to concentrate community modeling efforts to create a comprehensive multiscale simulation framework that can subsequently be calibrated, validated, and used to rapidly explore and optimize therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. Once the prototype has been completed (after several design iterations), this coalition will transition to maintain and support the simulation framework and aggregate calibrated/validated parameter values.",8.636642415355706,3.9537573150405008
