This review, and other individual reports [43] suggest that quarantine measures are most effective when mobilized at the very start of the outbreak when numbers are small. While decision-makers must rely heavily on simulation studies, a persistent concern raised [33] is that results are driven by prior assumptions; which may be unrealistic. Simulations rely on some degree of simplification such as considering only point-source outbreaks in non-overlapping populations. More sophisticated models incorporate heterogeneity in parameters including variations in size and behaviour of human contact networks, differences in transmissibility due to the host, and levels of adherence with control measures, such that scenarios simulated reflect what happens in real-world experiences [4, 33, 44, 45] . Simulation studies, typically, do not present impact statistics familiar to health policy makers, and may not provide evidence as compelling to decision-makers as real world outbreak experiences.

In the case of infectious diseases, we may be able to identify those at increased risk of contracting or transmitting infection, or those more or less likely to respond to interventions, before we have safe and effective interventions to offer, or before policy can be modified. Another major ethical challenge results from the variability in the predictive value of genotypic information and how such information can be used to inform risk management policy when our understanding of risk is inexact. The significance of genomic information, and the uses to which it is put, may give rise to the following specific ELSI-related concerns: (1) an imbalance in health-related benefits and harms to individuals and populations; (2) privacy and confidentiality of personal information, autonomy, choice and limitations on liberty; (3) the social and behavioral impact of genomic information on individuals, family members and others; and (4) the equitable distribution of scarce resources. Although these issues are not unique to infectious diseases, they need to be considered as our scientific understanding of the role of genomics in infectious disease management advances.

As reflected by our selected methods, throughput was an essential consideration. According to our assessment, the complete data package can be compiled within 2 business days, due in large part to the automation of our platform methods (multiplex SPR array, tip column-based walk away serum purification, and liquid-handling HDX reaction control), minimizing the need for extensive manual work. Furthermore, with the implementation of in-house MS software programs for automating the HDX data analysis (beyond the scope of this paper), the entire workflow process can be efficiently executed and can support additional iterations if necessary. As shown in Tables 4 and 5 , we used the QAR workflow to guide the development of therapeutic anti-BAFF antibodies, and we demonstrated that the data package contributed to the successful retrieval of functional anti-BAFF antibodies in a timely manner. We focused on the identification of immunized animals that produced high affinity antibodies that targeted well defined epitopes for use in hybridoma fusions. The comprehensive data package generated again confirmed that our methods can provide clear differentiation among the antibody responses in various animals.

A more proactive approach to surveillance would facilitate the precursory development of vaccines or other treatments, highlight potential transmission routes and reservoir species to efficiently isolate disease spread after an initial epidemic, and aid in classification of sentinel species used to monitor outbreaks of zoonotic diseases before appearance in human populations. A shift towards proactive surveillance and early detection necessitates baseline documentation of the variety and nature of multi-host animal parasites, including knowledge of contemporary infectious diseases of wildlife and domesticated animals, and an understanding of the ecology of these parasites and their known hosts. Identifying factors that promote parasite expansion, either geographically, in abundance, or in host range, will help prioritize the monitoring of these parasites and further development of proactive control and management programs.",23.420552117074532,10.732938253736249

Mitigation objective In Stage I, the level of risk must be perceived to be acceptable by decision-makers. The ideal risk would be zero, but in its absence an acceptable level of risk is generally defined as a situation for which no special intervention activities need to be directed at the pathogen [7] . The acceptable status may be a historically free status, freedom from disease, freedom from infection, or contamination of food products maintained below a defined threshold. Policy makers also may be aware of certain endemic pathogens, but categorise them as low priority and therefore do not tackle them. In short, the Stage I mitigation objective is to sustain the acceptable status. Additionally, compliance with international regulations to document disease freedom may facilitate access to foreign markets. B. Surveillance and intervention Surveillance information is used to document that a pathogen is not present or only in less than a specified proportion of the population, that an endemic status remains stable and to give an early warning signal if the situation is altered. Even though intervention measures are generally not needed in this stage, they are anticipated to combat a pathogen quickly when it occurs and are usually laid down in national contingency plans or equivalent regulations. If surveillance gives an alarm, response interventions will be implemented to contain the disease and prevent further spread (e.g. outbreak control). In such cases, the free status may be (temporarily) suspended until response activities effectively contain the disease.

Because movement of animals between locations is a key risk factor for many infectious diseases, many countries now implement mandatory animal traceability programs (23) (24) (25) (26) . For example, national or multinational programs, such as the European Union's Trade Control and Expert System and the United Kingdom's Cattle Tracing System, track shipments of production animals across space and time, generating a rich source of information for rapid response to health threats (27) (28) (29) . In the absence of national regulatory frameworks, large production companies often keep records on the movement of animals between company farms (30) . Movement data from a single swine production company in the US contained information on the origin and destination of 9.1 million pigs annually, totaling ~25,000 per day. Such databases can be used to construct contact networks that represent potential transmission pathways in a population, and social network analysis can be used to quantify the connectivity of each node within the network and to assess the population's vulnerability to infectious disease epidemics (26, (31) (32) (33) . Identifying premises that likely play critical roles in disease spread, such as highly connected farms or farms lying on bottlenecks within the network, can inform control measures that are more effective at limiting disease spread than non-targeted approaches (10, 21, 25) .

Traditional disease surveillance lacks the timeliness required for rapid detection of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Current public health systems rely on validated data from sources health systems, such as hospital and laboratory data, which are important for analysing trends over time, but do not meet rapid epidemic intelligence needs for early detection of epidemics (Yan et al. 2017 ). Epidemics, defined by a reproductive number greater than one (MacIntyre and Bui 2017), grow exponentially, so every day of delay in detection could substantially increase the morbidity and mortality burden. Mathematical models, typically of the form of deterministic systems of nonlinear differential equations, are often used to gain insight into the transmission dynamics and impact of natural and unnatural emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that threaten health security, such as disease pandemics (Nuno et al. 2007; Nuño et al. 2008; Sharomi et al. 2011 ) and the deliberate release of agents of bioterrorism, such as anthrax (Brookmeyer and Blades 2003; Mushayabasa 2016; Pantha et al. 2016 ) and smallpox (Banks and Castillo-Chavez 2003; Del Valle et al. 2005; Kaplan et al. 2003; Meltzer et al. 2001 ). These models, combined with robust health data analytics, computational and data visualisation techniques and numerical simulations provide a realistic, rapid real-time assessment of threats to public health security. Furthermore, informing these models with data generated from modern diagnostic tools that are capable of detecting asymptomatic cases with high degree of sensitivity and specificity (such as peptide-based immune-signaturing or low-cost paper-based RNA sequencing) (Legutki et al. 2014; Navalkar et al. 2014; Pardee et al. 2016; Stafford et al. 2014) , and using knowledge of prior bioterrorism attacks and natural disease outbreaks allow for a realistic proactive prediction of future threats before they are detected by the public health system. These approaches allow for a more proactive disease surveillance for human diseases as well as veterinary surveillance for zoonotic pathogens that can mutate and cause major burden in human populations. Other modelling paradigms, such as agents-based and other datadriven statistical and stochastic modelling approaches (Halloran et al. 2002; Hu et al. 2014; Kaplan et al. 2003; Nuño et al. 2008) , are also being used for this purpose. A stochastic approach to risk analysis allows model inputs to exhibit a degree of uncertainty. In contrast to deterministic models, the inputs follow various forms of probability distributions. Risk is computed by sampling these input distributions many times. Therefore, the outcome of a stochastic risk model is a distribution of risk-rather than a single value. The key advantage is that in addition to analysing outcomes, it allows for an analysis of the probability of these outcomes. It also allows for easy scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis. These can all assist decision-makers in taking intervention measures and allocating resources. One such example is a stochastic risk model (Hill et al. 2015) of zoonotic and pandemic influenzas, with a focus on human infection with avian influenza. However, there are few real-time models with applicability in operational public health, with most modelling occurring in academia without real-time applicability for disease control . End-users in the public health system do not have much knowledge or nor trust in modelling, and do not use it widely for disease control (Muscatello et al. 2017) . Availability of simple, transparent tools that can assist with pressing questions such as surge capacity planning during the influenza season is what stakeholders value (Muscatello et al. 2017) .",20.80278630311625,9.929659683896778

A first step to study this important question is to measure and compare the expression level of mRNAs. Several Chinese groups had developed algorithms for microarray experiments including designing probes [92] , processing raw data by an integrated pipeline [93] , detecting differentially expressed genes by relative entropy [94] , identifying clusters of coexpressed genes by Hidden Markov Models [47] , and finding disease-related genes by an ensemble decision approach [95] . Transcription factors bind to upstream regions of genes to regulate their transcription. About 2,000 transcription factors (,10% of the genomes) were identified in each of the three sequenced plant genomes, Arabidopsis, rice, and populus, by combining similarity and motif-based approaches [96] [97] [98] . A new method was developed to identify potential transcription factor binding sites in the upstream regions of genes by searching for overrepresented cis-elements with Position Weight Matrix-based similarity scores [48] . Another method uncovered the patterns of conservation, genomic distribution, and co-factor binding of transcription factor binding sites given ChIP-chip tiling array data [99] . A new fourcomponent statistical model was proposed to improve accuracy of the identification of translation initiation sites in microbial genomes [100] . Alternative splicing adds great variety to the proteome. A new method, named Splicing Variant Analysis Platform (SVAP, http://svap.cbi.pku.edu. cn), could identify alternatively spliced isoforms from EST data ten times faster than other existing methods. Increased prediction accuracy of splice sites was achieved by using quadratic discriminant analysis with diversity measure or by introducing a competition mechanism of splice sites selection [22, 101] . The impact of very short alternative splicing on protein structures and functions was studied [21] . An interesting work identified 2,695 newly evolved exons in rodents and calculated the new exon origination rate at about 2.71610 23 per gene per million years; they suggested that most new exons might originate through ''exonization'' of intronic sequences and appear to be alternative exons that are expressed at low levels [102] .",19.136043084294272,9.448017184357578

Molecular characterization is completely lacking. As with other livestock species, names ascribed to camel populations in Ethiopia usually reflect the area where they are kept or the tribe/clan who keeps them rather than their distinct attributes in terms of phenotype, genetic makeup and/or performance potential. A breed is defined as a population or group of animals having common origin and similar identifying characteristics that distinguish them from another population of the same species. It refers to a race of animals within a species that tend to transmit those identifying characteristics with reasonable consistency. Tezera and Belay (2002) identified two types of camels, the Agoweyn and Ayuune, reared by the Somali pastoralists based on physical attributes (body size, coat colour), production performance (milk, lactation length, loading and speed, breeding), physiology and behaviour (ability to withstand water deprivation, disease tolerance, feeding behaviour) and geographic distribution.

Firstly, emerging viruses are everyone's problem: the ease with which viruses can disperse, potentially worldwide within days, coupled with the very wide geographical distribution of emergence events [9] , means that a coordinated, global surveillance network is essential if we are to ensure rapid detection of novel viruses. This immediately highlights the enormous national and regional differences in detection capacity, with the vast majority of suitable facilities located in Europe or North America. Secondly, reporting of unusual disease events is patchy, even once detected, reflecting both governance issues and lack of incentives [10] .

However, these costs were offset after treating 26 patients, mainly due to reduced LOS and lower complication rates. The long-term model showed that the intervention is both more effective (2.4 month) and leads to lower costs to society (cost savings of £899.6/patient). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is £-4,015.9, meaning the new pathway is the dominant strategy and should be recommended to decision makers.

End-user physicians (neurosurgeons, operating room surgeons and anesthesiologists), the critical care unit resource nurse, and the most entitled service (trauma program) all identified circumstances in which they might make independent bed allocation decisions. This may explain why some end-user physicians experienced frustration in their attempts to access critical care unit resources. While official accountability for bed allocation decisions rested with the critical care physician, ""parallel track"" decision makers could allocate beds without this participant's knowledge. Previous investigators have demonstrated that parallel track decision makers may view the critical care unit physician as responsible for making decisions about the appropriateness of discharges, but may not consult with them about decisions to admit patients [10] . This exclusion from the decision making process may cause the official gatekeeper to be unable to explain why beds are not available in the critical care unit at a given time. When ICU beds are readily available, decision makers find it difficult to deny patient access to a bed-the "" non triage mode"". When there is a high census or full occupancy, decision makers must prioritize admissions to the ICU-""triage mode"". Involvement of the ICU physician in triage mode involves reviewing and prioritizing proposed admissions and decision making about discharges of patients who can safely be discharged or transferred.

The threat of an emerging public health event is especially burdening for the executive branch of the local state. Decision-makers are pressured to act early, at best before the expected cascading of an infection gets out of control. This expectation makes it tempting to base a decision on the syndromic signals as they are readily available and -through the included mapping tool -often clearly localized. While those signals are explicitly handled as an additional but clearly undiagnosed source of information among epidemiologists and public health experts, for the executive branch they have a tempting appeal of providing a near real-time situational awareness and as such an actionable grasp on the emerging public health event. Importantly, using ESSENCE as a base for decision-making approaches the signal as if it was an authoritative medical fact instead of just an indicator for the clustering of certain syndromes. The danger of misinterpretation as the algorithmically generated knowledge travels contexts may result in wrongly employed public health interventions with negative social effects.

However, if the virus mutates and achieves the ability to cause severe illness, it will kill more people and overwhelm the health system. Vaccination is the most effective means of pandemic mitigation. Vaccine production is a complex multi-step process which involves development, manufacturing, and delivery processes and current levels of vaccine production capacity are inadequate. Thus many uncertainties exist in every step and effective vaccines are typically available well after the viral strain has emerged [5] [6] [7] [8] . For instance, vaccines against the H1N1 strain are still under development and will remain in short supply by November 2009 [9] . Current stockpiling of antiviral drugs will also be in short supply and their efficiency will be limited once a pandemic occurs [7, 8] . Public health systems need to be prepared for cases when effective pharmaceutical interventions are unavailable. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are necessary to delay and dampen the pandemic before pharmaceuticals become available [7] . Recommended NPIs include: (1) social distancing: school closure, workplace distancing, restricted public gathering and travel;",24.746710816712234,12.516902174444862

Because NPIs disrupt daily societal functions, it is important that they be implemented judiciously. This requires identifying effective initiating triggers, which is a challenging research task. Implementing NPIs will impede influenza spread; on the other hand, normal societal functions will be interrupted. The optimal control method takes both aspects into account and tries to find the best balance between them, given the decision makers relative weighting of the two. Based on Figures 2 and 3 , early implementation for moderate and severe pandemic is very important for NPIs to have impact on the outbreak and the impact is effective only if NPIs are implemented early. Late NPI implementation might still be optimal, but the impact is much less. For a severe pandemic, it is optimal to trigger NPIs at the beginning stage when susceptible population is large and infectious population is small. If we miss the beginning stage, it is not optimal to implement NPIs until the outbreak is significantly progressed. This is because once the pathogen achieves a certain level of infection, NPIs are not effective against it, and thus are not worth the cost. That is, the benefit of NPIs at a stage when the disease has progressed significantly is less than the cost of NPI implementation. This finding supports the CDC pandemic mitigation guidelines, which state that when the pandemic is Category 4 or 5, all NPIs are recommended for early implementation [7] . Furthermore, earlier NPI implementation reduces and delays the peak of the outbreak as illustrated Figures 3(a) and 3(b), which allows additional time for vaccine development. If a severe pandemic occurs, hospitals will experience an overwhelming influx of patients and need to operate at their surge capacities. Earlier NPI implementation can reduce the magnitude of infectious at the peak, which relieves some of the burden on hospitals and other health care infrastructures. In contrast, NPIs are not nearly as effective if disease has already spread into the community as the cases shown in Figures 3(c) and 3 (d). In both cases, NPIs are triggered after the peak of the outbreak, where hospitals might have already been operating at their surge capacities for a few weeks. Both cases start at states falling on the control thresholds recommended in Figures 2(c) and 2(d) [37] . This finding indicates that the additional complexity of our model is warranted when compared with the SI model used in [37] . Timely and sensitive surveillance systems are key to successful application of the optimal control method as knowledge of both the pathogen characteristics and the community state are assumed. The surveillance systems should be able to identify the virus quickly and provide accurate estimates for parameters which characterize the severity of an influenza. The effectiveness of the control policy depends on the accuracy of these estimates, which include infection rate b, death rate τ and recovery rate g. Once the control policy is computed, we also need to track the community state to determine if NPIs should be triggered. As early NPI implementation is found to be much more effective, we do not want to miss the beginning stage of the outbreak. Thus, the surveillance system should also estimate the community state, including the size of the infectious and susceptible populations.",21.169057952426602,12.130237759621892

Participants also highlighted that challenges to the beef industry in Alberta have made raising beef cattle less economically viable and that BSE in Canada has placed producers under considerable strain: producers fear not only a reportable or notifiable disease but the stigma that would come along with being 'the guy in the community that's got a positive'. Participants believed that producers were bearing much of the cost of surveillance and had yet to realize the benefits of surveillance programs initiated in part in response to the BSE crisis. These circumstances remain an ongoing challenge to surveillance: the negative consequences of an EID or reportable or notifiable disease are more tangible than the purported benefits associated with robust surveillance initiatives [36] . As surveillance serves the interests of producers, the foodproducing industry, consumers, and the public [44] , distributing the economic burden of surveillance among these parties is warranted.

Although not routinely done, proactive and stable funding for these and other scientific inquiries provides opportunities to increase the knowledge-base from which decision-makers can draw when considering appropriate infection control actions, a suggestion supported by several scientific organizations. For example, longer-term studies, such as those on New World hantaviruses, have produced a great deal of information relevant to public health [82] , including changing infection prevalence with species richness [83] , the preponderance of infected males [84] , and the role of climatic changes in causing fluctuations in rodent reservoir populations and their links to localized, sporadic disease outbreaks. Although these studies were initiated as part of a reactive response to an acute outbreak-in this case, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome-in 1993-1994, the information produced addresses key knowledge gaps that can inform future outbreaks. Similarly, research supported during and after EVD outbreaks has generated data on wildlife reservoir hosts and people's perceptions of health and healthcare practices, both of which could inform future outbreak assessments and response efforts. In addition, funders should establish a process through which the results and assessments can be communicated to public health decision-makers, leveraging the recent movement towards open access publication requirements. As a positive example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and The Wellcome Trust require all grantees to make their results publicly available, enabling access to various stakeholders, including decision-makers [85] [86] [87] .

Whatever scientific information is shared with decision-makers before, during, and after public health emergencies is highly dependent on the individuals or organizations who are communicating with policy-makers. This article briefly describes the landscape of stakeholders involved in information-sharing before and during emergencies. We identify critical gaps in translation of scientific expertise and results, and biosafety and biosecurity measures to public health policy and practice with a focus on One Health and zoonotic diseases. Finally, we conclude by exploring ways of improving communication and funding, both of which help to address the identified gaps.

However, given the extensive distribution of pathogens [15, 67, 111] , some of which are not yet known or fully described, and the variety of animal species involved, effective surveillance and control of IDs constitute a significant public health challenge, and also predicting zoonotic emerging disease events remains a subject requiring persistent scientific exploration.",24.119032510546315,13.012838312933457

Secondly, precise health-related poverty alleviation approaches were performed at the county, family and individual levels with a focus on the most serious regions, targeted populations, and key diseases, aiming at integrating prevention with treatment by financial assistance through the poverty alleviation programme. Thirdly, detail objectives were identified to ensure [15] .

Fourthly, the three-pronged approaches were implemented by the following steps: (i) reviewing the epidemic trend and financial burden of the diseases among the poor population through a digital information platform; (ii) classifying the poor populations by disease, treatment service and financial protection needed; and (iii) identifying the most important diseases by population and geographical region by mapping for better targeting of medical care services and financial assistance (Fig. 3) . In addition, a three-years implementation plan on health-related poverty alleviation between 2018 and 2020 was implemented by the National Health Commission aiming to prioritize eradication of iodine deficiency, skeletal fluorosis and arsenic poisoning caused by coal burning and upgrade disease control with special reference to Kaschin-Beck and Keshan disease, as well as eliminate schistosomiasis as public health problem and effectively control echinococcosis in western China.

After all, disease dynamics are, in essence, dependent on human behaviour dynamics: people interact and take preventive measures on a regularly basis. Because there is much heterogeneity in the ways in which behaviour is included and parametrized in BCMs, it seems the real question is: 'How should behaviour be taken into account?' We found that model output may depend on the model specification, to the extent that the selection and development of a model leads in a predictive way towards a predefined conclusion. That is, it seems many of these models serve to justify a theory. For instance, in many pure game-theoretic models, free-rider behaviour emerges resulting in suboptimal vaccination coverage levels, whereas in models including imitation behaviour, the results are often ambiguous. Validation of models with real-life observations is desperately needed to specify an appropriate model, conditional on disease characteristics. Note that model selection implicitly determines the characterization of individuals in the population; models with an economic objective function often assume rational decision-makers, whereas models with imitation or information spread introduce some 'irrational' behaviour such as peer influence and social responsibility. Primary sources such as surveys are needed to empirically underpin the foundations of the models used. The study of Skea et al. [192] on MMR vaccination decisions uses an online chat forum to assess vaccination sentiments and the importance of social responsibility in the parental decision process. The authors find that: 'participants expressed a desire to both (i) protect their own child and (ii) help protect others by contributing to herd immunity' [192] . This finding suggests that people are not purely selfinterested and herd immunity is not taken as a means to opt for free-riding, on the contrary, establishing herd immunity is seen as an additional incentive, protecting others. A similar conclusion can be drawn from Vietri et al. [9] , who tested whether college students consider either freeriding or altruistic motives to decide on (not) receiving vaccinations. They find that individuals both incorporate their own risk of infection and altruistic motives in their decision of whether or not to vaccinate. Determann et al. [193] suggest that these behaviours-and as a result the decision-making process-are country-dependent. They find that focus group participants tend to 'base their vaccination decision on the trade-off between perceived benefits and barriers of the vaccine. . .'. Although, in their vaccination strategy, Swedish participants also incorporate: following the rules, doing the right thing, solidarity with other citizens and social influences. The latter drivers are less important in Dutch and Polish participants. This implies that studies may have to be diversified by country-specific characteristics to tackle the inhabitant's behaviour.

These results provide a crude ordering of infectious diseases that can be used to guide policy, planning, and research. Although data limitations preclude a greater level of precision and quantification of uncertainty, these results provide a sense of the relative importance of the infectious diseases studied. Less important than the precise position on the list is the fact that the top 20 agents capture such a large proportion of the total burden and that some recent high profile infections are absent. The next step is to translate these findings into information that is tailored for local decision-making. The WHO GBD project has had significant impacts on global and regional agencies, but a provincial analysis such as ONBOIDS provides information closer to the level of government responsible for healthcare policy-setting and funding. However, these findings are likely generalizable to other high-income settings. In translating findings such as these into policy, decision-makers must appreciate the ''herd-dynamic'' aspects of infectious diseases, such that, for example, funding for highly successful vaccination programs is not diverted towards the high-impact diseases identified here. The communicable nature of vaccine-preventable diseases means that ongoing investment is necessary to maintain existing successes. Also, while novel interventions (e.g., new vaccines) are required to further reduce the burden of infectious diseases, much of the burden can already be reduced by improved implementation of existing interventions (e.g., hand hygiene, improved vaccine uptake, safe injection sites). Setting priorities requires knowledge of disease burden as well as critical evaluation of the feasibility, cost, and impact of available interventions, and knowledge translation for decision-makers.

The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the existing economic evaluation literature in this area and to offer advice on how future evaluations on this topic should be conducted. Methods: We searched the Scopus database for all literature on economic evaluation of mask or respirator use to control respiratory infection transmission. Reference lists from the identified studies were also manually searched. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria from the initial 806 studies identified by the search strategy and our manual search. Results: Five studies considered interventions for seasonal and/or pandemic influenza, with one also considering SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The other two studies focussed on tuberculosis transmission control interventions. The settings and methodologies of the studies varied greatly. No low-middle income settings were identified. Only one of the reviewed studies cited clinical evidence to inform their mask/respirator intervention effectiveness parameters. Mask and respirator interventions were generally reported by the study authors to be cost saving or cost-effective when compared to no intervention or other control measures, however the evaluations had important limitations. Conclusions: Given the large cost differential between masks and respirators, there is a need for more comprehensive economic evaluations to compare the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in situations and settings where alternative options are potentially applicable. There are at present insufficient well conducted cost-effectiveness studies to inform decision-makers on the value for money of alternative mask/respirator options.",26.73460455916813,12.240577374536514

Combating NTDs and EIDs in many cases can be effective at primary healthcare and district healthcare facilities. Dr. Mwelecele Malecela, Director WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, has just made such a case at the global conference on mycetoma in Sudan, February 2019, stating that, ""An essential first step could be to look at how we can integrate mycetoma interventions within primary health care delivery"" [51] .

This would imply active involvement of politicians and governments and investment in universal health coverage [39] . Yet, as was argued by the panellists in Oslo, while neglect is a political issue (neglect of the underserved people that are particularly affected by both NTDs and EIDs), technical discussions or philanthropic efforts, though absolutely necessary and valuable, may divert our attention from the role of politicians, governments and responsible decision-makers [42] .

Public support for unpalatable measures is more likely if citizens understand the issues, and policy implementation reflects community values and preferences. To this end, citizens' juries have been employed in the UK, Australia, the US and elsewhere [69] [70] [71] [72] to explore similar issues and identify citizens' preferences. They represent informed public opinion better than other social research methods (e.g. surveys or focus groups) because they give participants factual information, bring them into a structured and constructive dialogue with experts, provide them with time to reflect and deliberate, and allow them to represent their views directly to policymakers. To be successful, One Health needs to be about more than disease prevention and control. The dynamic, unpredictable effects and risks to peoples' lives of EIDs necessitate a public health and biosecurity infrastructure equipped to address the ethical problems that arise. EID management must therefore be based on normative principles as well as local knowledge, operational experience and disease-specific scientific and economic evidence. This means that governments and policy-makers need to explain and justify the values that underlie decision-making and engage the public in discussions about ethical choices, so that when difficult decisions arise in the face of uncertainty, they will be accepted as fair and essential for the public good [47] .

This concerned optimal levels of pre-emptive culling of livestock on farms in the neighbourhood of a FMD case, where 'optimal' implies minimizing the total number of farms lost over the course of an epidemic. The analysis identified a conflict between local and global optima. Using parameter values consistent with the UK 2001 FMD epidemic, the globally optimal culling rate is almost four times as high as the local optimum; this reflects the need to reduce the likelihood of disease spreading from one local cluster to others. From a local perspective, this level of culling might well be regarded as 'overkill', 'draconian' or 'disproportionate' (all terms that were used during 2001), but the local perspective is not the most relevant one for decision makers. Another result was to illustrate that under-control is more dangerous than over-control, ultimately leading to more farms lost (the gradient of the curves are much steeper to the left of the optima than to the right). This result is quite general: if control measures are inadequate then an epidemic will not be brought under control and more of the population will be affected in the long run. If, as will often be the case in practice, there is uncertainty about the optimal level of control effort then it will often be preferable to err towards too much rather than too little.",20.596371834483367,8.007117551815824

For example, the Critical Response Time (CRT or time available to implement effective epidemic control measures) should be considered in decision-making [1, 5] . That is so because for any intervention to be very effective (≈ 100%), it must be deployed under a realist timeframe; if it requires a longer period of time, it will necessarily be (i) less effective (if not ineffective), and (ii) more expensive [5] . CRT may or may not include geo-referenced data. When it lacks geographical data, it becomes much shorter, making useless almost any intervention. Thus, the real significance of CRT is that it should be expanded (giving decision-makers more time to complete interventions) − which can only be achieved when high-resolution geo-referenced epidemiologic data are analyzed in time and space. Thus, to achieve improved epidemic control measures, geographically explicit data should be collected from epidemics, analysed and lessons learnt made available for future interventions. Only such (local or regional) data can support scientifically valid decision-making. Yet, even recent epidemics have been addressed with ad hoc policies, such as the classic '3-km radius control rings' -which assume all epidemics (ie, all pathogens, all host species, and all local geographies) are identical [1] [2] [3] .

The design of the multiplex amplification strategy is a time consuming effort. The current system remains somewhat vulnerable to the rapid mutation of RNA viruses and each new resequencing array design that increases the number of pathogens would require recalibrating the multiplex primers mix. One solution that already mitigates this is the grouping of pathogens into subsets for amplifications that are recombined for chip analysis. In the future, the more variable pathogens can be partitioned into their own mix so that the performance for the conserved pathogens i.e. bacteria are not affected when primers are changed and only mixes that have targets added to them require recalibration. Simplified redesign and alternative amplification methods that provide the necessary sensitivity with more comprehensive coverage are also currently being investigated. Despite these limitations, the positive results of this study lead us to believe the resequencing microarray is an excellent candidate for the next generation pathogen detection tools and provide a modern, broad-spectrum infectious disease surveillance solution for critical decision makers, including healthcare providers, patients, public health authorities, and framers of biosecurity policy.

They argue that unrestricted open access and free use or reuse of relevant and appropriate data together with sharing of data among African researchers, international partners, policy makers and the community will help limit the effect of burden of infectious disease epidemics in Africa. Availability of real time information on virtually all aspects of infections and diseases is required for timely action and response needed to ensure that public health events do not escalate to international concerns with grave consequences. It must be however observed that unrestricted free open access to data may lead to users being overwhelmed and unable to make sense out of the data, unless there is available capacity and capability for appropriately analysing and synthesizing the data into valuable information for policy-makers, implementers, care providers, researchers, health-related institutions and stakeholders including the community.

Dengue became a nationally notifiable disease in the US in 2009 because of concerns about the increasing number of importations and the consequent risk for local transmission and transfusion transmission [176] . During the Key West outbreaks, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) used all means available to reduce the populations of Ae. aegypti. Response strategies in Key West included public meetings and communication, education at schools, and tourism council press releases [42] . Tourism, public health, and vector control officials collaborated in response. Health department personnel conducted outreach visits to clinicians. Vector control activities include spraying adulticides within a 200 m radius around homes of casepatients, outdoor residual and spatial insecticide treatments, door-to-door campaigns to educate the public, and finding and eliminating mosquito breeding sites [42] . Florida law mandates inspections and the elimination of breeding sites; however, fines are not usually imposed and violations are frequent [42] . Since the implementation of response strategies, autochthonous dengue infections still occur in Key West, and a 2012 survey of the decision makers involved in the control of the outbreak revealed the need to focus prevention strategies on educational campaigns [177] .",23.595273036201853,11.091108352396905

With novel emerging infectious diseases being reported across different parts of the world, there is a need to build systems that can track, monitor and report such events in a timely manner. Further, it is also important to identify susceptible geographic regions and populations where emerging diseases may have a significant impact. Methods: In this paper, we present an overview of Oak Ridge Biosurveillance Toolkit (ORBiT), which we have developed specifically to address data analytic challenges in the realm of public health surveillance. In particular, ORBiT provides an extensible environment to pull together diverse, large-scale datasets and analyze them to identify spatial and temporal patterns for various biosurveillance-related tasks. Results: We demonstrate the utility of ORBiT in automatically extracting a small number of spatial and temporal patterns during the 2009-2010 pandemic H1N1 flu season using claims data. These patterns provide quantitative insights into the dynamics of how the pandemic flu spread across different parts of the country. We discovered that the claims data exhibits multi-scale patterns from which we could identify a small number of states in the United States (US) that act as ""bridge regions"" contributing to one or more specific influenza spread patterns. Similar to previous studies, the patterns show that the south-eastern regions of the US were widely affected by the H1N1 flu pandemic. Several of these south-eastern states act as bridge regions, which connect the north-east and central US in terms of flu occurrences. Conclusions: These quantitative insights show how the claims data combined with novel analytical techniques can provide important information to decision makers when an epidemic spreads throughout the country. Taken together ORBiT provides a scalable and extensible platform for public health surveillance.",16.93432936686844,7.92259489065905

The first shipments of vaccine to leave those facilities would take several months to develop. Some vaccine is cultured in eggs using a time-consuming process (Morse et al., 2006) . This production schedule cannot be changed using the current technologies and manufacturing approaches. Newer flu vaccine production methods include a cell-based approach approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012. The first approved cell-culture flu vaccine was called Flucelvax. Instead of incubating eggs, vaccine viruses are cultured mammalian cells, purified and tested for use in vaccine. In most cases, to achieve necessary immunity with any inactivated virus, two doses are necessary to activate and sustain an immune response. The newest and fastest process uses recombinant technology. Approved in 2013 under the name, Flublok, the recombinant vaccine is one produced without using egg products or actual virus. Instead, Flublok uses an influenza virus protein made through genetic modification of a virus that infects insect cells.

Second, by calling attention to the relevant data needs, decision-support tools such as SMART Vaccines can accelerate the development of relevant data resources to support ongoing planning as new challenges emerge. Finally, systems-based planning can formally incorporate all of the issues that affect real-world decisions, making it fully apparent as to how these issues affect final choices. In so doing, SMART Vaccines and other systems analysis tools can help focus the attention of decision makers so that planning becomes truly a cohesive process rather than merely the production of static plans that risk becoming outdated at the moment of publication.

In deterministic models, the size of each compartment is influenced by fixed rates of emigration (going out) and immigration (coming in), which can result in fractions of people being assigned to a given compartment. In contrast, stochastic models incorporate the role of chance in determining whether an event occurs (eg, that transmission occurs given an exposure) and, thus, either an event occurs or it does not. Fractions of people are not allowed to enter compartments, and thus stochastic models attempt to better model reality in transmission of Transmission Dynamics Models infectious disease scenarios. However, because stochastic models are usually run through thousands of iterations to identify the average probability of observing the modeled event, the results from deterministic and stochastic models are often similar when applied to large populations. 7 However, by running a stochastic model through many iterations, a distribution of outcomes is obtained, which is more informative than the average result obtained from a deterministic model. 4, 11 Stochastic models have at least 2 advantages over deterministic models. First, they are better at modeling the probability of an epidemic running a course through extinction. 7 Second, they do not require the assumption of a large sample size (which may be unrealistic in some settings) that deterministic models need. 6 There are 2 primary obstacles to developing stochastic models. One is a lack of computing power necessary to run increasingly complex models through the necessary number of iterations, and the other is the increased intellectual difficulty demanded in incorporating the stochastic components. Computing power is rapidly becoming more available to the average infectious disease clinician/epidemiologist. 5 The decision to overcome the second obstacle is a personal decision. Thus, our recommendation to the novice modeler is to start with deterministic models and work into stochastic models as competence and interest dictates.",23.42102997395301,11.309638666237557

A body of scholarly work has debated the role of public opinion in foreign policy decision-making in democratic societies. The discussions have centered on the role of the public in foreign policy decision-making, that is, whether public opinion follows, determines, or sets some limits on leaders who avoid making policies that might later evoke ""public retribution"" (Price 2009 ). Much of the early literature of the two decades after the Second World War, as represented by the works of Walter Lippmann, Hans Morgenthau, and Gabriel Almond, posits a rather pessimistic view of public opinion on domestic and foreign policy issues (Lippman 1922; Morgenthau 1956; Almond 1956) . Studies on public opinion on foreign policy issues were concerned mainly with matters such as war, military intervention abroad, nuclear arms policy, international trade, defense spending, and foreign aid. Policy makers perceived these issues to be far removed from peoples' lives, and the public was disinterested in these issues. Added to this was the belief that some of the foreign policy issues required secrecy, speed, and flexibility in the use of classified information (Holsti 1992) . Decision makers, therefore, felt that there was little need to engage public opinion, which they considered to be erratic, unstable, emotional, and volatile (Almond 1956 ).",27.330450906859266,10.456512280381967

Asia dominates this production, accounting for 89% by capacity and 79% by cost; among Asian countries, China is the leading producer (32.7 million tons in 2008). The speedy development in this region is due to different factors that include preexisting aquaculture practices, populace and financial development, relaxed regulatory framework, and expanding export opportunities. Countries contributing more in aquaculture than wild-caught fish are China, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Egypt. The top 15 aquatic cultureeproducing countries in 2010 by percentage of total worldwide production appear in Fig. 4. 2. It has been reported that China is contributing more than 60% of the worldwide aquaculture production and also using bulk antimicrobials to guarantee sufficient production and disease management. During the 1980se1990s, development in aquaculture was rapid in Europe and North America, but since this time it has stagnated, probably owing to administrative restrictions on sites and other competitive factors, though they have continued the growth of markets for fish and seafood (Bostock et al., 2010) . By 2015 we outreached to a point where the marine food consumed worldwide was w160 million metric tons, Mmt and was grown in farms rather than taken from natural sources. This 80 Mmt of farmed marine food consisted of fish, shellfish, shrimps, and seaweed, with approximately 90% farmed in Asia. By 2050, it is expected that worldwide aquaculture production will double, with well-managed fisheries predicted to demise over this time period.

For instance, models could predict: the chance that a disease will invade particular countries, the expected number of cases within a particular timeframe, or the expected effect of interventions. For this information to be of value, the model must be a sufficiently accurate representation of reality in order to provide useful outputs. All models have a trade-off between complexity and accuracy so it is important to assess which approach is most appropriate for each individual situation (Keeling and Rohani, 2008) . Often multiple models may be developed to describe the same real-world event; this is a natural consequence of no model being completely accurate. Early in a disease outbreak response, real-world information is sparse. Confidence in model accuracy may be increased if multiple different, independent models, developed by independent research groups, converge on a qualitatively similar output (or they may provide clear insight to the reasons for different qualitative behaviour). For example, Mateus and Otete (2014) found that multiple models offer the same qualitative prediction that travel restrictions will not prevent the spread of influenza into susceptible populations. According to Keeling and Rohani (2008) , a good model should be both suited to its purpose (as simple as possible but no simpler) and parameterizable by available data. Deciding which mathematical methods to use is an important decision for modellers (Fowkes and Mahony, 1994) as evaluation of a model comes down to a subjective measure of usefulness (Keeling and Rohani, 2008) . In some circumstances, for instance when modelling is conducted within the UK government, such decisions are made in discussion with the commissioner of the modelling rather than by the modeller alone. Directed by this view, we seek to identify what modelling techniques have been employed to predict the global spread of a pandemic potential disease and what data are available to parametrise these models. Confidence in model outputs is important as, in the case of disease spread models, health protection planning decisions may be directly influenced by these outputs. Confidence in model outputs can be increased through a process known as validation.",21.378041112334607,11.221088414757327

In all probability, however, they will be very location specific. For example, to construct an irrigation scheme in India would likely invite a malaria epidemic, whereas the same activity in sub-Saharan Africa may have little effect on malaria transmission. It is worth mentioning that costs and benefits could depend on the time course over which they are assessed. For example, some land-use changes can lead to short-term increases in transmission followed by longer-term decreases (e.g., irrigation and malaria in Sri Lanka) or vice versa (e.g., deforestation and cutaneous leishmaniasis in Latin America).",22.788757801312624,9.916865468115057

The economic fall-out from COVID-19 appears to be profound, at least $20 trillion in a few short weeks, and may exceed the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The direct costs of COVID-19 travel bans, social distancing, and other responses are merely one aspect. Far more devastating is the uncertainty that has gripped capital markets. Declining economic activity and large drops in capital markets have a mutually reinforcing impact, undermining the capacity of heavily indebted businesses and households to cover their debts. Uncertainty is the primary driver of such crises, and stems in large measure from lack of close coordination and science-based decision-making. Were there more certainty, households, investors and other economic agents would be less inclined to panic. COVID-19 appears certain to become a very costly lesson that DRR does indeed save many more multiples in avoided costs than its initial investment. An additional point in this regard is that health is a critical infrastructure. The resilience of critical infrastructure is well identified in DRR literature (e.g. [18, 19] ). Resilience is fostered not just by sciencebased decisions and coordination, but also via redundancy to ensure buffer capacity when a particular system collapses [20] . Disaster-illiterate economic policy tends to see redundancy as inefficiency. But in order to cope with COVID-19 and alleviate -if not prevent -future emergencies, supply chains for at least some critical items need to be more local.

First, the proposed triple-diffusion framework is a significant advancement to previous disease-only models and dualdiffusion models, such as Bian and Mao's work. The fusion of disease, information, and human behavior allows a more comprehensive 3D cubic view of the human-disease system, which can only be studied from a 2D planar perspective before. The increase of one dimension exposes much more details of an epidemic and thus enables a deeper understanding of this complex system, for example, the interactive mechanisms among the three diffusion processes. The proposed modeling framework can flexibly accommodate the mobile phone tracking data and the latest census data to improve the accuracy of modeled daytime and nighttime populations. The online social networking data (from Facebook and Twitter) can also be included to modify the way of communications between individuals, as well as the personal influence between them. Second, this model can be further developed into a virtual platform for health decision makers to test disease control policies in many other metropolitan areas. Particularly, since the model explicitly represents the diffusion of information and human preventive behavior, it permits a systematic evaluation of disease control policies that have not been well studied before, such as the mass-media campaigns and behavioral incentive strategies.

Failure to do so may lead to situations that are ethically compromising and undermine public trust, such as when access to critical care resources is denied based on crisis standards by one institution without referral to a nearby institution capable of providing critical care. Regions should institute an Incident Management System (IMS) at the facility, local, regional or state, and national level to exercise command and control over scarce resources. 16 Furthermore, decision-makers should communicate with community emergency services and local hospitals to ensure a coordinated approach to patient transfers, standards of care, and resource allocation. 16 , 17 2.

Th e task force considers all eff orts at augmentation to include all attempts to acquire scarce critical resources or to transfer patients to other health-care facilities that are able to provide care (state, national, and even international partner institutions). 19 In rapidly evolving disasters, critical care may need to be rationed before the appropriate authority has declared an emergency or activated its mass critical care plan, but this should only be done in exceptional circumstances. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, the relevant authority will be responsible for declaring an emergency and activating a mass critical care plan but may not have statutory powers. Nevertheless, a decision to ration critical care should not be made unilaterally at an institutional level because individual institutions do not possess the situational awareness in isolation to operationally or ethically justify such a decision. Similarly, the decision to cease triage should occur in a graduated and coordinated manner by altering the prioritization criteria and exclusion thresholds as resources become available. 19 3.

One possibility is to build production capacity, to be globally distributed if possible, that can be activated in the event of new emerging viruses. From today's perspective, only a few types of viruses are likely to cause respiratory disease that leads to rapid global spread. Surveillance in the animal reservoir paired with virus characterization studies can identify members of virus families that have the potential to cause pandemics. Vaccine candidates using these isolates could then be produced, tested in animals to determine the mechanisms of protection, and tested in humans to establish the safety of the vaccines. It is unlikely that the same viruses that are chosen as vaccine candidates will later cause outbreaks. However, if the vaccine candidate is sufficiently closely related, sequences for the vaccines could be quickly switched and the vaccines for the newly emerging viruses could be swiftly produced and moved to latestage clinical trials right away (while large-scale production is ramped up globally). In addition, stockpiled vaccines based on the initial candidates could be deployed, even if slightly mismatched to the strain causing the outbreak (a strategy that is currently used for H5 and H7 avian influenza virus vaccines). This would allow a response within a few weeks and could potentially stop a virus locally before it becomes pandemic. An alternative but challenging solution would be the development of broadly protective vaccines that cover whole virus families or genera. This effort is ongoing for influenza viruses (Erbelding et al., 2018) and could potentially be applied to coronaviruses, or at least betacoronaviruses.

Meanwhile,infectious diseases continue to threaten humanity. The analysis of Big Data, or vast digital data, presents an opportunity to improve disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Epidemic intelligence contains two components: indicator based and event-based. A relatively new surveillance type has emerged called event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. These systems use information on events impacting health from Internet sources, such as social media or news aggregates. These systems circumvent the limitations of traditional reporting systems by being inexpensive, transparent, and flexible. Yet, innovations and the functionality of these systems can change rapidly. Aim: To update the current state of knowledge on event-based Internet biosurveillance systems by identifying all systems, including current functionality, with hopes to aid decision makers with whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programmes of surveillance. Methods: A systematic review was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, while also including grey literature and other publication types. Results: 50 event-based Internet systems were identified, including an extraction of 15 attributes for each system, described in 99 articles. Each system uses different innovative technology and data sources to gather data, process, and disseminate data to detect infectious disease outbreaks. Conclusions: The review emphasises the importance of using both formal and informal sources for timely and accurate infectious disease outbreak surveillance, cataloguing all event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. By doing so, future researchers will be able to use this review as a library for referencing systems, with hopes of learning, building, and expanding Internet-based surveillance systems.

Several groups are developing communications networks and protocols to disseminate up-to-date information to healthcare providers and the public. Research on influenza biology and epidemiology, animal surveillance, and vaccine and antiviral development has been and will continue to be supported by NIH through grants to academic researchers and through grants that support public-private partnerships. Development of cell culture-based vaccines and the testing in humans of candidate pandemic vaccines made using reverse genetics or classical reassortment techniques should be encouraged. There is also a need to test adjuvanted vaccines and to develop new antiviral agents. It is noteworthy that there are currently only two influenza vaccine manufacturers licensed to distribute vaccine in the US for the 2003-2004 influenza season. It is also noteworthy that 80-90% of produced vaccine is purchased privately, and it takes nearly a full year from the time of selection of strains to the production of usable vaccine. As a result, it will be essential to encourage new vaccine manufacturers and new approaches, including reverse genetics to prepare seed strains, in addition to developing and implementing a vaccine policy that ensures adequate and fair procurement and distribution of the vaccine during an influenza pandemic. Such policies will need to take into account liability protection and equitable global access.

Thus, the view is prevalent that scientists have a responsibility to advise governments, decision makers, and the public, of the possible benefits and risks of new scientific knowledge and science-based technology and to help them choose wisely between available options. There is a need to develop ways for ""Science for Policy"" activities, which will make possible the input of scientific evidence into the decision-making process and aid the resolution of social issues, claims and conflicts. Such an engagement of the scientist requires deep knowledge of the specific scientific issue and a holistic rather than a reductionist approach in translating scientific evidence into public policy; accountability in public policy, many have said, requires scientific evidence to be correctly embedded into the democratic process. The most important criteria for a scientist's contribution in this capacity are scientific competence, integrity, independence and transparency. These are basic prerequisites for an impartial assessment of the facts of science pertaining to the issue at hand worthy of the trust of society. To examine the impacts of policy decisions and to help mitigate their risks it is necessary to base such decisions both on science and on the values of society, to situate scientific evidence in the context of society's value system, and political judgments to be evidence-based.

What's more, the risk of infectious transmission is highly and doubly correlated with human density, as are these diseases of animal origin to the areas' biodiversity. They called these areas ''hot-spots'' for disease risks, mostly situated in intertropical regions. They are advocating for these specific zones to be those on which they concentrate our research efforts as well as international public aid for development. In fact, it is not only biological diversity in animals which must be taken into account, but also the evolution of natural ecosystems and their disappearance over recent years.

Active hedging against fuel costs (which accounts for the majority of operating costs) and insurance on idle capacity,0.10729658298886748,1.334592580795288,1.5580755472183228,d6d5638f-f02e-4436-85b9-84937eb5f970,custom_license/Efficiency analysis of major cruise lines,"This paper provides several managerial implications. First, epidemics affects the cruise lines' sales operation. To mitigate potential travelers' concerns on diseases, cruise lines need to ensure passengers that their service is clean and secure from epidemics. Media advertisement can be an effective tool to relieve potential travelers' worries. In addition, it would be helpful for cruise lines to reposition current operating routes to avoid tourist attractions labelled as ""epidemic zone."" The second implication is that cruise lines should prepare themselves for economic downturn, which poses great threat to earning net income. One way to cope with the shock is hedging. Active hedging against fuel costs (which accounts for the majority of operating costs) and insurance on idle capacity would be essential. Decision-makers should be aware that presumably wasteful spending on hedging in normal times can minimize significant loss during economic downturn. Another critical point is the capital investment. This strategy is essential for cruise lines to increase market share in the long run. The resulting debt burdens, however, can hurt the financial health of expanding cruise lines, leading to reduced net income and dividends for shareholders (note that NCL's main source of non-operating inefficiency is high debt-to-capital ratio, which must have been mainly caused by aggressive capital investment). This can make investors hesitant to further investment, which in turn would increase the debt financing again. Hence, capital investment should be calculated by examining its negative impacts. When investing capital by debt financing, cruise lines should not hesitate to hedge against interest rate, fuel price, foreign currency, and other available hedging mechanisms. This would enable cruise lines to avoid sudden increases in liability (if interest rate gets high) and avoid the postponement of debt payment when the market condition is unfavorable. This paper suggest a few directions for further study. First, if detailed information on hedging strategy of cruise lines becomes available, we can formally estimate the relationship between hedging and non-operating efficiency more quantitatively. Second, one can develop alternative network structures and recalculate the efficiency scores using other types of input and output sets. In this way, we can check whether the efficiency ranking among cruise lines are robust. Third, one can use dynamic DEA models to incorporate the inter-temporal influences between the years. Furthermore, since DEA efficiency measures are deterministic, some authors employed ""bootstrapping"" to draw confidence intervals for efficiency scores (Nguyen, Nguyen, Chang, Chin, & Tongzon, 2016; . The method would be beneficial in checking the robustness of DEA results in future research. Lastly, researchers can improve the method of handling negative output data, rather than substituting negative values by scaling down positive output values among observations, which this paper employed. To this end, researchers need to develop a network DEA model that captures the negativity of data in measuring inefficiency.",22.973867617653966,9.921087949387735

In situations where there are inadequate numbers of individual rooms, patients with confirmed infections may be cohorted in common areas to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. 40 During a standard hospital surge, it is anticipated that institutions can tolerate a 20% increase in critically ill patients with minimal impact. Increases of up to 200% of normal capacity may occur, but only at the cost of degraded capability and a possible modification in the standard of care. When ICU capacity is exceeded, less-ill patients may need to be transferred to other levels of care, such as patients not requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, or intensive neuromonitoring.

Traditional epidemiologic models choose to simplify reality by ignoring both the spatial distribution of populations and possible intrapopulation heterogeneities, whereas more recent solutions based on Individual-Based Modeling (IBM) can achieve high precision but are costly to compute and analyze. We introduce here an original alternative to these two approaches, which relies on a novel hybrid modeling framework and incarnates a multiscale view of epidemics. The model relies on a technical fusion of two modeling paradigms: System Dynamics (SD) and Individual-Based Modeling. It features an aggregated representation of local outbreaks rendered in SD, and at the same time a spatially-explicit simulation of the spread between populations simulated in IBM. We first present the design of this deterministic model, show that it can reproduce the dynamics of real resurgent epidemics, and infer from the sensitivity of several spatial factors absent in compartmental models the importance of having large-scale epidemiological processes represented inside of an explicitly disaggregated metapopulation. After discussing the implications of results obtained from simulation runs and the applicability of this model, we conclude that SD-IB hybrid modeling can be an interesting choice to represent epidemics in a spatially-explicit way without necessarily taking into account individual heterogeneities, and therefore it can be considered as a valuable alternative to simple compartmental models suffering from detrimental effects of the well-mixed assumption.",27.85875346884069,12.506230142898639

We benchmark airlines based on their ability in maximising capacity utilisation rates. Total capacity offered by airlines can be divided into two components: (i) the number of available seat kilometres (ASK) as a measure of capacity reserved to passenger service and (ii) the available freight ton kilometres (AFTK) as a measure of cargo capacity. These two input variables depend on airlines' strategies in terms of combined aircraft sizes, flight frequencies, and routes offered. Airlines can exploit this capacity by transporting passengers and/or freight. Hence, the desirable production-process outputs include (i) the number of revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), and (ii) the revenue tonnes of freight kilometres (TFTK). Finally, the CO 2 emitted represents an undesirable output of airlines' production process. This is a simple but effective representation of airlines' production process. Airlines are efficient when they carry as many passengers and freight as possible and produce as little CO 2 as possible given the flights operated (i.e., the capacities inputs). Notice that given the level of inputs, airlines can increase their efficiency (i) by reducing CO 2 emissions, which requires operating greener aircrafts, and (ii) by increasing passenger and freight volumes. Moreover, according to our variable selection, we indirectly compare airlines in terms of load factors (i.e., passenger and cargo load factor) and the unitary amount of CO 2 produced (CO 2 /ASK and CO 2 /AFTK are the bad output/input ratios). Given the objectives of this paper, we do not consider ticket pricing, quality of the service, or airlines' profitability. However, in a certain sense, the effect of quality of service and fare levels is reflected in airlines' load factors. In the extant literature, the most used output variables are passenger and freight volumes (Barla and Perelman, 1989; Cornwell et al., 1990; Oum and Yu, 1995; Baltagi et al., 1995; Coelli et al., 1999; Barbot et al., 2008) usually measured in RPK and total freight ton kilometres (TFTK). On the input side, there is variety with the most popular variables represented by capital assets (e.g., capital expenses and number of planes), capacity (e.g., aircraft capacity, available seat kilometres) and operational costs (e.g., fuel and/or labour costs/quantities). If our output choice is consistent with the previous research, our input variables slightly differ since labour and fuel are not considered in the analysis. The motivation for our choice is that fuel consumption is directly proportional to CO 2 production. This proportionality could cause biases in the DEA models used to compute the productivity indices. Moreover, data envelopment analysis in order to produce a meaningful production frontier requires substitutable inputs and complementary outputs (Bogetoft and Otto, 2011) . The common choice of using capacity and labour as inputs in a DEA approach may raise concerns about the substitutability requirement (e.g., moving on input isoquants, it is possible to use more (less) labour and less (more) capacity to carry the same amount of passengers). Our variable selection meets the requirements of substitutability and complementarity while effectively describing the airline production process.",20.347239749360266,9.822368663405243

More stars indicate greater goodness, in the decision maker's eyes. Observe that the situation illustrates ''feature conflict."" One feature dimension favors Apt 1 while the other favors Apt 2; neither alternative would be described as ''dominating"" the other. Such a situation is sometimes described as a challenging ''tradeoff dilemma."" Apt 1 is better by one star on Condition whereas the opposite is true for Distance. If the searcher chooses Apt 1, it might be because she feels that, in picking Apt 1 over Apt 2, she has traded a one-star advantage on Distance for a one-star advantage on Condition, and that that is consistent with what her actual experiences would be if she were to live in each apartment. The ''tradeoffs"" issue concerns how people should and do, in fact, resolve tradeoff dilemmas. This is important because almost all decision situations eventually are reduced to such dilemmas, in some form or another. Our primary concern here is whether and how cultures differ in how they resolve tradeoff dilemmas. There has been very little research on the matter. However, efforts by P.C. Chu and Eric Spires have been informative about cultural variations involving the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, and the U.S. (Chu & Spires, 2008; Chu, Spires, Farn, & Sueyoshi, 2005; Chu, Spires, & Sueyoshi, 1999) . One key finding has been that Japanese decision makers are significantly more attracted to noncompensatory schemes for addressing dilemmas and that Americans are among the most strongly inclined toward compensatory schemes. A ''compensatory"" approach is one such that weakness on one feature dimension can be offset or ''compensated for"" by strength on another. This was implied in our apartment example, where the decision maker chose Apt 1 because she felt that gaining an extra star's worth of condition more than made up for the sacrifice of suffering an extra star's burden in commuting each day. A ''noncompensatory"" scheme is one for which a deficiency on one feature dimension cannot be offset by strength on another. Suppose that in our apartment case, the searcher's scheme is such that an apartment simply must have three stars or more with respect to Condition. Thus, no matter how good Apt 2 was on Distance, it would never be chosen. This is just one form of noncompensation we see.",21.517801595417883,9.738487692118564

Typically, this decision originates with searching for organisms innately capable of achieving some desired biosynthetic activity or phenotype 99 . For biofuel production, for instance, microorganisms have evolved to be proficient in converting lignocellulosic material to ethanol, biobutanol, and other biofuels. These native isolates possess unique catabolic activity, heightened tolerances for toxic materials, and a host of enzymes designed to break down the lignocellulosic components. Unfortunately, these highly desired properties exist in pathways that are tightly regulated according to the host's evolved needs and therefore may not be suitable in their native state for production scale. A longstanding challenge in metabolic and genetic engineering is determining whether to improve the isolate host's production capacity or whether to transplant the desired genes/pathways into an industrial model host, such as E. coli or S. cerevisiae; these important considerations and tradeoffs are reviewed elsewhere 99 .",33.34800660639067,14.944311696392008

The World Health Organization has recommended using a decision cutoff of 1 to 3 times per capita gross domestic product, although it has more recently been reviewing alternative threshold estimation approaches [17] . In England, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence uses a cutoff of ₤20,000/ QALY, increasing to ₤30,000, and even to £50,000 in special circumstances.

In the first section, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of QALYs. As a specific example, in the second section we describe a recently developed methodology called ""extended"" CEA (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility, which has been applied to some specific interventions. ECEA adds two features-the element of financial risk protection (one part of insurance value assessed in the article by Garrison et al. [2] ) and income distributional consequences. The third section discusses further options for expanding this approach (what we call ""augmented"" CEA [ACEA]). In the fourth section we discuss another, even broader approach called multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) that has some intuitive appeal, especially for decision makers who consider other elements or components not easily measured in CEA or CBA. This approach requires that decision makers place quantitative weights on the various criteria, depending on their relative importance for a decision. This exercise can make group decision making more transparent. The fifth section discusses budget-setting and prioritization in these frameworks, building upon the previous discussion in the article by Danzon et al. [3] discussing the situation in which budget allocations and decision-making cutoffs are not perfectly aligned. The sixth section discusses deliberative processes that represent another important approach for population-or planlevel decisions that is used by many HTA bodies. It uses quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but in the end, the group decision is reached by a deliberative voting process.

Finally, the effect of behavioral change may be to change individual disease states [7-9, 11, 21, 24, 31, 32, 36, 46, 79, 86, 89, 104] , model parameters [4, 27, 37, 43, 62, 101] or contact structure [37, 84, 93, 109] .",28.210183267013218,12.413874711072042

Promoting creativity is harder than it appears, often requiring researchers and decision-makers to think differently than they were taught. For example, many scientists, especially life scientists, approach research from a discovery science standpoint, i.e., they develop and test hypotheses to generate knowledge, create new products (e.g., high-throughput drug discovery and pre-clinical vaccine development), and/or develop new technologies to improve research efforts or as product platforms. On the other end of the spectrum are engineers, who often conduct design-based research, which involves identifying the specific product needs before developing the methodological approach to achieve the desired output (e.g., synthetic organisms designed to produce industrial chemicals). Both approaches enable innovation within fields and sometimes across fields, but they also may contribute to conceptual barriers to identifying solutions from high-level need.

In addition, although quasi-experimental studies are more feasible and practical to conduct, the lack of randomization is a threat to the internal validity and limits the generalizability of the results to larger populations. 11 Although simpler non-mechanistic modeling approaches, such as statistical models and analytical models, have also been used to evaluate IPC interventions, they cannot capture the complexity and dynamics of HAI transmission and the health care contexts in which the interventions are implemented. Therefore, a more comparable, reliable, and easy-to-use planning tool is needed to assess interventions and their impacts. 12 Modeling is increasingly being used to improve the understanding of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on IPC intervention. Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients, pathogens, and the environment is particularly useful for studying complex systems such as the health care system. 13 A simulation model can be used to understand the dynamics of HAIs and IPC and how various complexities influence these dynamics or to predict outcomes of IPC interventions. The latter can only be done credibly provided we understand the system. Simulation modeling provides a risk-free environment in which ideas on IPC strategies can be tested in a systematic manner without the time, costs, and risks associated with experiments conducted in a real-world setting. It is a valuable tool to guide the selection of the most appropriate empirical research to pursue and to examine the effects of IPC strategies, serving as a ""virtual policy laboratory"" for decision support by researchers, policy makers, public health officials, hospital managers and administrators, and other health care decision-makers. 14 Like other modeling methodologies that try to predict outcomes, simulation modeling does not necessarily provide precise results that are completely reliable (eg, the exact number of infections or the precise course of an epidemic). Perfect prediction using simulation can rarely be achieved because it is impossible to build a model that fully replicates the real world, particularly when we describe a stochastic system as complex as infection transmission, which is influenced by human behavior, pathogen and host biological characteristics, and the health facility structure among many factors. Nonetheless, simulation modeling can help us to understand the relative effectiveness of different interventions, identify the risk of HAIs for different population groups, provide confidence intervals on the epidemic behaviors and, therefore, aid with decision making. IPC decision-makers using simulation models for decision-support must consider model assumptions and their relevance to the particular context in addition to carefully weighing the predicted benefits of interventions against the inconvenience, stigmatization, and costs they might engender.",34.658686412099954,16.113991932524627

In most other European countries it was treated as a medicinal product, and the use of SD plasma was often permitted during the registration process because of its obvious virus safety, particularly with regard to HCV. SD plasma was first introduced in 1991 in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. In Norway, SD plasma replaced FFP in 1993 following a successful clinical trial in 1992 [32] . Currently, ordinary medicinal licensing is required for SD plasma in European countries except France, where it is classed as a labeled blood product. Octaplas is now a licensed biopharmaceutical product in 29 countries worldwide. So far, Octa-plasLG has been approved for use in Germany and Australia, and regulatory procedures are ongoing in other European countries. Confirmatory studies on the claimed capacity to remove prions that were requested by some countries are nearing completion. The approval process for Uniplas is also in its final stages (T.E. Svae, Octapharma, personal communication). In the USA, regulatory approval was long delayed compared to Europe. The FDA's attitude toward SD plasma began to change in 1990-1991. As clinical data accumulated, it became clear that US approval for SD plasma was justified, but the requirement to have sufficient production capacity (2,000,000 units/year) and a nation-level distribution partner delayed FDA approval until 1998. By then VITEX had increased its production capacity for SD plasma sufficiently, and the American Red Cross (ARC) was selected as sole distributor.

Included as core functions are environmental scanning; integration of human, animal, and plant health information; and assessment and forecasting of potential consequences. One month prior to the Strategy's release, the U.S. government established an interagency working group on science and technology for biosurveillance, which was chaired by the White House Office and Science and Technology Policy and DoD. This working group was tasked with developing the research and development priorities for achieving the core functions of the National Strategy for Biosurveillance. The working group discussion culminated in the release of the National Biosurveillance Science and Technology Roadmap in 2013, which defined the key priorities for detecting unusual or above-baseline events, anticipating risk including assessment of the potential consequences of incidents, identification and characterization of threats to human health, and integration of, analysis of, and information-sharing with key decision-makers, responders, and healthcare providers. The roadmap highlights current national activities in each of these areas and identifies capability needs to achieve the described priorities.

Inhibition of viral replication with efficient antivirals is likely essential but not sufficient to achieve optimal patient outcomes in severe human influenza. Effective immunomodulatory interventions, particularly combined with antivirals during periods of active viral replication, are needed for such patients. However, the functional redundancy of the pathways and rapid changes in responses over time involved create challenges for intervention. Considerable heterogeneity exists in innate immune responses related to both host and viral factors. Key questions regarding the particular targets for intervention, their appropriate level of inhibition, the timing (both initiation and cessation) of intervention within the course of infection and the appropriate patient populations remain to be resolved. Downregulation of overly exuberant innate immune responses also has the potential to upregulate viral replication and increases the risk of secondary bacterial infections. It is also clear that deficient innate immune responses exist in certain situations (e.g. inadequate interferon production or signalling) that might be amenable to targeted upregulation or exogenous supplementation.",16.233504116201104,9.616244611027136

At the global level, international policies regulate trade in goods. As this partially predicts income distribution, governance, trade, and income are closely intertwined. At the national level, income mediates the effect of global governance on population health. A classic example is the debate over generic pharmaceutical production in developing countries that arose over the need for antiretroviral (ARV) medication for HIV. Under the TRIPS agreement created by the WTO, the production of patented medications was prohibited at the global level. The result was that national access to expensive medications was determined by national income; rich countries could afford to buy life-saving medication for their populations and poor countries could not. To pursue this example to the community level, countries with enough income to purchase limited supplies of ARVs might offer better health outcomes to high income communities that could afford the high prices. Alternatively, these nations might choose other distribution criteria, offering the medications to government employees or to those seeking care at a certain health facility. It is easy to understand how, in a community with high HIV prevalence, differential access to ARVs might erode social cohesion and trust (Bennett & Chanfreau, 2005) .

Of the 31 papers selected in the first set of literature, 30 included the community as part of the relevant range of stakeholders that should be included in priority setting processes (data not shown). The participation of the public in priority setting processes has not only been shown to be minimal, but has also generated significant debate. 64 Debating points include how public engagement should be obtained, when it should be sought, and how public views should be incorporated in decision-making. It has been proposed that priority setting should be based on the values of the community. 65, 66 Health organizations are seen as social organizations that exist to, among others, meet society's needs. [65] [66] [67] Under the communitarian claims approach, the citizen is required to ""set the stage"" for policy-makers to allocate resources by determining the procedural rules that policy-makers are expected to play by. 66 The relationship between citizens and policy-makers is here considered to be a principal-agent relationship at a social level. 65 Here citizens, who are assumed to have limited capacity to make technical healthcare decisions entrust this responsibility to healthcare decision-makers. 68 Rowe and Frewer 69 have proposed a framework to assess the degree of public participation in decision-making which has three participation levels namely: (1) Communication, (2) Consultation, and (3) Participation. In communication, information is passed from the decision-maker to the public such as through newspaper advertisements or announcements on notice boards. In consultation, information is passed from the public to the decision-maker without dialogue or interaction such as through client surveys or suggestion boxes. 69 In participation, there is negotiation and dialogue between decision-makers and the public. 69 Examples of participation methods include citizen juries or planning cells. Attempts at incorporating public participation methods in healthcare decision-making have experienced a number of challenges. It has been argued that the public is unlikely to be objective especially on issues that directly affect them. 64 It has also been argued that the public might not be competent to contribute to technical debates on healthcare decisionmaking. 34 It has also been shown that the empowerment of the public is not automatic and that a number of factors come into play. For example, in Tanzania, similar to most other settings, effective participation of the public in priority setting decisions was influenced by gender, wealth, ethnicity and education. 42 Members of the public who were male, more educated, and wealthier or shared ethnicity with decisionmakers were more empowered in decision-making spaces.",35.79740014794932,15.867395465505252

In another study, Alshehri et al. [16] found that 55% of study participants access official information about biological disasters through the Internet. After the 2011 flood in Jeddah, online social media was used for publicizing the gravity of the disaster, advising people what to do and what to avoid, and mobilization for help and rescue [32] .

The Internet and social media have been considered as promising in providing opportunities for greater social and political participation.

A country's essential medicines list, for example, ought to be based on population needs, evidence of effectiveness, and cost. Law and regulation are integral to making difficult choices, because they establish processes and institutions to guide transparent decision making. States use legal processes to express national health priorities, and legal frameworks define and delineate that which is possible for a state to achieve. In determining what is and is not covered, states use a variety of legal mechanisms and institutions, including the following four examples. First, independent statutory authorities are tasked with reviewing clinical and epidemiological evidence and providing advice to governments about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments and technologiesfor example, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Second, administrative agencies are tasked with determining which medications are placed on formularies, and the amount or extent of any government subsidy. Third, legislation can specify which services, or categories of services should be provided under a UHC scheme. Finally, courts and tribunals can make de-facto decisions on service prioritisation. In South Africa, the Constitutional Court required access to antiretroviral medication for pregnant women, 60 while in Brazil the judiciary has ruled on numerous claims of denial of access to medicines. Conversely, Colombia's Constitution Court required priorities to be decided through a participatory, evidence-based process (panel 4). Litigation can raise its own problems, including the concern that it could favour wealthy litigants and thus entrench health inequalities. 163 Finally, good governance is an important role of the law in achieving UHC. An effective UHC programme requires a process of monitoring, evaluation, and accountability, including independent review, dispute resolution, and a compensatory process in the event of adverse outcomes, as well as other administrative, political, legal, and social remedies. 164 Again, law plays a vital role.

However, structural models are not very useful for long-run forecasting because it is difficult to come up with forecasts for the explanatory variables in such models, such as investment and production capacity and inventory levels, over long time horizons. As a consequence, industry forecasts of crude oil prices typically assume prices grow in real terms at some fixed rate. One possibility is that prices follow a random walk. Another possibility is that prices revert to a trend line, which implies that shocks to oil prices are temporary. As Pindyck (1999) noted, if oil prices are trend reverting this is consistent with crude oil being sold in a competitive market where price reverts to long-run marginal cost, which changes only slowly.",21.398519527087714,10.59698686988109

Increased resilience to stress via increased biodiversity has been described in a number of natural systems. Diversity in food production can be considered on the following three levels: (a) genetic diversity as reflected in the range of cultivars which can be selected for production; (b) species diversity, captured through production of a wide range of crops on each farm; and (c) broad ecosystem diversity, described by the diversity of production between farms and within the broader food system. A network of locally based food producers and entrepreneurs provides opportunity for high diversity at each network stage, with increased adaptive capacity and the ability for rapid response to disturbance. We argue that production techniques that use carefully planned diverse plantings, such as biointensive cultivation, increase resilience by increased water use efficiency, yield and nutrient retention while reducing pressure from pests and pathogens. We present a model for a diverse, distributed food system in the North Carolina Piedmont and analyze an existing distributed network by a food hub in South Carolina. Through these models, we argue that a shift in the food network has the potential to increase local food security by having food more reliably available where it is needed and by contributing to local resilience through community economic development. The shift in food production and distribution systems serves multiple goals: When crop loss occurs, other crops still contribute to overall harvest, reducing net loss. Diverse on-farm production can support a more distributed network of food aggregators, processors, and markets than the current approach of large-scale consolidation. Finally, a distributed food supply network supported with diverse agricultural products can increase resilience by providing access to diversified markets for producers and improved food access to consumers with more food choices, while expanding the need for skilled jobs supporting the regionally based food industry.",24.83323754184581,10.143469937241058

Concurrently, crop residues (Ward, 1978; Watson et al., 2015) and corn co-products from ethanol production (Klopfenstein et al., 2008) represent feed resources for beef production that are becoming more abundant, and opportunities to expand their use remain. Investigating alternative management strategies to increase pasture stocking rate and maintain beef production on finite resources is warranted. A practical approach to increase stocking rate may be to replace a portion of the grazed forage by supplementing low-quality crop residues mixed with co-products. Theoretically, replacing approximately 50% of the grazed forage with supplemental feed would support a 2-fold increase in stocking rate. Therefore, the objectives of this multiyear experiment were to evaluate the effects of supplementing modified distillers grains plus solubles (MDGS) mixed with low-quality crop residues to cow-calf pairs grazing smooth bromegrass pastures on (1) cow and calf performance and (2) production economics.",21.42719314438501,10.562092046736078

Dr. Liu identified the three-dimensional complexities, inherent to the lung, as a formidable challenge to tissue regeneration in lung in which newly generated lung epithelia need to be in close proximity to vascular structures to assure appropriate gas exchange. Dr. Liu further discussed that current approaches to cellbased therapies in lung have focused in targeting progenitors to areas of injury where they are needed. These strategies have been based on the use of tissue-specific progenitors, expanded and sometimes modified in culture, administered as cell suspensions either systemically or intratracheally. A viable alternative is the introduction of engineered tissue into the lung with hopes for survival of the graft and subsequent expansion with invasion of the graft by native cells.

Methods: A sample of 71 consecutive children enrolled in the Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study were selected. Children suffering from frequently recurring respiratory infections (FRRIs) were defined as the highest quintile of the entire cohort of 329 children, as regards the number of upper respiratory infections (URIs) and/or episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) during the follow-up period from 2 to 24 months. Results: In the sample of 71 children, there were 18 children with FRRI ( ] 9 URI and/or ] 4 AOM). Leukocyte cultures, prepared from blood drawn from these 18 children at 6 months of age, produced lower yields of IFN than those of the remaining 53 children, when stimulated with adenovirus (P B 0.001), coronavirus (P B0.001) or rhinovirus (P= 0.002). The difference in IFN yields was even greater (P B0.001 with all three viruses) if the comparison was made between children with FRRI and those with no or maximally one URI during the follow-up period. When the IFN production capacity induced by rhinovirus was measured at the age of 24 months, a statistically significant difference between the children with FRRI and the others was also seen (P =0.002). Influenza A virus-induced IFN production capacity did not differ between the groups at either age (P = 0.209). Conclusions: Lowered IFN responses in children suffering from recurrent URIs and/or AOM may, in a subgroup of the children, be due to a genetic property of the child. However, because of the great interindividual variations, we cannot use the IFN production capacity as such for prediction of forthcoming respiratory infections and/or otitis media.",24.708207547653295,12.790844836827121

COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality. We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households. 5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities.

(2) Since then, the oral spraying method has become the standard administration model for polio vaccines, which eventually contributed to the eradication of polio worldwide. Vaccines are generally produced in animal organs or cells, with the inherent risk of animal pathogen contamination. Recent advances in the field of molecular immunology and biotechnology have created opportunities for the use of recombinant vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in the prevention and control of infectious disease or cancer. (2, 3) Plant genetic engineering can now be applied to express valuable recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins on an industrial scale. The advantages of plant expression systems include large-scale production capacity, lack of animal pathogen contamination, and low cost of biomass production, compared to mammalian systems.

The vaccines and bio-therapeutic protein production in plants hold the promise of significantly lowering the cost of manufacturing life-saving drugs. This review will reflect the current status and challenges that the molecular farming platform faces becoming a strategic solution for the development of low-cost bio-therapeutics for developing countries. Recent Findings Different plant parts have been successfully identified as suitable expression systems for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins for some human and animal diseases ranging from common cold to AIDS. The processed therapeutics from such sources are devoid of any toxic components. The large-scale cultivation of these transgenic plants would be possible anywhere in the world including developing countries, which lack sophisticated drug manufacturing units. A couple of such commercially generated products have already hit the market with success. Newer methods using suitable plant viruses and recombinant gene expression systems have already been devised for producing therapeutic proteins and peptides. Summary Plants are promising bio-factories for therapeutic protein production because of their several advantages over the other expression systems especially the advanced mechanisms for protein synthesis and post-translational modification which are very much similar to animal cells. Plant biotechnologists are much attracted to the bio-farming because of its flexibility, scalability, low manufacturing cost, as well as the lack of risk of toxic or pathogenic contamination. A number of projects on bio-farming are designed and are at various developmental stages but have not yet become available to the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we need further advancement in the optimization of lab protocols for up-scaling the production of such therapeutics at commercial level with a promise to offer their best clinical use.",19.515944557428377,9.992795577609545

In order to advance our understanding of those disease processes at work, novel approaches have been evolved that utilize newly developed state-of-the-art techniques and technologies. Systems biology [15] utilizes an integration of traditional pathogenesis approaches, as well as high-throughput molecular profiling, and computational modeling to identify key host genes and pathways involved in pathogenesis. In a related way [16] , systems genetics integrates molecular profiling and pathogenesis readouts within genetically complex populations to identify genes and pathways that contribute to disease variation across genetically diverse populations. Integration of both platforms provides unparalleled power in identifying and studying host susceptibility networks that contribute to disease outcomes. The common feature of both discovery platforms is that they seek to understand viral disease as part of complex, interacting systems with multiple genes and response pathways. While fundamentally different from standard reductionist strategies, these approaches still rely on standard genetic, molecular biology, biochemical and immunologic strategies to validate the role of targeted genes and networks in disease processes. Using these approaches, there is hope that model systems and platform approaches can be utilized to identify critical regulators of disease across genetically diverse human populations, and to transition these findings into prophylactic and therapeutic drugs.",23.99327127100309,12.939820869629067

A particular problem for German airports which impedes the acquisition of new airlines and destinations is the dominating role of Lufthansa. Nearly every German carrier which owns aircraft suitable for scheduled flights to smaller airports (18-70 passengers) depends on the former flag carrier. Either they belong to the Lufthansa group (like Eurowings) or they are a franchise partner (Lufthansa Regional, formerly Team Lufthansa), or they are at least partners in the Lufthansa mileage programme. According to these criteria, only two small carriers are fully independent. Because other domestic or foreign carriers are normally not interested in operating regional aircraft, some airports have asked local business aviation carriers to offer scheduled flights (e.g. in Kiel, Neubrandenburg, Kassel and Siegerland), but they have had only limited success, due to the small and uncomfortable planes (e.g. Beech 1900, Metroliner or King Air 200) and size-related marketing problems.",20.696299766123794,7.688782975752825

They need to decide whether and when to close schools, how many schools to close, and how long they should keep schools closed. An official may choose to keep schools open and simply isolate students who contract influenza, close schools in which influenza cases appear (individual school closure), shut down the entire school system as soon as enough cases appear in the community, or some combination of these various strategies. The optimal choice depends on the potential effectiveness of each strategy and any synergistic effects in mitigating an influenza epidemic. However, decision makers may not have enough available data to make effective choices between the different strategies, and prospective studies may be difficult or impossible to perform.

One of the most overlooked but crucial aspects in identifying a potential foodborne related incident is the role that medical practitioners, veterinarians and epidemiologists, in other words the gatekeepers play in recognizing idiopathic disease cases or more than average occurrences of certain disease symptoms [40] . This is not a trivial task as these professionals need to recognize relatively uncommon or completely new infectious diseases, on the basis of changing clinical and epidemiological trends or a ""gut-feeling"", as syndromic surveillance systems targeting non-respiratory disease are sparse. Integrated networks for syndrome surveillance in combination with routine diagnostic surveillance activities for known pathogens in theory would aid in identification of threats which may otherwise fly under the radar. To date, however, no precise and consistent global baseline syndromic surveillance exists, with the exception of the sentinel surveillance system for influenza.

These in turn cause increasing challenges for public health systems, including the increasing burden of infectious disease, and the need to build a surveillance and response system that is able to identify newly emerging disease rapidly, both regionally and internationally which calls for international collaboration, and the need for drug and vaccine research and production [6] [7] [8] . While the response to endemic diseases may be less urgent, the burden caused by pathogens such as influenza or malaria is high [9] [10] [11] , and due to their endemicity, many countries have long standing surveillance systems to track outbreaks and guide response, from vector control to hospital bed utilization [12] [13] [14] [15] . Early warning systems aiming to predict epidemics as soon as possible can allow control methods to be carried out rapidly and increase their chance of success [16, 17] . To do so, decision makers need to be able to make accurate forecasts of incidence and to automate this forecasting process based on routinely collected notification data [18] . If accurate forecasts were available in both the near and far future, effective policies could then be targeted to the expected future needs. Existing approaches to real-time forecasting include generalized linear regression, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model or a simpler ARIMA form of it, phenomenological models like the logistic growth model and Richards model, and mechanistic models like the SIR models [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Often such approaches involve the challenge of integrating environmental factors including temperature, humidity and rainfall, which may influence pathogen transmission directly or affect the vector activities (for vector borne diseases), especially in temperate regions [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . For instance, influenza virus is more transmissible in low temperature and low humidity conditions [30, 31] , while the primary vector of dengue, the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, favors higher temperature [32, 33] .

Some changes in the force of infection may also be caused by changing risk behaviors in the population when perceiving a higher risk during an outbreak. By taking into account these changes, dynamic models can 1) produce nonlinear dynamics, 2) predict higher number of cases prevented, and 3) predict changes in morbidity and mortality due to age shifts. Typespecific dynamic transmission models are necessary when interventions can induce selective pressures that cause a subset of pathogen types, or even other microbes, to gain a competitive advantage [16, 33] (e.g., type replacement following vaccination [16, 34, 35] and antimicrobial resistance [33, 36] ). Dynamic models must be used when decision makers are interested in local elimination of an infectious disease, or eradication (i.e., global elimination) [32] .

Therefore, biologically active molecules are more commonly extracted from their natural sources. However, since most of the source plants are wild rather than domesticated species, harvesting from their natural habitats presents a risk of overexploitation, as well as creating a bottleneck in the production of the compounds. Further complications include the slow growth rates of many source plants, the low concentrations of the active compounds of interest and, frequently, the need for biotic or abiotic stress to induce biosynthesis. All these factors make the extraction of secondary metabolites from source species highly inefficient (Atanasov et al. 2015; Ochoa-Villarreal et al. 2016 ) and emphasize the need for novel approaches for secondary metabolite production.",22.357339065674832,10.446649077029388

To allow for such fine tuning, the national delegations in the respective committees were put under repeated pressure to share with their other delegations and with the Commission information on their national efforts under each theme and topic. Hence, the delineation of EC priorities became a more rational process. Specific studies and compilations, even a dedicated ad hoc group of one of these committees, were called for. This exercise proved difficult to implement, incomplete and became rapidly obsolete. Clearly, this was signalling a serious limitation in trying to ensure an optimal governance of Biotechnology (or other research likewise) across Europe, if the shared information was only allowed to flow in a centrifugal mode (from the EC core to Member States), while the centripetal mode (from the Member States to the EC core) failed to feed the process. The governance issue was revisited in 2002 with the publication of the Commission Strategy for Life Sciences and Biotechnology [24] and in 2012 with the Commission Communication on the Bioeconomy [25] . It also became an issue in the wider context of new initiatives encouraging Joint Programmes with Member States in variable configurations [26] -but this is another story.",22.386140339276494,11.976058790530221

More recently, imaging has been used primarily for examining the strength of the association between an infectious agent and a disease by testing for its presence at the site of pathology [22] [23] [24] . Although rapid protocols for electron microscopy exist that allow the visualization of viruses in a few hours, they require substantial operator expertise and a high agent concentration. Immunohistochemical assays can be pursued using serum from either the affected individual or one with a similar disease, or with antibodies generated in animal models inoculated with the virus candidate or immunized with viral proteins [25] . Where serum is already available these approaches can be implemented rapidly; however, with truly novel agents the delay required to create immunological reagents is typically measured in weeks to months.

Viral coat proteins can be expressed and spontaneously self-assembled in the bacterial cells, and this has been demonstrated for bacteriophages, such as Qβ 28 and MS2, 29 as well as for heterologous expression of other viruses, such as plant virus-based TMV 30 and mammalian virus-based hepatitis B virus (HBV) core particles. 31 It should be noted that while VLPs formed in this way do not contain their own genomic content, they are also not ""empty"", as they tend to package host nucleic acids. For example, about 25% of the mass of Qβ VLPs (a system that has undergone clinical testing) consists of E. coli RNA. 32 For applications where the packaged nucleic acid is undersirable, several methods have been developed to remove the nucleic acid components after particle assembly. [33] [34] [35] These methods include treatment with heavy metals such as lead acetate, 33 incubation in alkaline conditions for RNA hydrolysis, 34 and induction of osmotic shock using a high molarity sodium sulfate solution. 35 Another approach for production of empty VLPs is in vitro assembly of coat protein subunits after production in E. coli and purification. In vitro assembly is also a way to overcome challenges with insolubility of some eukaryotic capsid proteins in the bacteria cells that result in their accumulation in inclusion bodies. 36 Digressing briefly, it is of significance to note that some headway has been made with producing soluble eukaryotic cDNA of the virus genome, or even in vitro RNA transcripts to the leaves of the plant after gentle abrasion. 54, 55 Agroinfiltration by injecting a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens bacteria into leaves is also used for molecular farming in plants. 56 These bacteria transfer part of their tumor inducing plasmid into the plant cell, which can be exploited for transient expression of genes of interest. Of note, Medicago Inc. uses this plant-based approach for the efficient production of VLP-based vaccines for influenza and rabies, among others. Other therapeutics such as the ZMAPP monoclonal antibody cocktail against Ebola virus (EBOV) from Mapp Biopharmaceutical also utilize plant production with agroinfiltration. 57 Replication of intact VNPs such as BMV has been demonstrated. 58 Additionally, viral capsids of CPMV completely devoid of RNA (either virus or host) can be produced in this way. 59 Whereas BMV production utilized plasmids that transiently express BMV RNAs to systemically infect plants, for empty CPMV (eCPMV) VLP production, using plasmids encoding just two proteins was found to be sufficient: VP60, which is a precursor to CPMV's two coat proteins, and 24K proteinase for proteolytic processing of VP60. As mentioned previously, consistent empty VLP production in vivo has only been demonstrated for the eCPMV platform. Aside from farming in the plants themselves, some new technology that may be applied in the future for the production of VLPs is the use of plant cell packs for transient expression, where plant suspension cells are packed into a ""cookie"" through suctioning, then Agrobacterium containing the gene for the protein of interest applied. 60 This approach has been proven to produce high yields of recombinant proteins and can be applied in a high throughput manner, making it an attractive option for VLP expression.",17.61467734134372,9.335148077256099

BoNTs are among the most toxic substances known with an estimated human lethal dose of 1 ng/kg body weight. (1) Naturally occurring botulism transpires from the ingestion of contaminated food or the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by BoNT-producing clostridia. However, the relative ease of production and the lethality of all the BoNT subtypes has resulted in their inclusion on the Category A Select Agents and Toxins list. (1) Furthermore, mass vaccination against BoNTs is unlikely due to the rarity of the naturally occurring disease, the limited availability and crudeness of the current pentavalent vaccine, and the subsequent inability to use BoNT therapy in vaccines. (1) Neutralizing antibodies have been observed to be protective against toxin challenge. Indeed, polyclonal therapies against BoNT include human immunoglobulin for infant botulism (BoNT serotypes A and B) and equine immunoglobulin for adult botulism (BoNT serotypes A, B, and E). (1, 2) In addition, a despeciated investigational heptavalent antitoxin (HBAT), which contains antibodies to all seven known BoNT serotypes, has recently become available to treat adult botulism. (3) (4) (5) The potential severity and lethality of botulism poisoning require that a patient presenting clinical symptoms receive antitoxin in a timely manner, before receiving a definitive diagnosis. (2, 6, 7) To date, the gold standard to detect BoNT in clinical samples is the mouse toxicity assay. While both sensitive and specific, this assay takes up to 96 h to complete and requires specialized personnel, facility, and reagent resources. (8) Due to adverse patient reactions that can occur and batch variation in polyclonal immunoglobulin production, it is desirable to develop rapid methods of diagnosis that permit accurate and sensitive BoNT detection and serotyping capability to ensure the correct course of treatment is initiated as soon as possible. Many efforts have been made to develop alternative, immunologically based assays for BoNT detection in clinical samples, yet these assays are often limited by the availability of high-quality antibodies. (8) The production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against BoNTs is an excellent choice for several reasons. First, MAbs are consistent between lots. Second, they are well defined and are theoretically in unlimited supply. Mammalian cell lines scale up readily and provide a means to produce clinical grade material. Third, murine hybridomas with bioactivity provide good lead molecules that can be modified by recombinant means for improved bioactivity and/or less immunogenicity, the latter, for example, by simple chimerization strategies.",16.53095363943793,8.113034877967399

By using these models we hope to capture important aspects of the behavior of the whole system and gain a full understanding of the role of the individual processes and their interactions in determining this behavior.

In general, SCFGs are outperformed by physics based approaches, although recently Do et al. proposed a generalization of SCFGs where a flexible and richer feature set allows to include free energy parameters more akin to thermodynamic models [21] . However, the complexity of the RNA secondary structures predicted by these methods is restricted by the expressibility of their grammars, thus highly complex structures, such as pseudoknots, cannot be predicted by SCFGs.

However, even though the animal feedstuffs and competing industries have increased demands for fish meal, global production of this commodity has remained relatively stable over the last decade, and supplies are unlikely to improve (FAO, 2004) . Indeed, the increasing scarcity of suitable protein sources for human consumption may result in the use of industrial fish for the plate Aquaculture 257 (2006) 393 -399 www.elsevier.com/locate/aqua-online resulting in a further weakening in supplies (Craig and McLean, 2005) . Already, aquafeeds account for N 50% of variable operating costs of intensive aquaculture operations, with protein representing the most costly feed ingredient (Bassompierre et al., 1997) . If aquaculture is to continue to expand to meet global demands for seafood products, development of cost-effective and sustainable dietary formulations will be mandatory (Catacutan and Pagador, 2004) . This only can occur through significant reductions in the dependence of the aquafeed industry upon fish meal supplies. Because fish meal represents a finite resource and as it has become more expensive over time (FAO, 2004) , it is not surprising to find that the aquafeed industry has sought out alternative, less expensive, protein sources. For alternative or supplemental proteins to be useful however, they must possess certain characteristics. Alternative proteins must be competitively priced relative to fish meal on a unit protein basis. They cannot negatively impact fish performance (digestibility, growth, disease resistance, etc.) or product quality and must be commodities (i.e., traded internationally) (Hardy and Tacon, 2002) . As well, alternative proteins must not be environmentally degrading with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus discharge and should be easily handled, stored and amenable to pelleting. Due to the aforementioned restrictions, there exists, at present at least, only a limited number of potential candidates. These include the pulses, oilseeds, grains, rendered animal meals, processing discards and fishery by-catch. Soybean meal in particular represents one of the most widely used alternate protein sources employed by aquaculture, due to its global distribution, cost, relatively high digestibility, good amino acid profile and high protein content (Storebakken et al., 2000) . Nevertheless, soybean and other alternative protein meals each contain a variety of anti-nutritional factors that negatively impact production performance of cultured fish (Francis et al., 2001) .",16.14561697079061,7.6340453493760165

Hacking spends a considerable amount of time 2 getting to grips with a set of ideas that were around by the seventeenth century and perhaps earlier, which were concerned with ""possibility"" (as distinct from probability). These terms seem to have become a focus of dispute in the 18th century, with some scholars arguing that possibility is different from probability (e.g., Leibniz and Laplace), and others arguing that it is identical. Hacking relates this discussion to an earlier scholarly debate about de re and de dicto modes of language, where the former refers to statements about aspects of the world (e.g., ""it is possible for Daniel to get to San Francisco by noon"") and the latter about what can be said or known (e.g., ""it is possible that Daniel is there now""). Hacking seems to come down on the side of those who regard possibility and probability as equivalent. Indeed he links the de re mode with the aleatory aspect of probability (chance, and hence possibility, is a property of the world) and the de dicto mode with the epistemic aspect (i.e., an aspect of our knowledge of the world) though to my way of thinking the objectivesubjective distinction remains intact. 3 Despite the apparent simplicity of the two primary dimensions of the Hacking space many believe that this is still too complicated and have argued for an even more parsimonious interpretation of probability since a simpler semantics and avoidance of psychological issues should yield practical tools that are both more general and easier to use. In the most influential view probability is viewed as a universal measure that can represent all uncertainty and belief. The ""Bayesian"" probabilists have been particularly active in this area due to their wish to move away from a strictly frequentistic concept of probability based on empirical observations. The simplification is achieved in three moves. First, it is asserted that all uncertainty about a proposition can be represented by a single number representing a degree of belief in that proposition. This is conventionally a point in the [0, 1] interval 4 whose properties are defined by the probability axioms. Second, the aleatory-epistemic dimension is collapsed by treating all empirical chances as probabilities, and treating epistemic reasoning (e.g., reasoning based on deductive logics) as a special case of probabilistic reasoning in which only two degrees of belief are permitted, 1.0 and 0. These points are viewed as equivalent to ""true"" and ""false"" in classical logic. Third, the philosophical complications of the objective-subjective distinction are finessed by assuming that subjective probabilities are technically no different from objective ones and therefore subject to the same theorems. Claims that human judgement and decision-making may take place without use of explicit probabilities is discounted by insisting that all decision makers have a personal probability for all possible states of the world, which can be revealed by forcing the decision maker to gamble on alternative options.",16.667820208873245,7.37658447698957

The later restoration of a stronger policy drive (starting with BIOTECH 1) paired with greater accountability under the mandates of dedicated Commissioners, made a paradoxical evolution possible: continuity as a leading priority, but discontinuity in design and approaches. As far as life sciences are concerned, the continuous and welcome growth of biotechnology budgets, for a period at least, was overlaid by variable underpinning visions. While the old days had seen a management which tested their concepts at project level under the scrutiny of committees, the maturation period more recently was one of concept validation at entire programme level under the scrutiny of national governments through the leadership of Commissioners in charge. Typically, the European Framework programmes between FP2 and FP6 were periodically affected in both substance and procedures, depending on whether the political forces at that particular moment welcomed an objective-driven design or an instrument-driven design. The ever returning question preceding the renewal of entire programmes seems to have been that of the desired hierarchy of values: Will strategic objectives define implementation means, or vice versa?

A large scale facility can take multiple years and hundreds millions of dollars to build. Mammalian cell culture is the dominant production platform for mAb therapeutics. About half of the current marketed mAbs are expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Recombinant myelomas or hybridomas are still being used for antibody production, but their utility as a production platform is limited due to the low expression titer and instability of the cell lines. To reduce the cost of antibody production, other methods of antibody expression, such as bacteria, plants, transgenic animals (milk), eggs, and yeast, are being developed. Certolizumab pegol is an example of mAb (fragment) therapeutic made in a bacteria . However, antibodies produced in E. coli are not glycosylated and this severely limits its use as a manufacturing platform. Antibodies with specific human N-glycan structures have been expressed in glycoengineered lines of the yeast Pichia pastoris and its utility as a general platform for producing recombinant antibodies with human N-glycosylation is being developed (Li et al., 2006a; Lin et al., 2010) . Antibody has been expressed in engineered chicken eggs and in plants (Zhu et al., 2005; Cox et al., 2006) . Despite significant effort, cost saving alternative antibody manufacturing platforms is still lacking. This is in part due to the effect of the various expression hosts on antibody posttranslational modifications and the low production titers. There is a clear need for innovation and technology breakthroughs in reducing the manufacturing cost of therapeutic antibodies. This is not limited to the choice of expression hosts. Purification, formulation, storage, and other steps in the entire manufacturing process need to be improved to bring antibody therapeutics in a more cost competitive position against small molecule drugs.",23.20384687392471,12.744491986165396

The policy framing and disease mitigation approach focused on preventing an external incursion of H5N1 and less on the local and regional contextual factors that could potentially influence its transmission, establishment and spread. This is typical of approaches to disease control. They emphasize preventing 'contamination' and are sometimes uncritical of 'configuration' or context. 160 In Zambia, decision-makers focused on mitigating disease contamination, as exemplified for instance, by the institution of a partial poultry and poultry product import ban even from countries unaffected by H5N1. 161 But this was a valid concern, given Zambia's prioritization of disease freedom for the purposes of trade. Zambia's National Response Plan for avian and pandemic influenza prevention and control lists five potential introduction routes for H5N1; live bird imports; poultry product imports; illegal poultry and poultry product trade; returning travellers previously in direct or indirect contact with infected poultry or poultry premises overseas; and aquatic migratory birds.

From the onset, there was a strong sense among some veterinary stakeholders that H5N1 was alien to Zambia. An example of this viewpoint is provided in the words of a senior veterinary member of Zambia's Task Force on Avian Influenza, 'We don't have avian influenza as you know. It is an exotic disease to us, but it is a possible emerging disease' (Interview 4). Linked to this was a second narrative framing, which presented H5N1 is an infectious agent of poultry with limited zoonotic potential. This narrative therefore framed H5N1 as a predominantly poultry health concern, described as 'basically . . . more of an animal disease which then moves into human beings' (Interview 2). This narrative also justified the need for veterinary leadership in developing any prevention measure to be taken, and reflected the broader international veterinary narrative on H5N1, a problem that required the use of standardized, time-tested technical veterinary approaches to animal disease control. 115 The problem with this narrative is that in Zambia, at least, the country's veterinary priority lay on controlling cattle diseases. For decision-makers, poultry production was a low priority, 'When you look at our focus, we are more oriented towards cattle. So most of the diseases that affect cattle are given priority. Probably you will look at it and what you get is that birds or bird diseases are not so significant or are not so associated with major economic losses. I think, it's not just because it is avian influenza and it is not there, it's because its poultry and it's not so significant. It's not written but it is implied in the way we do things.' (Interview 4, MACO). Another respondent put it this way, 'I mean you have to remember that they [cattle diseases] already exist in Zambia. We have FMD, it's spreading like fire, ok?

However, this approach has limited production capacity and is expensive. In contrast, the production of rHP in milk of transgenic cattle is a safe and less-expensive alternative with the advantage of better protein output (Brink et al., 2000) . Ebert et al. (1991) reported the generation of two transgenic goats that expressed a variant of human tissue plasminogen activator (htPA). The milk from one of these contained enzymatically active longer acting tissue plasminogen activator (LAtPA) at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. Economic comparison of production costs of htPA through bacterial fermentation, mammalian cell culture, and cow transgenic technology estimates the cost per gram of htPA to be 20,000, 10,000, and 10 US$, respectively (Karatzas and Turner, 1997) .

Production of novel antiviral medications cannot begin until the unique genetic features of the offending pathogen are identified. This is not to say, however, that likely candidates for novel and highly virulent infection cannot be identified in advance and that production of vaccine and medicines with at least some probabilistic efficacy cannot proceed, as has been seen with development of neutralizing antibody responses in human subjects given a prototype H5N1 vaccine. 130 An influenza vaccination, however, is far more cost effective than antiviral treatment or prohylaxis. 105, 131 There is substantial evidence that dilution of a vaccine provides at least some measure of protection, 132-134 even for the experimental H5N1 vaccine, 130 although antibody titers definitely rise with increasing dosage to levels deemed to give adequate (Ͼ50% of the vaccinated population) immunity.

Therefore, the emphasis should be put more in the availability of communication platforms for the detectors to transmit the captured signals to the decision makers rather than on complex, sophisticated (and expensive) 'fusion hubs' and filtering mechanisms. Ultimately, the successful signal detection depends more on the 'collective mind' and the shared sense of purpose within the organisation rather than on predetermined repertoires and databases. Consistent with the social exchange theory principles discussed earlier in the paper, the first and most basic stage of crisis signal detection may simply be the sharing of time sensitive information and existing knowledge in an opportune fashion (for example the DHS's ""See Something -Say Something"" campaign for terrorism). However, social exchange theory alone cannot capture the complexity of signal detection since, at more advanced levels of maturity, signal detection and the 'collective mind' move from the opportune transmission of 'what is' to identifying 'what could possibly be' and where the signals of known and unknown crises could be captured.",36.788529128711886,16.110608245738856

Paul Sabatier has compiled some of the available frameworks for conducting descriptive policy analyses (Sabatier, 1993a) . One of the criteria used for selecting frameworks is that they address the roles of conflicting values and interests, information flows, institutional arrangements and variations in socioeconomic environment on the policy process. The following frameworks were identified as useful for describing decision-making within a given political system or set of institutional arrangements: the stages heuristic, institutional rational choice, multiple-streams framework, punctuated equilibrium framework and the advocacy coalition framework. The last framework, the advocacy coalition framework (ACF), was proposed by Sabatier and suggests that decision making occurs in a policy subsystem involving individuals from a variety of public and private organizations who are actively concerned with a policy problem. Within this subsystem, individuals aggregate into advocacy coalitions based on shared ideologies and beliefs. The success of the coalitions in translating their beliefs into policy is dependent upon their resources (money, expertise, legal authority and size). Policy brokers attempt to mediate the conflict between the various advocacy coalitions. This process of conflict and mediation eventually results in policy outputs by the governing structures in the subsystem (Sabatier, 1987; Sabatier, 1993b ). The ACF model has been identified as being effective in describing decision-making in a variety of policy sectors (Jenkins-Smith & Sabatier, 1994) .",29.886659502697654,12.428480535645717

The idea of a continuously evolving point of reference for detectors (and decision makers) to facilitate the recognition of signal patterns or even enable them define a case as an emerging crisis was further elaborated by Mitroff (2004) who suggested that organizations need ""world-class Crisis Learning Centers"" (p. 20) to study patterns associated with past crises (own and others'), distil critical lessons from them and ensure that these will shape the organization's crisis planning in order to reduce the potential for future crises. Clearly, however, the cost implications of such an endeavour make it rather a desirable 'add-on' rather than an essential element for the signal detection system. The proposition of an industry-level (or UNWTO-level) knowledge database appears to be more realistic; however, there are still important practicalities to be taken into consideration, such as the difficulties in the codification and storage of complex multidimensional crisis information (e.g., the 2004 hurricane Katrina or the 2011 Tohoku earthquake) or the possible bias in terms of responsive action that the information retrieval system may cause as a result of this codification (not every crisis is the same crisis).

Background: Secondhand smoke (SHS) is a major preventable cause of death and disease. Many countries have enacted laws banning smoking in public places as part of their strategy to decrease the ill effects of smoking. In some countries this strategy appears to be successful in reducing smoking and in reducing levels of non-smoker's exposure to SHS. In recent years some countries have banned smoking in pubs and bars, the last public venues where it was still allowed. Subsequent studies measuring SHS have shown dramatic drop in SHS following the ban. In 1983, a law banning smoking in public places in Israel was enacted and amendments to the basic law were added over the years. The latest amendment came into effect in 2007, adding pubs and bars to the list of public places in which it is prohibited to smoke. Objective: To measure the adherence of bars and pubs with the law banning smoking in them, and to identify variables that may predict adherence to the law. Methods: This study includes data collection from two sources.

Machine Learning Approaches for Prediction of Mouse Life Span,"Machine learning algorithms are valuable tools for the generation of predictive models and identification of complex patterns between variables. These methods are used to predict an outcome of interest based on a set of predictor variables, and are especially well suited to large data sets for which least-squares regression approaches can be problematic. The approach is to present algorithms with a set of training cases, each of which consists of measurements on a set of predictor variables and a class label. For example, training cases may consist of mice measured for body weight, tail length, and body fat percentage (predictor variables), and each mouse is labeled as ''short-lived'' or ''long-lived.'' Within this framework, predictive models are generated as the algorithm ''learns'' a relationship between predictor variables and class labels. The manner by which learning occurs varies among algorithms, but may involve building a decision tree structure, identifying appropriate weights in a neural network, or identifying a maximal margin hyperplane that distinguishes training examples of different classes (20) . These approaches have most often been applied in the context of handwritten digit recognition, speech pattern identification, and recognition of facial images (21, 22) . In recent years, however, machine learning has made important contributions to the biological sciences as well, and has been used to annotate gene sequence data (23) , diagnose disease (24) , and identify compounds with drug activity (25, 26) . Currently available methods range from classical approaches, such as linear and quadratic discriminant function classifiers, to more recently developed methods, which include decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines (SVMs).",22.580764101233306,11.092175738215623

This dependence on vector control is due to the frequent lack of access to safe or effective treatment. However, even when treatment exists and is available, it can be costly and complex, especially in later stages of disease progression. Communities impacted by EReNTDs often lack the necessary health care delivery infrastructure to support integrated prevention and treatment approaches that include screening, diagnosis, treatment, and case management, the absence of which can translate into a significant global burden of disease (8, 56) . Hence, encouraging and funding health care institutions, clinics, and community health facilities to engage in surveillance, prevention, and treatment programs may help to reduce the risk and aid in decreasing the incidence of EReNTDs (34, 48) . Specifically, ensuring that clinics in areas of endemicity are adequately stocked with medications that are low-cost and accessible may encourage infected individuals to seek care (60) . Misdiagnosis of infectious diseases may be prevented if programs are initiated to ensure that rural providers (including traditional healers and those who practice ethnomedicine) are capable of identifying early symptoms of infection and have proper training to either treat or refer cases (286, 287) . This can be enhanced if efforts are made to increase accessibility of basic literature and education that aid in making an accurate EReNTD diagnosis (288) . Providing periodic forums for feedback from community health workers may prioritize more cost-efficient primary prevention strategies over strategies related to the clinical management of symptoms (289, 290) . However, managers of rural clinics should also be encouraged to facilitate and reward workers for suggesting innovative ideas about how to provide better care for patients infected with EReNTDs (291) .",21.868992494465502,9.626433752400237

In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous humanenvironment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertisebased decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers. To combat current and future EIDs, expertise should be based on a multi-sectorial approach, promotion of collegiality and continuously adaptation to the evolving nature of EIDs.

Thereby, pandemic mitigation has to be done amidst a limited knowledge of disease and population dynamics, constrained infrastructure, shortage of effective clinical treatments, and to-be-proven resource allocation policies. This challenge, faced during the recent H1N1 outbreak, has been acknowledged by WHO 9 and echoed by the Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 10, 11 The existing literature on pandemic influenza (PI) modeling aims to address various complex aspects of the pandemic evolution process including: (i) underlying spatio-temporal structure, (ii) contact dynamics and disease transmission, (iii) disease progression, and (iv) development of mitigation strategies. A comprehensive decision-aid model for containment and mitigation has to invariably consider all of the above aspects: it must incorporate the mechanism of disease progression, from initial infection, to the asymptomatic phase, manifestation of symptoms, and a final health outcome; [12] [13] [14] it must also consider the population dynamics, including individual susceptibility 15, 16 and transmissibility, 12, [17] [18] [19] as well as the behavioral factors that affect infection generation and disease progression; [20] [21] [22] [23] finally, it must incorporate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures, including vaccination, antiviral therapy, social distancing and travel restrictions, and use of low-cost measures, such as face masks and hand washing. [24] [25] [26] [27] In recent years, the models for PI containment and mitigation have focused on integrating therapeutical and nontherapeutical measures in search for synergistic strategies, aimed at better resource utilization. Most of these approaches implement a form of social distancing to reduce infection exposure, followed by application of pharmaceutical means. A number of significant contributions has been made in this challenging area. 1, 25, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] One of the most notable among the recent efforts is a 2006-07 initiative by the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) 33 which examined independent models of large-scale PI spread for rural areas of Asia, 34,35 U.S. and U.K., 36, 37 and the city of Chicago. 38 MIDAS cross-validated the models by simulating the city of Chicago, with 8.6 M inhabitants, and implementing targeted layered containment. 39, 40 The research findings of MIDAS and other institutions 14, 25 were used in a recent ""Modeling Community Containment for Pandemic Influenza"" report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), to formulate a set of recommendations for mitigating PI at a local level. 41 These recommendations were used in a pandemic preparedness guidance developed jointly by CDC, HHS, and other federal agencies. 42 At the same time, the IOM report points out several limitations of the MIDAS models, observing that ""because of the significant constraints placed on the models"" being considered by policy makers, ""the scope of the models should be expanded."" The IOM recommends ""to adapt or develop decision-aid models that can ... provide real-time feedback during an epidemic."" The report also emphasizes that ""future modeling efforts should incorporate broader outcome measures ... to include the costs and benefits of intervention strategies"". 41 It can indeed be observed that practically all existing approaches focus on assessment of apriori defined strategies; virtually none of the synergistic decision models are capable of ""learning"", ie, adapting to changes in the pandemic course, yet predicting them, to generate a dynamic optimal strategy. Such a strategy is advantageous in its ability to be state-dependent, ie, as being formed dynamically as the pandemic spreads, by selecting the optimal combination of available mitigation options at each decision epoch, based on the present pandemic state.",25.002326119020637,11.645537092115749

The scheme of PSF is shown in Fig. 5 .1. In other words, when three streams progress independently and are combined at critical junctures, this combination creates an opportunity for agenda change. The problem stream means that policy decision-makers become interested in a specific policy problem among various problems. The stream of politics consists of the national mood, public opinion, election results, replacement of administration, lopsided or ideological distribution in a council, and pressure of interest groups.

Most of these factors originate from the nature of the virus itself. Examples include: (1) viruses that exhibit extensive genetic variations (eg, influenza); (2) viruses that evolved multiple mechanisms for evading host immune detection and response (eg, HCV and HSV); (3) viruses that integrate their genomes in that of the host (eg, HIV); (4) viruses that are capable of developing latency (HSV). Some factors stem from the inability of the host to protect against infection (and reinfection) due to the inadequacy of the immune response (eg, RSV). Other factors that are unrelated to both virus and host include the lack of animal models that are suitable for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine candidates and economical considerations. Early antiviral vaccine success stories (eg, smallpox, rabies, and yellow fever) were based on empirical efforts in which vaccines were derived from either a live attenuated form of the virus or inactivated whole virus. It is clear that such approaches are not enough to address the current challenges. Developing an effective vaccine against many of the currently challenging viruses would require an integrative effort from scientists representing various disciplines. For example, public health studies would be needed to assess the disease burden in different populations in order to define the most vulnerable ones. Virological studies would be important for generating viral vaccine strains that lack immune evasion capacity, for example. Immunologists would define which arms of the immune response are needed to achieve protection. Bioinformaticians would need to work very closely with immunologists in order to transform high-throughput data and analyses into concrete, useful knowledge. Structural analyses would help in identifying important immune targets and how to rationally design immunogens that elicit maximal immune responses to such targets. Vaccinologists would then assess vaccine candidates in preclinical and clinical trials. Finally, engaging the pharmaceutical industry would be essential for scaling up the production of the final product.",21.02190898321582,11.933490521330432

Farming of transgenic plants will open up the possibility of expanding the production of the target gene product with very little investment compared to the conventional methods. Targeted expression to seeds and the oil bodies serve a different function. When the protein need to be transported from its place of production or stored for longer, it can be expressed in seeds and for an easy purification, the proteins can be targeted to oil bodies [30, [49] [50] [51] .

It is a key factor for all drug treatment, though here we will discuss it in relation to mental illness. The legal basis of the doctrine of informed consent is also a philosophical one, in that persons have a right to privacy and bodily integrity, and that, generally, only the person can decide whether to be treated and in what manner. The issue of competence revolves around an assessment of whether an individual has the mental capacity to make an autonomous decision, to understand the facts, to appreciate the consequences of making a particular decision, and to be consistent in their decision-making about it. Competence, however, is a legal term, and is binary; one is either competent or incompetent. Since the ability to perform a certain action, such as making a decision about medical care, is task-specific, the notion of capacity is preferable to the more global notion of competence. In this sense, even an individual who has been declared legally incompetent with respect to his or her financial affairs, for example, is not necessarily so incapacitated that he or she cannot make a decision about how much medication can comfortably be tolerated. Even when it has been determined that an individual is incapable of making a particular decision, protestations against continuing even indicated, standard treatment (let alone innovative or investigational therapy) should be taken seriously and weighed carefully against the expected benefits and the amount of time required to manifest them. Alternative approaches should be considered under these circumstances, considering likely benefits to the patient and the inherent cost of forced treatment to the patient's well-being.

A number of studies have documented enhanced protein production following cotransfection with baculoviruses expressing chaperone proteins, which are known to aid in the folding and modification of newly synthesized proteins. The expression of correctly assembled Shaker potassium channels in Sf9 cells was enhanced by coexpression of the calcium-binding, lectin-chaperone calnexin together with substitution of the polyhedrin promoter with the weaker basic protein promoter to drive expression of the ion channel 42 . Coexpression of calreticulin promoted the production of properly folded human lipoprotein lipase 43 and HLA-DR4 tetramers 44 . Another approach has been to coexpress the chaperone Hsp70 and its cofactors Hsdj and Hsp40.

Indeed, people tend to ascribe lower importance to outcomes in the remote future, which is accounted for in project evaluations by applying a corrective factor on monetary flows, called ""discounting of utility"" (Samuelson 1937) . By lowering the weight of future gains and costs in decision-making, this discounting minimizes the weight of sustainability concerns in public decisions and puts a strain on present investment for conservation (Dietz and Neumayer 2007) . In this regard, framing environmental issues as catastrophes and major threats, such as emerging diseases, contributes to a perception of emergency among decision-makers and among the wider public regarding behavioral change. Two cognitive biases in decision-making are relevant here, as studied by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) . First, losses are perceived more acutely than gains, meaning that the possibility of smaller losses may outweigh that of larger gains. Second, low probabilities are commonly overestimated, which in the present case leads to overestimating the importance of a topic like ""emerging pandemic threats"". Moreover, negative framings are known to be stronger psychological attractors (Bolls et al. 2001; Ferreira et al. 2011) . These fundaments are exploited by a line of research on panic effects in decision-making and behavior (Lerner et al. 2015) . Nevertheless, it may be proposed that decisions spurred by a framing of alert and emergency will tend to favour actions with rapid expected results (e.g., vaccination campaigns). In a context of financial resource scarcity and allocation choices, this may be at the expense of more long-term oriented actions (e.g., more sustainable land use), which would have needed a distinct framing to be pushed forward.",19.962005040255598,9.333355040771359

The definition of adequate may vary. For example, an otherwise healthy animal with mild to moderate weakness after acute blood loss may be allowed to recover spontaneously. A severely ill patient with the same degree of anemia caused by surgical blood loss may recover more quickly with fewer complications if transfused. One must avoid the temptation of arbitrary transfusion at a given Hct. Several factors are considered, including the cause and severity of anemia, expectation of further blood loss, alternative treatment options, and the time of onset of anemia. Typically, anemia caused by lack of red cell production is slow in onset and compensatory mechanisms are functioning by the time the anemia is severe. These mechanisms include increased cardiac output and pulmonary ventilation, and in some species, increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). Thus, oxygen delivery is maximized and sedentary patients may show only mild clinical signs despite a Hct of less than 10%. Conversely, the acutely anemic patient may require red cell support at a higher Hct. In fact a patient with acute hemorrhage may die with a normal Hct. The decision to transfuse also depends upon the overall evaluation of the patient, especially cardiac, pulmonary, and renal function. The availability of alternative treatment such as iron replacement after chronic blood loss may avert the need for blood. Ventricular function is depressed in animals when the Hct is less than 30%, however, oxygen extraction and central venous Po 2 remain normal until the Hct reaches 20% (Messmer, 1975) .",20.114752879881557,10.822347381611957

Models have been used to test intervention effectiveness during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and a potential H5N1 pandemic. [46] [47] [48] Models that showed that preventing air travel and closing schools would have minimal impact on the size of the epidemic informed policy in the US and other countries. Individual-based models can be used to examine the impact of interventions on inequalities. Outputs can be measured by geographic area or wealth quintile, thus quantifying policy impact on not only reducing disease burden overall, but also on reducing inequalities in disease burden. 49, 50 Funding agencies should invest in computational modeling education programs in low-and lower-middle-income countries, similar to investments that the NIH has made in the US. 51 The last point becomes especially salient when decisions need to be made quickly by policymakers in a country. Policymakers are more likely to work with and trust researchers from their own country. Investing in social, epidemiologic, and computational public health research capabilities in low-and lower-middle-income countries will enhance understanding of social inequalities in disease burden and enable policies that reduce these inequalities, as well as disease overall, ultimately enhancing global health security. Although its outcome is not yet known, one example of this is the partnership among the CDC, China CDC, Suzhou CDC, Suzhou Children's Hospital, and Fudan University to examine the economic burden of seasonal influenza among children in China as part of an effort to address vaccine policy in that country. 52 Meeting the goal of ''responding rapidly and effectively to biological threats by improving global access to medical and non-medical countermeasures'' 3 demands that we address the major challenge of fair access to antivirals and vaccines. Farmer et al 53 discuss key steps to expanding access to cancer treatment in poor countries with a 2-pronged strategy: global pricing and procurement strategies in which multiple countries negotiate together for reduced prices, and careful planning so that treatment reaches resourcepoor regions within these countries. A similar mindset is required in pandemic planning. Vaccine donation and distribution systems coordinated by WHO during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic were designed to ensure access to vaccines at a basic level in low-income countries. However, in the WHO's evaluation of their H1N1 vaccine deployment efforts, they identified multiple challenges. 54 Although 122.5 million doses were pledged for donation, in fact those dosages would have covered only 10% of the populations of those countries eligible for donation. Given that eligible countries are low-and lower-middle-income countries, the likelihood of inadequate vaccine for populations already experiencing health inequalities is high. In the review of other criteria for distribution, there is no explicit recognition of inequalities that could contribute to greater disease burden among socially disadvantaged populations.",19.125385294647796,10.506856874229634

We further illustrate how dynamic policies can be defined and optimized for the control of a novel viral pathogen, where a policy maker must decide (i) when to employ or lift a transmission-reducing intervention (e.g. school closure) and (ii) how to prioritize population members for vaccination when a limited quantity of vaccines first become available.

However, the difficulties associated with standardizing and combining a range of data sources -each involving potentially dissimilar unique identifiers, data structures, languages and semantics -limits the development of animal health geodata warehouses and results in bias. Data adapters (applications that convert attributes of one database into attributes compatible with another database) are integral to the creation of such information systems as they can be used to relate diverse databases through the identification of fields containing equivalent information (Perez et al., 2011) .",24.151219707408366,11.376946389265443

Although challenge models are good predictive models of acute exacerbations of COPD, there are ethical considerations associated with inducing exacerbations in subjects with COPD. Therefore, safety boards may be advised to only consider subjects with mild COPD for inclusion in these studies. Healthy subjects could be used as an alternative, when determining the effects of a developmental drug's mechanism of action on lung inflammation. The LPS and O 3 models have been used successfully in healthy subjects. [13] [14] [15] 22, 24, [26] [27] [28] As these models represent the local inflammation in the lung during an exacerbation, and test the mechanism of action of potential novel drugs, these data may be used for future decision making. The LPS challenge model is the best validated model in subjects with COPD. Pharmaceutical companies have used LPS models as a means to establish proof of principle early during the clinical development process, because they are relatively simple to perform and have few adverse events. This model is cost effective because it can be conducted in healthy subjects, who are easy to recruit. LPS challenge data, whether positive or negative, can provide valuable information to aid investment decision making. One disadvantage of the LPS model is that it is a model of lung inflammation, but not of the disease state, thus preclinical validation of the developmental drug's effects on LPS pathways is essential.

Werner et al.26 estimated the OPEX and COGS for a 250 kg/year CHO facility assuming a 1g/L titer and 70% yield in downstream processing as $65M/year and $260/g, respectively. From Figs. 4, and 5, adjusting for an improvement in yield from 65% to 70% in downstream processing and reduction in production capacity from 300 kg/year to 250 kg/year, a similar transient plant-based production facility is estimated to have an OPEX of $33M/year and COGS of $131/g, assuming an expression level of 1 g/kg FW. Thus, the plant-based facility is estimated to reduce the OPEX and COGS by about 50% over the CHO facility, even without taking inflation into consideration. In a more recent paper,27 the downstream processing costs for a mAb produced using a conventional mammalian cell culture process at a high production capacity (1,000 kg/year) for a titer of 1 g/L was estimated to be $232/g. Even at a much lower production capacity (600 kg/year), the plant-based system thus has a COGS of ∼$99/g, including both upstream and downstream process operations, representing a >50% reduction in manufacturing costs. While there are a number of published reports of low COGS for mAbs produced in mammalian cell cultures, many of these estimates are for facilities with very large production capacities. For example, for mAbs produced in conventional batch CHO bioreactors, Kelly28 estimated COGS to range from $134/g at 1,000 kg/year to $26/g at 10,000 kg/year, Walther et al.23 predicts a COGS of $22/g at 1,537 kg/year, and Petrides et al.29 estimates a COGS of $86/g at 1,580 kg/year and a CAPEX of $512M, including startup and validation, in 2013 USD. These production capacities for a single facility are at the high end, considering the total production of 31 full-length mAbs produced in mammalian cell culture was 8,182 kg in 2013.1 MAbs, as well as other biotherapeutics, tend to be developed for smaller patient populations, and will require a large number of small to intermediate size (10 to 100 kg/yr) production facilities.

For the Base Case scenario, a production capacity of 300 kg mAb/year and expression level of 1 g mAb/kg fresh weight (FW) of plant biomass after standard gene optimization was assumed, along with a recovery of 65% in the downstream process. Expression levels above 1 g of mAb per kilogram of plant biomass have been observed in our laboratory, and pilot-scale experiments confirm this as a conservative assumption. Recovery of 60% to 80% has been reported for mAb production systems; 21 therefore, a conservative recovery of 65% was assumed. Alternative facilities were simulated by varying the expression level from 0.25 g mAb/kg FW to 5 g mAb/kg FW, keeping the production level at 300 kg mAb/year. The production capacity was modeled in the range from 25 kg mAb/year to 600 kg mAb/year at an expression level of 1 g mAb/kg FW. CAPEX and COGS were determined over these ranges. The general model can be used to investigate a wide range of “what if” scenarios to investigate the effect of process assumptions (such as age of plants used for agroinfiltration, ratio of agrobacteria to biomass in the agroinfiltration step, resin binding capacity and replacement frequency) economic assumptions (e.g., cost of utilities, labor, major equipment).

However, they showed that by doubling the biomass productivity and expression level, improving downstream yield from 54% to 63%, and increasing the production capacity to 20 kg HRP/year, the COGS was lowered to $611/g, resulting in an internal rate of return (IRR) of 26% for a selling price of $1,250/g.

Tusé et al. presented a techno-economic analysis for the production of butyrylcholinesterase, a medical countermeasure against organophosphate nerve agents, in a large-scale PMP facility utilizing transient agroinfiltration of indoor hydroponically grown N. benthamiana.18 The facility was designed for lower production (25 kg purified butyrylcholinesterase/year), lower expression level (0.5 g/kg FW) and lower downstream recovery (20%) than for our mAb Base Case. However, the COGS of $1,180/g obtained in that study agrees within 5% of the predictions made by our model ($1,140/g) when adjusted for production level, expression level and downstream recovery using adjustment factors obtained from Figs. 4 and 5. In the Tusé et al. study, the downstream portion of the process accounted for about the same percentage of the CAPEX (61%) compared with the current study (65%).",22.691381347089692,8.797304871348926

Furthermore, to extend the exploration of pharmacological agents that are neuroprotective, markers of axonal transection and neuronal death should be included. Another area of importance is remyelination. Injured axons are unable to remyelinate lending further support that neuroprotective therapies should be an important part of remyelination therapies. Additionally, unmyelinated axons are more vulnerable to injury than myelinated axons. This suggests that when an axon becomes demyelinated therapeutic interventions that promote timely remyelination will prevent axonal injury. To explore these avenues, other in vivo models for demyelination and remyelination may be used (i.e., cuprizone and lysolecithin). The method described herein focused on assessing neuroprotection by quantifying myelin loss. For the evaluation of remyelination the number of progenitor cells as well as their ability to proliferate and mature would also be important to investigate. With the mention of these alternative models, one must also consider different models of encephalitis that are virally mediated. There are two well-characterized RNA viral models that produce myelin loss: one is Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, a non-enveloped Picornaviridae virus, and the other is mouse hepatitis virus, a member of the Coronaviridae virus family 25,26.",20.915754979784396,9.017757498301354

This may attenuate C3b-directed targeting, uptake, and presentation of WNV in lymphoid tissues (2, 4, 27). Alternatively, C3b engagement of CR3 may promote an appropriate cytokine environment for antiviral T cell priming: production of IFNγ and IL-12 were reduced by treatment of human monocytes with CR3 blocking antibodies or natural CR3 ligands (57).",12.905092555806366,7.580782583836579

These examples are: the Rajneeshee attack with a contaminated salad in Oregon (1984); contamination with anthrax spores by Aum Shinrykio (Japan) and the anthrax letters in the US (2001). The suspicion that Al Qaida might be preparing a bioterrorist attack was found after the occupation of Afghanistan. Three examples in more than 25 years!

Following up on their initial findings [58], research led by Mamoru Watanabe demonstrated that NS4B inhibits IFN-β production and IRF-3 phosphorylation stimulated by poly(dA:dT) treatment, or STING, MAVS or ΔRIG-I over-expression [10]. Ding et al. independently made similar observations, and also showed that NS4B blocks type III IFN induction during SeV infection [13]. NS4B did not inhibit IFN-β production stimulated by over-expression of IRF-3 or NF-κB, suggesting that NS4B acts upstream of IRF-3 [13]. The NS3/4A protease complex did not block STING-mediated IFN-β induction or IRF-3 phosphorylation [10], confirming that NS3/4A and NS4B antagonise IFN production by distinct mechanisms. In addition, NS4B, but not NS3/4A, inhibited IFN production induced by over-expression of a MAVS construct that mimics the product of NS3/4A-mediated MAVS cleavage [10], [13]. This MAVS cleavage product loses its ability to dimerise and localise to the mitochondrial membrane [59], [60], [61], but residual levels of IFN-β induction are still detectable [10], [13], [59]. Therefore, HCV has evolved distinct and additive mechanisms involving NS4B and the NS3/4A protease for blocking IFN induction via RIG-I and STING.",11.563000615602572,6.632665552355889

It has been shown that the quality of the predictions breaks down in cases where sequence identity is <60% (26). On the other hand, these methods can also be applied to improve the consensus structure prediction in Sankoff-like approaches.

Physiologically, mitral regurgitation is a load-dependent murmur, such that severity of regurgitation can vary markedly depending on the minute-to-minute hemodynamics of the patient. Moreover, MR can be directional, and therefore certain types of MR may simply not have murmurs at a single auscultation location, like the cardiac apex.

Early in an epidemic, particularly when in the presence of a novel pathogen like SARS-CoV-2, there is typically a large amount of uncertainty around most epidemiological parameters, especially R 0 [9, 23] . This uncertainty is the result of several factors, including lack of reliable data on the true number of cases, differences in the formulations and assumptions underlying the statistical models used to estimate R 0 , and the geographic heterogeneity of the disease spreading patterns. This uncertainty around the value of R 0 should also be carried over to the estimate of the optimal time for initiating social distancing. Hence, assuming the true R 0 lies within a range (e.g., 95% confidence intervals), the estimation of the optimal t 0 should account for this uncertainty. Moreover, if a (Bayesian posterior) distribution is available for R 0 , then one could also get a distribution for the optimal t 0 , which would in turn allow to compute the probability that the optimal t 0 is within a given range, or lower/higher than a given time of interest (e.g., two weeks from now). Then, it would be up to the decision makers to determine what level of uncertainty is considered acceptable in order to proceed with a given social distancing strategy. Of note, if the level of uncertainty on R 0 is very large and a decision needs to be made promptly, it is arguably better to initiate social distancing sooner, as opposed to later, than the optimal t 0 inferred from the available data; therefore, a conservative approach could be to assume R 0 is equal to the upper bound of its %95 confidence interval, and compute the corresponding (shorter)",21.30056167805002,9.378212461941759

Only viable treatment at the moment is symptomatic and there is a desperate need for developing therapeutics to counter COVID-19. Recently, the proteomics sequences of 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus became available through Metagenomic RNA sequencing of a patient in Wuhan. 4, 15 WH-Human 1 is 89.1% similar to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses. 4 With this sequence available, it is possible to find potential inhibitory antibodies by scanning thousands of antibody sequences and discovering the neutralizing ones [16] [17] [18] . However, this requires very expensive and time-consuming experimentation to discover the inhibitory responses to Corona virus in a timely manner. In addition, computational and physics-based models require the bound crystal structure of antibody-antigen complex, however; only a few of these structures have become available. 19, 20, 21, 22 In the case of COVID-19, the bound antigen-antibody crystal structure is not available to-date 23, 24 . Given this challenge and the fact that ML models require a large amount of data, the ML approach should rely on the sequences of the antibody-antigen rather than the crystal structures 25 .",22.02621387724606,9.254101405040272

Here, we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters to inform epidemiologists, public health officials, and policy makers. We show preliminary results from a survey of over 58,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Preliminary analysis shows that in neighborhoods with confirmed COVID-19 patient history, more responders report on COVID-19 associated symptoms, demonstrating the potential utility of our approach for detection of outbreaks.

It is observed that the reduction of mobility due to the confinement of the population has a highly nonlinear effect on the reduction of the epidemic. This makes the task of policy makers notoriously difficult, as they need to design realistic, implementable, confinement measures that reduce the impact of the epidemic sufficiently within the shortest time frame possible. If the interventions planned are too weak, the epidemic will not cease and the surge capacity of healthcare systems will be surpassed, leaving many individuals requiring hospitalization out of the attention they need. Furthermore, once policy makers realize the insufficiency of the interventions put in place, the epidemic may have spread up to a point such that only the most severe interventions will be of real use. On the other side, implementing very strict confinement measures from an early stage would give governments a much needed time to prepare against the attack of the disease, but would most likely take a huge toll in the economy, and consequently, in the population.",15.532053537257,9.48174960561655
