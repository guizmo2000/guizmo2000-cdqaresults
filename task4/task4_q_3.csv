Although rodents have served as invaluable models for studying SCI mechanisms and therapeutic development, larger mammals, in particular non-human primates, share a closer size, neuroanatomy, and physiology to humans. Importantly, their larger size provides a more relevant platform for drug development, bioengineering inventions, and electrophysiological and rehabilitation studies. Nonetheless, both small and large animal models of SCI have limitations in their ability to predict the outcome in human SCI. One important factor is high degree of variability in the nature of SCI incidence, severity and location of the injury in human SCI, while in laboratory animal models, these variabilities are less (36) . Values acquired by clinical scoring systems such as ASIA or Frankel scoring systems lack the consistency of the data acquired from laboratory settings, which makes the translation of therapeutic interventions from experimental to clinical settings challenging (36) . A significant effect from an experimental treatment in consistent laboratory settings may not be reproducible in clinical settings due to high variability and heterogeneity in human populations and their injuries (36) . To date, several pharmacological and cellular preclinical discoveries have led to human clinical trials based on their efficacy in improving the outcomes of SCI in small animal models. However, the majority of these trials failed to reproduce the same efficacy in human SCI. Thus, in pre-clinical studies, animal models, and study designs should be carefully chosen to reflect the reality of clinical setting as closely as possible (36) . Larger animals provide the opportunity to refine promising therapeutic strategies prior to testing in human SCI; however, their higher cost, need for specialized facilities and small subject (sample) size have limited their use in SCI research (50) . Thus, rodents are currently the most commonly employed models for preclinical discoveries and therapeutic development, while the use of larger animals is normally pursued for late stage therapies that have shown efficacy and promise in small animal models.

Human-to-human transmission is common in Bangladesh and has also been documented in India. 55 Several species of pteropid fruit bats are known to be host reservoirs of NiV, with accumulating evidence that both NiV and other paramyxoviruses can circulate worldwide in bats. [54] [55] [56] The high fatality rate, direct infection from natural reservoirs, infection following amplification in susceptible domestic livestock such as pigs, documented human-to-human transmission, and the potential ability to transverse the globe, all emphasise the pandemic potential of NiV. 56 There are no clinically approved vaccines against NiV, however, one therapeutic approach (monoclonal antibody therapy) has recently completed a phase I clinical trial with results still to be reported. 57 While monoclonal antibody treatment may be efficacious in a short window post-exposure, this treatment option is not suitable for large-scale use, and as such, vaccine development is a key research focus for the prevention of NiV-mediated disease. Advantageously, there are a number of animal models of NiV infection which are used in vaccine development programs and are considered to sufficiently mirror NiV-induced pathogenesis observed in humans, e.g. the hamster, ferret and African Green Monkey (AGM) models.

Cluster density is equal to the number of elements in a cluster divided by their average ligand root mean square deviation (RMSD). The higher CD value implies greater accuracy. Ligand RMSD value shows the differentiation measure between cluster elements. As a guideline; RMSD < 3.0 Å means high accuracy; RMSD � 3.0 and � 5.5 Å means medium accuracy and RMSD > 5.5 Å means low accuracy [88] . Herein, the RMSD and CD of the best-simulated models were selected for the analysis. The best model, which has the highest CD value, is not necessarily the top-ranked model, because, in some cases, peptides were not attached to their binding site properly. Thus, these malformed models were excluded from the analysis. It is important to note that, due to the different frequency of MHC alleles in human populations, the equal CD value of different MHC alleles, don't have equal value regarding population coverage. Thus, to involve the effect of population coverage, the CD value of every model was multiplied by its allele population coverage (divided by hundreds for more facility) to obtain a weighted index. Then, the sum of all HLA-I or II weighted indexes of each peptide was calculated to get a total docking score (TDS), used as a score to compare the candidate peptides.

We applied our simulation model to three sets of premises, which we selected based on their numbers of neighbours, defined to be other premises within an 8km radius, with the additional constraint that none of the sets of premises were within each other's 8km radius. The selected sets of premises, which we designated as dense, medium and sparse, had 6, 3 and 0 neighbours, respectively. The SAVSNET data gave no indication that these selected premises are atypical or that they experienced a genuine outbreak during The top row of timeseries plots is the 'baseline' , that is the actual SAVSNET data without any simulated outbreak i.e. γ = 0. The subsequent rows from top to bottom depict increasing severities of simulated outbreak labelled according the probability of a case at premise i e.g. p = 0 and so on. The columns, from left to right, relate to the density of the region; 'sparse' , 'medium' and 'dense' respectively. For each simulation we plot the timeseries of the predicted distribution of S i,t for premise i. In each time timeseries the solid black line is the predicted value of S i,t , shaded areas are pointwise 50%, 90% and 95% predictive intervals. As an aid to rapid interpretation, we use a traffic-light system: if the predictive probability, q, is above 0.99 (defined as 'very high') the light shows red, if above 0.9 ('high') orange, if above 0.8 (medium) yellow, otherwise ('low') green (no outbreak).

We use each scenario to generate a simulated set of consultations for February 2016, to which we fit our model using Eq. (1). To assess the capability of our model to detect outbreaks we then use the predictive distribution S i,t from which we compute summary statistics, including exceedence probabilities and times to detection.

We do not recommend using l = 0 in practice, but use it here only as a benchmark to compare the system's performance under different scenarios. In a genuine application, the threshold value l would be chosen to represent a clinically significant increase in reporting rate, and the positive predictive value q 0 to balance sensitivity against specificity. Note, in this context, that because S i,t is measured on the probit scale, the increase in the fraction of GI cases corresponding to a fixed increase in S i,t necessarily depends on the baseline fraction.

The last decade has seen a growth in the field of disease surveillance in companion animals, notably in the UK 9,26 and in the USA 27, 29 . However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first surveillance system that conducts integrated spatio-temporal analysis of data from a national network of veterinary practices so as to enable real-time detection of spatially and temporally localised changes in reporting rate patterns across the network. We have illustrated the applicability of our proposed surveillance system using gastrointestinal disease syndrome in dogs and cats as an example. The system is fed with electronic health records (EHRs) collected in real-time through SAVSNET from volunteer veterinary premises across the UK. We applied our system to 15 simulated GI disease outbreaks of varying spatial extent and severity, amongst which the system was able to detect 14 of the 15. Had these been real outbreaks, the proposed surveillance system would have triggered timely investigations, which ultimately would have aided control strategies. The system requires the user to specify a reporting threshold corresponding to an increase in case incidence (reporting rate) that would be considered large enough to be of practical importance. Given this reporting threshold, the system delivers the predictive probability, q, at each location (here, veterinary premise), that the threshold is currently exceeded. Declaring an outbreak when this probability is greater than a specified value q 0 is equivalent to fixing the positive predictive value of the system (per location, per day) at q 0 . Alternatively, reporting the actual value of q gives an indication of the strength of evidence for an outbreak. Increasing the value of the reporting threshold, l, necessarily reduces the value of q and consequently increases the average time to detection of an outbreak at a fixed value of q 0.",20.46444705113852,11.425178883917923

Similarly, if the age of the animal was recorded outside the range 0 to 25 years then the record was excluded. SAVSNET records with missing data were removed before the analysis. If an animal attended a veterinary premise on more than one occasion during the study period we included all attendances outbreak Detection Modelling Rationale. As noted earlier, we define an outbreak as an unexplained spatially and temporally localised increase in the fraction of GI consultations amongst all consultations. The term ""unexplained"" refers to the fact that, for reasons that are well understood, some areas or times of year will experience higher fractions of GI consultations than others because of spatial variation in the local population susceptibility or temporal variation in the region-wide susceptibility to GI. We adjust for these known effects using measured explanatory variables, as described below in the section on explanatory variable selection. We then equate ""unexplained"" to ""stochastic"" and include this in our model as a latent, spatially and temporally correlated process S i,t , where i denotes premise and t denotes time, in days. By definition, the expected value of each S i,t is zero, and our goal is to determine where and when its actual value is materially greater than zero. Note that the natural pattern of GI consultations will always be subject to fluctuations in time and space that cannot be explained fully by measured variables. It follows that outbreak detection is not a statistical hypothesis-testing problem. Our approach acknowledges this by the fact that the actual value of S i,t will never be exactly zero. Our formal solution is therefore to calculate, for each premise i and day t, the predictive probability q (i.e. the probability conditional on all available data up to and including day t) that S i,t > l, where l is a user-specified threshold representing an effect large enough to be of practical concern. We then declare an outbreak affecting premise i if this probability exceeds q 0 , the required positive predictive value per premise, say q 0 = 0.95 or 0.99. As with any prediction problem using observational data, it is not possible simultaneously to control both the positive and negative predictive probabilities. prediction model. To accommodate the spatial and temporal correlations that would characterise an outbreak of GI disease, we use a spatio-temporal mixed effects regression model, and fit the model using Bayesian inference. We define our binary response variable Y j,it to take the value 1 if the j th consultation at the i th premise on day t is a GI disease presentation and 0 otherwise.

Based largely on their recapitulation of human disease signs, ferrets have also been used to derive serotyping reagents for assessing antigenic distance between isolates and potential vaccine strains. However, recent reports suggest that ferrets may not faithfully mimic human immune responses, and that serological tests using ferret sera may not accurately assess vaccine strain efficacy [1, 2] . Therefore, there is a need to develop additional permissive small animal models of influenza virus infection that exhibit virus shedding. Serial samples collected from such animal models allow the investigator to determine both the titer and duration of virus shedding from individual animals at multiple times without euthanasia. Further characterization of animal models capable of replicating and transmitting unadapted human, avian, and/or swine influenza viruses can be valuable for studying and testing new and improved vaccines, immunobiotics and anti-virals.

At the same time, a complex of physiological and biochemical methods combined with an appropriate analytical platform should be relatively simple (low-invasive and noninvasive methods), universal (modular), and flexible (algorithmic). Ambiguous expression pattern and complexity of determining many biomarkers decrease their predictive value, leading to an overdue diagnosis and bad prognosis. Parallel measurement of multiple ""early"" biomarkers would certainly increase the diagnostic accuracy. Together with identification studies, validation studies of multimarker assays are urgently needed.",27.823710008853595,12.743254951176914

The use of small animal models such as mice usually requires genetic modifications that dampen their immune system in order to increase viral permissiveness and, thus, do not reflect the reality of an infection in the natural host with an intact immune response. In most of the cases, in vivo DENV studies classically involve immunodeficient mouse strains such as AG129 which do not express IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptors. These mice are highly susceptible to DENV infection and generally die within two weeks after injection [166] [167] [168] . Following advancement of the knowledge about host-pathogen interactions and the advent of novel technologies (e.g., by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing), a paradigm shift can be anticipated. As an example of this, using a gene knock-in approach and a mouse-adapted virus strain, Gorman and colleagues recently developed an immunocompetent transgenic mouse model of ZIVK infection by replacing the mouse STAT2 by the human STAT2 [169] . This genetic engineering was conceptually made possible thanks to previous studies which showed that ZIKV induces the degradation of human STAT2 but not of the mouse ortholog [123, 124, 170] . While it will be interesting to see if the use of humanized immunocompetent mouse model can be expanded to DENV studies, it definitely opens up many future research opportunities.",23.20772497836913,11.941792356416164

Cohorts of animals are infected and euthanized, and viral load or immune responses are measured in predetermined tissues. This produces static snapshots of replication only at specific times and specific sites within the animal. Moreover, inherent animal-to-animal variability introduces significant confounding effects, resulting in studies that require hundreds of animals to acquire statistical significance. The power of these traditional approaches can be complemented, and many of these limitations overcome, by using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) (Fig 1) .

NDV replicates efficiently in the respiratory track of the host and induces strong local and systemic immune responses against the foreign antigen. As a vaccine vector, NDV can accommodate foreign sequences with a good degree of stability and as a RNA virus, there is limited possibility for recombination with host cell DNA. Using NDV as a vaccine vector in humans offers several advantages over other viral vaccine vectors. NDV is safe in humans due to host range restriction and there is no pre-existing antibody to NDV in the human population. NDV is antigenically distinct from common human pathogens. NDV replicates to high titer in a cell line acceptable for human vaccine development.

Ferrets are the closest known model for human transmission (see Box 4). Respiratory-droplet transmission studies in ferrets, and potentially in other animal models, have shown a remarkably strong correlation with human transmissibility of influenza A strains (Buhnerkempe et al., 2015) . While these assays are not perfectly predictive, they may be the most reliable way at present to assess the transmission potential of a virus in human populations. Here a partial counterexample to their overall strong predictive value is H7N9 avian influenza isolates from human zoonotic cases. These viruses transmit in ferrets, albeit less efficiently than human seasonal strains, yet humanto-human transmission has been extremely rare in the hundreds of human zoonotic cases caused by H7N9 (Buhnerkempe et al., 2015) . A challenge is the expense and practical challenge of using large enough numbers of ferrets (Buhnerkempe et al., 2015; Belser et al., 2013; Nishiura et al., 2013) to assess transmissibility; this will remain a technique of limited throughput for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, the value of ferret testing for risk assessment can be enhanced in at least two ways: first, by standardizing the conditions for ferret transmission experiments, so these can be more confidently compared between laboratories; and second, by continuing to combine ferret studies with studies of viral traits and sequence/structural studies to further identify correlates of transmissibility in ferrets.",32.617484128578,15.75688157144807

Having an animal model that can recapitulate human disease is essential for vaccine and therapeutic development as well as testing. For a potential animal model to be susceptible to infection, the virus must be able to 1.) gain entry into host cells; 2.) overcome the host's antiviral responses; and 3.) disseminate virus following infection to allow infection of other neighbouring cells and tissues. It is also of importance for the model to be able to recapitulate human disease and viral transmission modes. When evaluating the ability of an animal to be infected by a virus and serve as a model, viral shedding, clinical disease, and seroconversion should be determined. The past animal models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not universal due to the expression of the virus-specific cellular receptors for entry [63] . As SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not share a cellular receptor, they do not share the same host range and susceptibility, which includes research animal models [64] . Cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, and cats were some of the first animals to be determined susceptible to SARS-CoV [65, 66] . The advantage of ferrets is that they are a smaller animal compared to non-human primates and also are able to recapitulate some of the clinical symptoms and transmission kinetics of human respiratory viruses including coughing, sneezing, fever, and weight loss [67] . Although mice can be infected with SARS-CoV, as shown by recovery of vRNA and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, infection does not cause severe disease [68] . However, SARS-CoV could be passaged in mice (15 times) for the establishment of a model with clinical features [69] . After the identification of MERS-CoV, it was quickly determined that typical research animal models were not susceptible to the virus including mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets. Larger non-human primate models, such as Rhesus macaques and common marmoset were determined susceptible. To make use of small animal models, transgenic mice have been engineered for MERS-CoV susceptibility through expression of the human DPP4 receptor [70] . Other attempts at other mouse model developments were not successful, including an immunocompromised 129/SATA1-/-1 mouse [63] . Having an understanding of the animal models and model development previously utilized for the other coronaviruses of interest will aid in the development of a model for 2019-nCoV.

These animal models are indispensable for the deeper understanding of any diseases and safe and protective vaccine development process (Lorenzen et al., 2015) . The main criteria for the validation of animal models in preclinical studies are face validity, predictive validity and target validity. The face validity means that the proper similarity between the animal model and the human disease in terms of the biology and symptoms of the disease. However, assessing face validity is a tedious task due to the lack of understanding on the core biology of the disease symptoms. Predictive validity means the display of clinical interventions which exhibited similar effect in the animal models. This is also very difficult to achieve due to the incomplete correlation between animal models, the mechanism of human diseases and the incapability of standard drugs to active in many animal models. Target validity is another essential component for the validation of animal models in which the target under study must have an analogous function in the disease model as in the clinical condition (Denayer et al., 2014) . An ideal animal model is the one where an immunocompetent animal, on receiving the challenge virus at a realistic dose through a suitable inoculation route, is able to replicate the characteristics of a human disease as closely as possible (Doremalen and Munster, 2015) . Ferrets, hamsters, mice and other small laboratory animals are not ideal animal models for MERS-CoV owing to the variations in DPP4 receptor. The rhesus macaque and the common marmoset are the first non-human primate species (NPS) to be used as the animal models for MERS-CoV.

Global pandemic concerns stem from their high mortality rates, capacity for human-to-human spread by respiratory transmission, and complete lack of approved therapeutic countermeasures. Limiting disease may require the development of virus-directed and host-directed therapeutic strategies due to the acute etiology of hCoV infections. Therefore, understanding how hCoV-host interactions cause pathogenic outcomes relies upon mammalian models that closely recapitulate the pathogenesis of hCoVs in humans. Pragmatism has largely been the driving force underpinning mice as highly effective mammalian models for elucidating hCoV-host interactions that govern pathogenesis. Notably, tractable mouse genetics combined with hCoV reverse genetic systems has afforded the concomitant manipulation of virus and host genetics to evaluate virus-host interaction networks in disease. In addition to assessing etiologies of known hCoVs, mouse models have clinically predictive value as tools to appraise potential disease phenotypes associated with pre-emergent CoVs. Knowledge of CoV pathogenic potential before it crosses the species barrier into the human population provides a highly desirable preclinical platform for addressing global pathogen preparedness, an overarching directive of the World Health Organization. Although we recognize that results obtained in robust mouse models require evaluation in non-human primates, we focus this review on the current state of hCoV mouse models, their use as tractable complex genetic organisms for untangling complex hCoV-host interactions, and as pathogenesis models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions.",21.679937364184916,11.817518604331632

After the recent outbreaks, efforts to develop animal models with more clinically relevant isolates of the virus have been renewed. A rapid series of publications found that adult mice that lack type 1 (αβ; A129 and IFNAR −/− strains) or types 1 and 2 (αβ/γ; AG129 strain) interferon receptors are susceptible to lethal infection (Aliota et al. 2016; Lazear et al. 2016; Manangeeswaran et al. 2016; Rossi et al. 2016; Zmurko et al. 2016) . These models may have some relevance to human ZIKV infections in that, like many viruses, ZIKV gains advantages in human hosts by inhibiting interferon responses (Best 2017; Bowen et al. 2017; Schulz and Mossman 2016) . Because viruses may not be able to inhibit mouse-specific interferon pathways (Aguirre et al. 2012) , blocking them by other means, as in AG129 mice, may more closely mimic what happens in humans. Although AG129 mice are deficient in innate immune responses, they do elicit acquired immune responses, such as vaccine-elicited protective immunity (Sumathy et al. 2017; Weger-Lucarelli et al. 2017) . While complete knockout of the interferon responses produces a more severe disease in mice, it can provide insights into what happens when ZIKV gains access to the adult central nervous system (CNS). Besides a lethal infection, these mice manifest neurological symptoms such as Btoe walking,^tremors, loss of balance, paralysis, and hunched posture (Aliota et al. 2016; Lazear et al. 2016; Manangeeswaran et al. 2016; Rossi et al. 2016) .",19.84206923696813,9.450981236484607

However, in many biomedical studies which aim to translate findings to humans, non-mammals are not applicable as translational models (Hau, 2008 ). Yet, shorter phylogenetic distances and anatomical similarities are no guarantee for translational success, as research on primates has demonstrated (detailed in section The CD28 Superagonist Antibody ""Disaster""). Given the high relevance of protozoa for human and animal health and our own scientific interests in these parasites, we will concentrate on such infections in rodents. While their value as translational models is not without dispute (see section Protozoan Parasites) they have been, still are, and will continue to be, invaluable for both basic biological questions in host-parasite interactions as well as pre-clinical studies. Their importance for scientific progress is demonstrated, for example by the essential role laboratory mice played in the discovery of dendritic cells (see references in Steinman, 2012) and macrophages (reviewed by Gordon, 2007) . The value of rodents, and mice in particular, has also been highlighted for leading to fundamental insights in infection biology (Buer and Balling, 2003; Vidal et al., 2008; Douam et al., 2015) . Given the historical and current importance of rodents, we here explore benefits and limitations of, e.g., inbred or outbred mice, lab rodents, or rodents from the wild, etc., as well as possible external confounders, such as breeding conditions in lab facilities or interactions in an ecosystem, that might have great impact on research results. With this review, we encourage experimentalists, particularly in translational medicine, to consider a broad set of potential rodent models in order to identify and use the best available system for specific studies. We aim to provide a foundation and useful references for such decisions.",22.802940562627672,9.33978240424562

The demonstrated positive serological results in asymptomatic M. pneumoniae PCR-positive children (n = 66; IgM in 17%, IgG in 24%, and IgA in 6%) may simply reflect one or more previous encounters with M. pneumoniae and are not necessarily related to the presence of M. pneumoniae in the respiratory tract. Thus, it is questionable whether or not a positive result in these tests actually indicates the etiological role of M. pneumoniae in all cases. In that sense, the positive predictive value of these tests may be overestimated, whereas the negative predictive value may be acceptable (Bradley et al., 2011) . The ""gold standard"" for diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infections is still considered to be a fourfold increase in antibody titer as measured in paired sera (Gardiner et al., 2015) . However, the use of convalescent sera is not useful in clinical practice because it is too time-consuming and does not allow clinicians to initiate treatment protocols in a timely fashion.

The choice of an animal model is generally preferable to be as phylogenetically closer as possible to the human (Swearengen, 2018) .

Despite the success of some DNA vaccines in small animal models in veterinary applications, there are still limitations in plasmid delivery and lack of immunogenicity in large animal models. To improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines, adjuvants have been co-administered in vivo with DNA vaccines. It is also possible to incorporate an immunomodulatory adjuvant into the plasmid and co-express the adjuvant gene. Immunomodulatory genes, including cytokines (IL15, IL18) [9], Esat-1 [10], MDP-1 [11], HMGB1ΔC [12] or HSP70 [13, 14] , were found to enhance the humoral and cell-mediated immunity of AIV DNA vaccines.

At present, there are no licensed NiV vaccines for use in humans available. The existence of a NiV candidate vaccine should significantly reduce the risk of infection and transmission of the virus in the case of an outbreak scenario. There are some experimental NiV vaccines that have already been tested in different preclinical animal models. The major focus of these approaches was to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy in the context of NiV challenge infection. In those studies, efficacy has been mostly associated with the generation of NiV-specific antibodies, and immune monitoring is mainly relying on the detection of virus-neutralizing antibodies [31, 60, 61] . However, there is relatively little known about the induction and the relevance of NiV-specific cellular immune responses. In that context, the availability of appropriate tools to investigate the role of T cells in NiV-specific immunity is an important prerequisite in the development of new vaccines and therapeutics.

This increases the risk of NiV transmission to pigs and humans. The development of a NiV vaccine for use in pig populations would decrease the major risk NiV poses to the developing pig industries, as well as to the livelihoods of poor livestock keepers in Southeast Asia.

For face validity there must be similarities in the pathology and clinical symptoms between the animal model and the human disease (56). As discussed above, NiV infection of pigs causes a similar respiratory and neurological syndrome as seen in human infections. Although, disease severity in pigs may be considered lower than in humans. The predictive validity of a model means that clinically effective interventions demonstrate a similar effect in the animal model (56) . No clinical trials of NiV vaccine candidates have been reported to compare with vaccine performance in animal models, including the pig. As noted above, the success of the Equivac R HeV vaccine in horses and other animal models was not replicated in swine (38, 39) , highlighting a potential issue of predicative validity when comparing NiV vaccines between animal species, which may extend to humans. On the other hand, pigs have been used successfully as models to study many human infectious diseases (57) (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) (63) , including NiV infection (64) . There is also a growing appreciation that pigs provide a superior animal model for influenza A virus infection and immunity and should play a more prominent role as a model for human influenza vaccine development (65) . The success of the pig as an experimental animal model is partly due to their similarities with humans in terms of anatomy, immunology, and physiology, but also due to their manageable behavior and size, and by the general ethical acceptance of using pigs for experimental purposes instead of non-human primates (55, 63, 66) .",34.15526994728096,15.426115101894405

In particular, the restriction of infectious NiV work to BSL-4 containment has hampered progress. Conventional clinical trials with viruses such as NiV are not practical. To address the development of countermeasures for exotic pathogens such as NiV the FDA implemented the Animal Efficacy Rule in 2002. This rule specifically applies to the development of countermeasures when human efficacy studies are not possible or ethical. Briefly, this rule permits the evaluation of vaccines or therapeutics using data generated from studies performed in animal models that faithfully recapitulate human disease. There are currently at least eight animal models for NiV including the IFNAR-KO mouse model [35] ; the guinea pig model [36] ; the pig model [8, [37] [38] [39] ; the cat model [10, 11] ; the golden Syrian hamster model [7, [40] [41] [42] ; the ferret model [30, 43] ; and two nonhuman primate models, one in squirrel monkeys [44] and the other in African green monkeys [32] . While each of these models shares at least one or more aspects seen in human pathogenesis and can contribute to vaccine and therapeutic testing, the two animal models which completely emulate the pathogenesis seen in human cases to date are the ferret model and the African green monkey model.

Several human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) such as b12 [1] , X5 [2] , 2G12 [3] , 2F5 and 4E10 [4, 5] exhibit potent and broad HIV-1 neutralizing activity in vitro and can prevent HIV-1 infection in animal models [6] .

Therefore, Envs in various formats are potential candidate immunogens and have been evaluated in animal models and human clinical trials [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, neutralization efficacy of the resulting sera as broad as that by those bnAbs has not been achieved by empirically using these Envs as immunogens [11] . It has been suggested that characterization of the epitopes of the bnAbs could help design vaccine immunogens that would be able to elicit these bnAbs or similar antibodies in vivo [12] .

Our results show that these improvements in predictive precision were consistent between the three models and across all three of our study sites, and can be very substantive with up to as much as 92% to 96% reductions in prediction variance obtained by the best data-constrained models in a site compared to the use of model-only predictions ( Table 2 ). The practical policy implications of this finding can also be gleaned from appraising the actual numerical ranges in the predictions made by each individual model for each of the modelling scenarios investigated here. In the case of EPI-FIL, the best data-informed model (scenario 3 in Peneng) gave an elimination prediction range of 7-12 years, while the corresponding model-only predictions for this site indicated a need for between 6-29 years of annual MDA (Table 2 ). These gains in information from using data to inform model parameters and hence predictions were even larger for the two stochastic models investigated here, viz. LYMFASIM and TRANSFIL, where ranges as wide as 7-28 years predicted by model-only scenarios were reduced to 9-14 years for the best data-informed models in the case of LYMFASIM for Kirare village, and from as broad as 8-48 years to 7-22 years respectively in the case of TRANSFIL for Peneng (Table 2 ). These results unequivocally indicate that if parasite transmission models are used unconstrained by data, i.e. based on general parameter values uninformed by local data, it would lead to the making of predictions that would be marked by uncertainties that are likely to be far too large to be meaningful for practical policy making. If managers are risk averse, this outcome will also mean their need to plan interventions for substantially much longer than necessary, with major implications for the ultimate cost of the programme. Note also that although statistically significant changes in the median years of MDA required to achieve LF elimination were observed for the best datainformed models for all the three LF model types in each site, these were relatively small compared to the large reductions seen in each model's predictive uncertainly (Table 2, Fig 3) . This result highlights that the major gains from constraining the present models by data lies in improving their predictive certainty rather than in advancing their average behaviour. However, our preliminary analysis of model predictive accuracy suggests that the best data-constrained models may also be able to generate more accurate predictions of the impact of control ( Table 6 ), indicating that, apart from simply reducing predictive uncertainty, such models could additionally have improved capability for producing more reliable predictions of the outcomes of interventions carried out in a setting.",23.392502353934255,11.171201209447515

A secondary aim was to evaluate the relative value of data obtained at each of the sampling time points proposed by the WHO for monitoring the effects of LF interventions in informing these model predictions. This assessment allowed us to investigate the role of these data for learning system dynamics and measure their value for guiding the design of surveillance programmes in order to support better predictions of the outcomes of applied interventions. Fundamentally, however, this work addresses the question of how best to use predictive parasite transmission models for guiding management decision making, i.e. whether this should be based on the use of ideal models which incorporate generalized parameter values or on models with parameters informed by local data [10] . If we find that data-informed models can reduce prediction uncertainty significantly compared to the use of theoretical models unconstrained by data, then it is clear that to be useful for management decision making we require the application of model-data assimilation frameworks that can effectively incorporate information from appropriate data into models for producing reliable intervention projections. Antithetically, such a finding implies that using unconstrained ideal models in these circumstances will provide only approximate predictions characterized by a degree of uncertainty that might be too large to be useful for reliable decision making [14, 33, 62] .",21.652144636725396,8.575151557579888

The evaluation of an antiviral, in the context of a host with a functioning immune system, enables better understanding of therapeutics' potential efficacy. The evaluation of an antiviral in the context of an impaired immune system enables better understanding of therapeutic use in a particular immunosuppressed population. Pathogen host range, especially if not a simple issue of receptor utilization, can confound the ability to interpret, and extrapolate to the human, some of the nuances of the host pathogen interaction and prediction of potential human therapeutic benefit. Of the small animal models used to evaluate antiviral efficacy, all have used stringent virus challenges (all greater than 10 × LD 50 ) and shown survival benefit. Routes of infection have used methods that attempt to simulate potential human routes of infection and resultant human illness courses. Given the uncertainties of what a human infectious or lethal monkeypox dose is, it is difficult to extrapolate the potential -best fit‖ of any of these models for human disease. The clinical time course of disease in the prairie dog model, however, has a temporal relationship that is close to what has been described with human systemic orthopoxvirus (variola or monkeypox) disease. However, a limitation of the prairie dog and some of the other described animal systems, with the exception of the mouse model, is a paucity of immune reagents. There are a handful of antiviral compounds which show promise in these small animal models using monkeypox virus as the challenge. Additional studies evaluating treatment benefit when used in later stages of disease, their effect on elicitation of a protective immune response, evaluation of antiviral resistance, and their effect on viral shedding will improve our understanding of how they may be used in treatment of human disease, or in response to epidemic disease.",26.23653818315899,10.105167466011617

This study is in the early stages of the FMD oral vaccines and needs more tests to enhance the immune effect. Further studies will be carried on larger animals which are susceptible to FMDV, such as swine and bovine, and the studies are required to consider immune effect comparison of the intranasal immunization and the oral immunization, the coexpression of larger fragments and cytokines. Many experts anticipate that, in the next decade, more applications of rLAB as therapeutic tools will be developed and optimized because LAB delivery is now a true realistic option in both human and animal medicine [13, 53, 54] .

However, employing DNA as a basis for vaccination also implicates some disadvantages. A concern in this context is the long-term persistence of DNA plasmids upon injection. Indeed, DNA persistence was shown in various preclinical studies that demonstrated the presence of plasmid DNA for up to 2 years upon IM injection with low but detectable expression and immunogenicity in a mouse model (88) . According to the FDA, DNA persistence is not generally evident at ectopic sites in biodistribution and persistence studies, but remains detectable at the injection sites for periods exceeding 60 days 8 . Especially in the context of this long-term persistence, the presence of foreign genetic information in the nucleus of transfected cells poses the additional risk of genomic integration into the host's chromosomes and the resulting threat of mutagenesis and oncogenesis. Despite negative results in several studies focusing on detection of DNA integration events upon IM injection in small animal models, genomic integration events were detectable following electroporation in mice (89, 90) demonstrating that integration represents a small risk that nevertheless needs to be considered in systems with enhanced DNA uptake. The FDA recommends integration studies to be included whenever plasmid DNA exceeding 30,000 copies per µg of host DNA persists in any tissue by study termination. The WHO advises integration studies as part of the preclinical safety program of DNA vaccines 9 . In addition, injection of bacterial DNA, sensed by the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs, has been associated with safety concerns, such as the generation of antibodies against the injected DNA. However, no anti-DNA antibodies have been detectable in mice, rats, rabbits or non-human primates (90) . Potential expression of the antibiotic resistance marker in vaccinated organisms has likewise raised safety concerns that are met by the replacement of these markers in next generation DNA vaccines. Lastly, expression of cytokines or co-stimulatory molecules that are used to enhance DNA immunogenicity might lead to unintended adverse effects upon cytokine expression and release such as generalized immune suppression, chronic inflammation or autoimmunity.

It can run at least three clinical courses: the relapsingremitting (RR), which is the most frequent (85%) and it is characterized by exacerbations and subsequent periods of clinical stability; secondary progressive (SP) and the primary-progressive (PP) subtype (Noseworthy et al., 2000) . CNS tissue from Multiple Sclerosis patients shows discrete lesions with inflammatory infiltrates, demyelination, astrogliosis and early axonal damage. MS is widely considered an autoimmune demyelinating disease, where an autoimmune reaction by myelin-specific CD4 þ T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, which initiate the neuropathology, has been described (Hafler et al., 2005; Sospedra and Martin, 2005) . A specific cause for the pathogenesis of MS has not been identified so far, although several genetic and environmental risk factors have been suggested to play a central role. In this context, animal models of MS had allowed to explore mechanisms of disease initiation and progression and test several novel therapeutical approaches for the disease. the question whether these animal models could really represent a good model for MS since they do not perfectly reflect all the aspects of the human disease. In particular, disease initiation is usually highly artificial in the animal models (induced by active immunization with an auto-antigen). Also the time-frame of the clinical symptoms onset is different between humans and mice. In humans, physiological processes underlying the disease are undetected for years before the onset of clinical manifestations, while symptoms in the animal models can be detected within weeks or even days after induction of the disease. Moreover the treatment in these therapy studies started very early in the course of the induced autoimmune disease, whereas any therapy for humans is administered in a late phase of the disease. More importantly, most of the experimental studies use inbred strains mice with genetic homogeneity and often these mice may have accumulated genetic irregularities that are very difficult to find in human population. Although it has become clear that rodent and human immune systems have profound differences (as they are evolutionarily distant), they share some essential principles and, in this context, the availability of three major animal models of MS allowed the understanding of relevant features of the human MS. The most commonly studied animal models of MS are (1) the experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE); (2) viral induced models, mainly Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection and consequential chronic demyelination and (3) toxin-induced models of demyelination, such as the cuprizone and the lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lysolecithin) models.",20.69480916740288,10.246256900912785

The first is the potential for immunogenicity to the molecule that could curtail its efficacy and/or safety in repeated treatments. The present animal studies were not suited to address the potential immunogenicity of AvFc, because the Fc domain of AvFc is of human origin, which itself would be immunogenic in mice and monkeys. Given that experimental animal models have a limited predictive value for the assessment of therapeutic protein immunogenicity in humans, 41,42 the use of AvFc variants with a species-specific Fc domain is, at least, essential to address the immunogenicity question in preclinical studies. Should this, indeed, be an issue, several potential remedies may be tested to minimize immunogenicity, including T cell epitope deletion, pegylation, and others, though these studies were beyond the scope of the present report. Second, AvFc showed a relatively short serum halflife of 27.7 h in rhesus macaques ( Figure 6C ). This may be, in part, due to slightly decreased affinity to FcRn compared to a human IgG1 isotype control, as shown in Table 1 . A potential solution may be the modification of the Fc region to improve FcRn affinity, such as those described by Zalevsky et al. 43 Additionally, studies are underway to determine the biodistribution profile and off-target binding potential of AvFc. While normal cells do not typically display high amounts of HMGs at their surface, these immature glycans have been found to be enriched in the plasma membranes of cancer cells [44] [45] [46] and embryonic stem cells. 47, 48 A future study should carefully evaluate what cell types other than HIV-or SIV-infected cells are recognized by AvFc.",24.9714366959087,10.80726211650105

Of these, the nasal route is the most straightforward and is suitable for vaccine administration. Advantages and disadvantages of nasal vaccination are summarized in Table 1 . The prime inductive site for mucosal immunity in the nasopharyngeal tract in rodents is the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) [7] [8] [9] . NALT is considered the rodent equivalent of Waldeyer's ring (Fig. 1) , the lymphoid tissues (tonsils) present in humans [10] . Waldeyer's ring forms a protective site at the opening of the pharynx to provide immunity [11] . Protection at this mucosal surface is correlated with secretory immunoglobulin-A (sIgA) antibodies which, alongside other innate defence mechanisms, provide additional protection from pathogens [12] . Murine NALT is a functional analogue to human tonsils, and animal research has provided insight into human immunology. Such studies are essential before any human trials of vaccine candidates. However, human immunity and biological composition can differ from those of animal models.

The first is the potential for immunogenicity to the molecule that could curtail its efficacy and/or safety in repeated treatments. The present animal studies were not suited to address the potential immunogenicity of AvFc, because the Fc domain of AvFc is of human origin, which itself would be immunogenic in mice and monkeys. Given that experimental animal models have a limited predictive value for the assessment of therapeutic protein immunogenicity in humans, 41,42 the use of AvFc variants with a species-specific Fc domain is, at least, essential to address the immunogenicity question in preclinical studies. Should this, indeed, be an issue, several potential remedies may be tested to minimize immunogenicity, including T cell epitope deletion, pegylation, and others, though these studies were beyond the scope of the present report. Second, AvFc showed a relatively short serum halflife of 27.7 h in rhesus macaques ( Figure 6C ). This may be, in part, due to slightly decreased affinity to FcRn compared to a human IgG1 isotype control, as shown in Table 1 . A potential solution may be the modification of the Fc region to improve FcRn affinity, such as those described by Zalevsky et al. 43 Additionally, studies are underway to determine the biodistribution profile and off-target binding potential of AvFc. While normal cells do not typically display high amounts of HMGs at their surface, these immature glycans have been found to be enriched in the plasma membranes of cancer cells [44] [45] [46] and embryonic stem cells. 47, 48 A future study should carefully evaluate what cell types other than HIV-or SIV-infected cells are recognized by AvFc.",24.830225965319308,10.757838360794763

Usually, the highest tolerable dose is proposed in clinical trials in order to achieve clinical efficacy and accelerate the approval; however, adverse effects can occur even for the approved inhaled antibiotics due to the inhalation of high-dose antibiotics. Hence, dosing strategies should be optimized using antimicrobial PK/PD for superior clinical outcomes and minimal adverse effects [112] . With no doubt, PK/PD studies of inhaled antibiotics are very challenging in human subjects, because plasma PK may not be correlated with the clinical efficacy of inhaled treatment for respiratory infections. Bronchoalveolar lavage is highly invasive in patients and sputum antibiotic concentration is usually a poor surrogate of drug exposure in the lung. Preclinical PK/PD evaluation in animals is more practical [113] and has been widely employed for oral and parenteral administration of antibiotics [114] . However, there is very limited PK/PD information on inhaled antibiotics using animal models. The choice of animal models for PK/PD studies after antibiotic inhalation is usually based upon practical considerations; rodents, rabbits and guinea pigs are most commonly used [115] [116] [117] . For larger animal species, factors including welfare and large inhalation chambers should be considered [118] .

This may make it difficult to fully assess their safety in the absence of humanized animal models. In this situation, it would be useful to identify in vitro surrogates of adjuvant toxicity, using human cell lines or primary cells, with readouts such as potency of cytokine induction [146] . Unfortunately, such in vitro approaches may have limited value, as they cannot recapitulate the complexity of adjuvant action in vivo. For example, many adjuvants, including aluminium, have little effect on cytokine production in vitro and yet have potent adjuvant effects in vivo. Furthermore, toxicity may occur in distant and unexpected tissue compartments, such as the hepatotoxicity seen with injection of NKT cell agonists [135] . Hence, assessment of adjuvant potency, tolerability and safety will continue to require in vivo testing. Given that vaccine adverse effects may affect only rare individuals in a stochastic manner or because of underlying genetic susceptibilities, predictive animal models need to be able to recapitulate such factors. This necessitates research into the nature of human susceptibilities to adjuvant toxicity, with tools including whole-genome sequencing, gene expression arrays and deep sequencing approaches now readily available to start addressing such questions.",26.3713292757479,12.394237173391646

These types of compounds are likely to have very different toxicities. All TLR agonists activate the inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-jB through the TLR adaptor proteins MYD88 and TRIF [90] . A consequence of NF-jB activation in monocytes is production of pyrogens and inflammatory cytokines, thereby resulting in potential for dose-limiting inflammation and pyrexia [91] . Attempts to detoxify TLR agonists inevitably lead to some loss of adjuvant activity. This is exemplified by conversion of the highly toxic TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide to the less toxic MPL [92] . Given its modest potency, MPL needs to be combined with aluminium or other adjuvants for best effect [92] . AS04 is an example of a combination adjuvant of MPL and aluminium, and it is included in an approved prophylactic hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine for low-responder renal dialysis patients [93] and a prophylactic human papilloma virus vaccine [94] . HBV-AS04 vaccine was more locally reactogenic than a standard aluminiumadjuvanted vaccine, with pain at the injection site occurring with 41 % of HBV-AS04 doses, versus 19 % of standard vaccine doses, consistent with increased vaccine reactogenicity due to the MPL component [93] . In animal models, TLR4 adjuvants have been shown to cause aberrant immune responses associated with toxicity [95] . For example, inclusion of a TLR4 agonist with an intranasal influenza vaccine in mice caused exacerbated illness and death when immunized animals were challenged with influenza, with the exacerbated lung pathology subsequently found to be due to the TLR4 agonist inducing an excessive IL-17 response [95] . TLR4 agonists have also been shown to be able to break tolerance and induce autoimmunity in susceptible animal models [96] . For example, TLR4 agonists-just like the inflammatory agents trehalose dimycolate, b-glucan, pristane and squalene oil-are potent inducers of inflammatory arthritis in susceptible strains [96] . However, the potential significance of these findings for human safety is not known, and relative doses used in human adjuvants are likely to be much lower than those used in animal models.",23.85875051295391,11.623507845168024

Whilst it is sure that the vast majority of the animal models used in the laboratory are mice and rats because of well rehearsed arguments: they are small, easy to work with, inexpensive to keep, their generation time is short and they have large litters that can allow controlled breeding programmes, however, in part because of their short lifespan, murine models may fail to reproduce authentically the human diseases process. Therefore, longitudinal studies still need to be performed in large animal models. Dog, cat, sheep and, in general, large animal models have a longer lifespan, their physiological parameters, e.g. their immune system, and their size make them more similar to humans than the murine models. This does not address the question of ethics, and certainly not of cost. The use of larger animal models allows the disease states to be modelled more accurately than rodent models, some of these diseases are even naturally occurring e.g. gene therapy has been evaluated in the brains of cats affected with α-mannosidosis (AMD) and the RPE65 −/− dog suffers from early and severe visual impairment, similar to that seen in human Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). The pig can be used both for the prevention of (porcine) foot-and-mouth disease and in studying human heart disease. Horses naturally develop arthritis. Even choosing to move to fish as an initial model is, quite rightly, covered by the same ethical issues as murine models. So we are not advocating zebrafish as an insignificant model, rather we are highlighting that some fish models may enable useful biological data to be collected in certain research areas, with regard to skin pigmentation, deafness, and for cancer studies, and especially we stress that fish are relevant for the ease of production of 200-600 embryos and then looking in vivo with single cell resolution. The cellular and genetic basis of disease (phenotypes at high resolution) can be routinely studied in zebrafish and medaka. We are keenly aware of the importance of refinement (in the experiment), reduction (in the total number of animals used), and replacement (of animals with cells lines or computer modelling) (the 3Rs).

In a retrospective study of brain MRI scans obtained at first attack from children subsequently diagnosed with MS and ADEM (Callen et al., 2009) , the presence of any two of the following MRI features indicated an increased risk of developing MS: (1) absence of a diffuse bilateral lesion pattern; (2) presence of black holes; and (3) presence of two or more periventricular lesions.

As mentioned earlier, there are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines. In addition, many technologies used (production platforms, vectors, etc.) are new and need to be tested thoroughly for safety. The target for the vaccine, the S protein, has been identified, and vaccine candidates are being generated. This is usually followed by two important steps that are typically needed before bringing a vaccine into clinical trials. First, the vaccine is tested in appropriate animal models to see whether it is protective. However, animal models for SARS-CoV-2 might be difficult to develop. The virus does not grow in wild-type mice and only induced mild disease in transgenic animals expressing human ACE2 (Bao et al., 2020) . Other potential animal models include ferrets and NHPs, for which pathogenicity studies are ongoing. Even in the absence of an animal model that replicates human disease, it is possible to evaluate the vaccine because serum from vaccinated animals can be tested in in vitro neutralization assays. Post-challenge safety data should also be collected in these cases to assess for complications such as the ones seen SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV vaccines. Second, vaccines need to be tested for toxicity in animals, e.g., in rabbits. Usually, viral challenge is not part of this process, because only the safety of the vaccine will be evaluated. This testing, which has to be performed in a manner compliant with GLP (Good Laboratory Practice), typically takes 3-6 months to complete. For some vaccine platforms, parts of the safety testing might be skipped if there is already sufficient data available for similar vaccines made in the same production process. Vaccines for human use are produced in processes that comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) to ensure constant quality and safety of vaccines. This requires dedicated facilities, trained personnel, proper documentation, and raw material that was produced to be of cGMP quality. These processes have to be designed or amended to fit SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

""Humanized mice,"" transgenic severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID) mice grafted with human cells and tissues, enable research in regenerative medicine, infectious disease, cancer, and human hematopoiesis. In addition, high-throughput DNA sequencing efforts, positional cloning programs, and novel embryonic stem cell-based gene discovery research areas all exploit the knockout mouse as their laboratory. Engineered animal models are proving invaluable to pharmaceutical research since small animal models of disease may be created and validated to mimic a disease in human patients. Mouse, rat, and zebra fi sh are the most common models explored and used. Genetic engineering can predispose an animal to a particular disease under scrutiny, and the insertion of human genes into the animal can initiate the development of a more clinically relevant disease condition. In human clinical studies, assessments of effi cacy and safety often rely on measured effects for surrogate biomarkers and adverse event reporting. Validated transgenic animal models of human disease allow for parallel study and possible predictability prior to entering clinical trials. Also, it is possible to screen potential drug candidates in vivo against a human receptor target inserted into an animal model. The number of examples of transgenic animal models of human disease useful in drug discovery and development efforts is growing rapidly (Sharpless and DePinho 2006 ; Schultz et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2011b ; Clark and Pazdernik 2012b ) .

However, in contrast to the findings with inactivated RSV vaccine discussed above, there was no evidence of enhanced disease in infants who received the PIV vaccine. Purified HN and F or virus vectors expressing HN or F have provided materials for either parenteral or topical immunization, and have been tested in animal models of parainfluenza virus infection (Blaine et al., 1980; Ray et al., 1985; Spriggs et al., 1987; Ray et al., 1988; Sullivan et al., 1993) .

The challenge in any less invasive method is that the nasal mucosa is heavily colonized with normal bacterial fl ora. Cultures of the middle meatus obtained by the use of an endoscope have been used as a surrogate for sinus aspiration. The maxillary, frontal, and anterior air cells of the ethmoid sinuses drain into the middle meatus via the osteomeatal complex. The endoscope is inserted into the nose, and a sample is obtained from material in the middle meatus via a swab or aspiration. The mucosa of the anterior nares must be disinfected, and meticulous care must be taken to be sure the endoscope does not touch the nasal vestibule and become contaminated. Benninger et al. performed a meta-analysis of studies in a mainly adult population comparing endoscopically obtained cultures of the middle meatus to maxillary sinus puncture [ 5 ] . When all bacterial isolates are considered, endoscopically obtained cultures show a sensitivity of 80 %, specifi city of 70 %, positive predictive value of 78 %, negative predictive value of 75 %, and an overall accuracy of 76 % when compared with maxillary sinus aspiration. If only the sinus pathogens S. pneumoniae , H. infl uenzae , and M. catarrhalis are taken into account, the test performs somewhat better with a sensitivity and specifi city of 81 and 83 %, positive and negative predictive value of 91 and 89 %, and overall accuracy of 87 %. Given that the caliber of the nasal passage in children is signifi cantly smaller than adults, one might expect a greater rate of contamination of endoscopically obtained cultures when this procedure is performed in children. Hsin et al. compared endoscopic middle meatal cultures to maxillary sinus puncture in children 2-12 years with subacute and chronic sinusitis [ 6 ] . This population of children had failed 30 days or more of antimicrobial therapy. Endoscopic culture performed less well in children than adults with a sensitivity of 75 %, a specifi city of 99.9 %, a positive predictive value of 96 %, negative predictive value of 50 %, and an accuracy of 78 %. Overall endoscopic cultures may provide useful information for the treatment of individual adults when interpretation is confi ned to the three sinus pathogens: S. pneumoniae , H. infl uenzae , and M. catarrhalis .

In these situations, the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the chest X-ray. Problems arise from differentiating pneumonia from pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, atelectasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]. Computerized tomography [CT] scan may or may not be able to differentiate these conditions. Bedside ultrasonography has been used for diagnosing pneumonia but is less reliable than radiography, with sensitivity ranging from 57% to 100% and specificity of 54% to 99% [37] . Ultrasound is more useful for defining the presence and severity of associated pleural effusion. Investigators have also assessed the value of molecular biomarkers in severely ill patients to differentiate CAP from noninfectious cause of lung infiltrates. In a study of 234 patients admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU] with suspected CAP genome-wide transcription profiling of blood leucocytes was investigated. Expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways was similar between patients with and without CAP, and blood concentrations of biomarkers such as procalcitonin, interleukin [IL]-6, and interleukin IL-8 were not discriminatory [38] . Further analysis revealed that the ratio of two genes, FAIM3 and PLAC8, was best for distinguishing CAP from no-CAP. The FAIM3:PLAC8 ratio provided a positive predictive value of 83.1% and negative predictive value of 81.3%.

Six topics were addressed in detail by speakers and workshop participants and are reported in a series of six reports. This workshop report, the second in the series, provides recommendations for current and future use of nonanimal methods and strategies for veterinary vaccine potency testing. Workshop participants recommended that future efforts to replace animal use give priority to vaccines (1) that use large numbers of animals per test and for which many serials are produced annually, (2) that involve significant animal pain and distress during procedures, (3) for which the functional protective antigen has been identified, (4) that involve foreign animal/zoonotic organisms that are dangerous to humans, and (5) that involve pathogens that can be easily spread to wildlife populations. Vaccines identified as the highest priorities were those for rabies, Leptospira spp., Clostridium spp., Erysipelas, foreign animal diseases (FAD), poultry diseases, and fish diseases. Further research on the identification, purification, and characterization of vaccine protective antigens in veterinary vaccines was also identified as a priority. critical knowledge and data gaps, including opportunities to apply new science and technology. Recommendations included (1) investigations into the relative impact of various adjuvants on antigen quantification assays, (2) investigations into extraction methods that could be used for vaccines containing adjuvants that can interfere with antigen assays, and (3) review of the current status of rabies and tetanus human vaccine in vitro potency methods for their potential application to the corresponding veterinary vaccines.

However, such development efforts are generally segregated in the animal and human health divisions in industry and academia, and have separate regulatory pathways. This results in a potential waste of resources and duplicated scientific endeavors. Interestingly, when one company (Akso Nobel), an animal health company, decided in 2003 on a strategic move into human vaccine development, it drew on its veterinary scientists to staff the program. As pointed out in this review, there have been isolated successful examples, e.g. a West Nile vaccine, of co-development of a vaccine for both veterinary and human indications, an obviously efficient strategy that broadened both the commercial and public health opportunity. Future efforts along similar lines should be considered on a case by case basis, depending on medical need, but in general there is value in closer connections between human and veterinary vaccines and regulatory science, and in the application of domesticated animals as models for development of infectious disease and cancer vaccines.

This fact illustrates the current status of stove-piped and separate animal and human health biopharmaceutical industries. The exceptional case is of interest as a model of how vaccine development for zoonotic diseases could be improved. In 1999, within 2 months of the identification of West Nile as the etiological agent of the initial outbreak affecting humans and horses in New York, Acambis, a publically traded human-vaccine biotechnology company, applied its platform technology for yellow fever 17Dvectored vaccines to the development of a West Nile vaccine, with the intent to develop both vaccines for both horses and humans. This technology involved replacing the gene encoding the yellow fever 17D vaccine virus' envelope (E) protein with the corresponding gene of West Nile virus. This chimeric vector vaccine platform had been previously used by the company to construct a chimeric vaccine against the closely-related Japanese encephalitis virus [19] ; at the time, that vaccine had proven to be highly effective, protecting non-human primates against intracerebral challenge with virulent Japanese encephalitis virus [20] . Two new vectors were engineered, one with the wild-type West Nile NY99 strain E protein gene and one with an E gene containing three attenuating mutations [21] [22] [23] . The former was neurovirulent in mice, while the latter was more attenuated and thus deemed more suitable as a human vaccine. The principal question was whether the yellow fever 17D vector would infect and immunize horses, since yellow fever is a host-restricted primate virus. To find out, studies were sponsored by Acambis in early 2000 at the Colorado State University School of Veterinary Medicine. Horses were vaccinated with the West Nile/yellow fever chimeric virus or with yellow fever 17D vaccine, and viremia and antibody responses were determined [24] . In addition, vaccinated and control horses were challenged by the intrathecal injection of a high dose of virulent West Nile virus, following the same model referred to above for protection studies of the chimeric Japanese encephalitis vaccine wherein monkeys were challenged by the intracerebral route. These studies showed that horses inoculated with chimeric vaccine developed neutralizing antibodies against West Nile and were protected against a severe intrathecal challenge. A similar development plan was successfully followed for the mutated human vaccine version, using non-human primates as the test host. The veterinary and human vaccine candidates were developed side by side, and the data obtained in both programs were designed to support transition to advanced clinical trials in horses and humans. In 2002, Acambis licensed the veterinary vaccine technology to a major animal health company (Intervet), and in the same year clinical trial materials were made for human trials. Intervet completed development of the veterinary vaccine (PreveNile ® ) [25] , which was approved by USDA in 2007, and Acambis brought the human vaccine (ChimeriVax-WN02) into clinical trials in the same timeframe [26] , subsequently outlicensing the technology to Sanofi Pasteur. As expected, development of the veterinary vaccine and its progression through the regulatory pathway substantially outpaced the human vaccine; importantly, the veterinary application significantly informed the human vaccine Table 2 Strengths and limitations of vaccination of animals as a means to control of zoonotic diseases.",26.015491713977845,12.707377168003664

US Army investigators explored the use of TC-83 live, attenuated human vaccine for immunization of equids beginning in 1962 [120] , and there was limited field use of the vaccine in Colombia in 1967. However, when epizootic VEE appeared for the first time in Central America (Guatemala) in May 1969, and then spread southwards to Costa Rica and northwards to the US, there was considerable urgency to utilize a vaccine strategy for control of the disease in horses, donkeys and mules. In 1969, the US military responded rapidly to requests for TC-83 vaccine from Guatemala and El Salvador. The vaccine had been produced and stockpiled at the Merrell National Laboratories, Swiftwater PA under contract to the USAMRDC for the purposes of biological defense. By 1972, over 10 million doses of TC-83 had been given to equidae in the US, Mexico and Central America [106] . Collaborative studies were also undertaken by agencies concerned with human and animal health (USAMRDC, NIH and USDA) to fully explore the biology of the vaccine in horses [121, 122] , ultimately leading to licensure and commercialized by the animal health industry, both as a live vaccine and then an inactivated vaccine combo with eastern and western equine encephalitis vaccines. TC-83 vaccine was credited with a rapid curtailment of the 1969-71 outbreak. The history of VEE exemplifies many One Health principles, including the prevention of human cases through domesticated animal vaccination, use of a single vaccine product for animals and humans, and an agency (the US Army) concerned with human health engaged in both veterinary and human vaccine development, and providing a solution for curtailing an emerging zoonosis. After the large epizootic in the 1970s, TC-83 vaccine was again deployed during the epidemic in 1995 in Colombia to create an immune barrier to spread of the virus.",26.782923995643834,12.456854244785003

In the US, a live, attenuated virus (TC-83) was developed by the US Army Medical Research & Development Command (USAMRDC) by empirical passages of the prototype Trinidad donkey (subtype IAB) virus in fetal guinea pig heart cell culture [117] . The development of the live vaccine followed poor experiences with chemically inactivated vaccines; in animal models, only the live vaccine protected against aerosol challenge. However, TC-83 vaccine has a number of drawbacks as a human vaccine, including failure to immunize about 18% of vaccinees, and moderate-to-severe reactogenicity in about 25% of subjects. In humans, it remains an investigational product, used solely for the protection of laboratory workers [118] , with approximately 7000 persons vaccinated since 1963. The TC-83 virus acquired 12 mutations during the empirical passage series in guinea pig heart cells, but attenuation appears linked to only 2 of these, in the 5 -noncoding region and the E2 envelope glycoprotein, and these substitutions appear to be subject to reversion in the vaccinated host [119] . In addition, TC-83 has been isolated from mosquito vectors during field use, illustrating the potential for secondary spread and mutation and recombination events. An investigational formalin-inactivated TC-83 vaccine (designated C-84) was also developed by USAMRDC and used following TC-83 priming to seroconvert TC-83 non-responders.",22.5518330238124,12.271634116336813

However, the total protein content and cell counts of abdominal and pleural effusions vary considerably, which complicates the diagnosis for some cats with effusive disease. Very rarely, chylous effusions occur. 48 An effusion albumin/globulin ratio below 0.4 is suggestive of FIP. 49 The Rivalta test is a simple test that can differentiate between transudates and exudates.

An ideal animal model would display a pathological response to infection with HIV-1,0.1906323658381695,2.0192716121673584,1.9613025188446045,70b2758e-14ad-4f83-abf9-da35b4b34d4e,custom_license/Current progress in the development of a prophylactic vaccine for Hiv-1,"One particular challenge with the use of animal models for development of a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine is that there are very few naturally occurring disease models of HIV-1. Only a few nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection with HIV-1 and infected animals do not progress to AIDS. 56 Therefore, it is important to use other disease models that mimic the HIV-AIDS pathologic progression. 57 One such potential model is feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). FIV was discovered in 1986 and is known to cause an AIDS-like disease in domestic cats and mimics HIV-related dementia in humans. 58 A vaccine for FIV was approved by the FDA in 2002. 59 While the FIV model is potentially informative, its use is not sufficient as a basis for development of a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. An ideal animal model would display a pathological response to infection with HIV-1 that is very similar to the one that occurs in humans. Unfortunately, HIV-1 does not cause pathology leading to the development of AIDS in any host other than humans. [60] [61] [62] [63] However, animal models have been developed and used that allow partial understanding of the pathology of HIV-1, the natural immunological response to infection, and the response of the host to novel therapeutics. One of these models involves the simian immunodeficiency virus MAC (SIV MAC ) that replicates and causes an AIDS-like disease in baboons, cynomolgus, and pigtailed macaques. While the similarities of SIV MAC to HIV-1 have allowed for insight into pathology, transmission, and immunological response of the infected host to the virus, the differences between SIV MAC and HIV-1 are still too great to be able to draw conclusions regarding potential human responses to an HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine. 63 Therefore, to broaden the scope of animal model usage, a chimeric SHIV virus was engineered to incorporate both SIV and HIV-1 proteins or genes. 64 While macaques infected with SHIV do go on to develop AIDS, the time to progression is much different from the time to progression to AIDS of HIV-1-infected humans. Infection of macaques with SIV mac 251 strain mimics HIV-1 infection in humans by leading to chronic, slow disease progression. Route and dose required for infection, viral tropism, replicative capacity of the viruses, and pathology of SIV/SHIV-infected monkeys are all very different than these parameters in humans. 65, 66 This distinction has been well characterized by the recent Phase IIb STEP trial, which involved 3000 healthy, uninfected volunteers. The result of this trial was termination at its first scheduled efficacy assessment due to its failure to suppress viral load in subsequently infected individuals and then-suspected increased HIV-1 infection due to interaction of the immune system with vaccine components. 67 The vaccine, a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) virus incorporating the gag, pol, and nef genes from HIV-1, had been previously tested in an SHIV model in macaques and the results of that experiment were not suggestive of the results of the human trial. 68 This disparity underscores the need for animal models that more closely reflect the pathology seen in human infection with HIV-1 as well as identification of immunological correlates of protection that reflect control of HIV-1 viral load in human subjects. Therefore, the search for an appropriate animal model or the appropriate use of current animal models in the search for a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine continues. Until a model can be derived that will allow for observation of each stage of infection, progression of disease, and response of the immune system in a way that is comparable to this process in humans, we will not be able to logically predict which vaccine candidates should be moved forward to clinical trials.",26.52365154772654,11.870651226862066

Usually, the highest tolerable dose is proposed in clinical trials in order to achieve clinical efficacy and accelerate the approval; however, adverse effects can occur even for the approved inhaled antibiotics due to the inhalation of high-dose antibiotics. Hence, dosing strategies should be optimized using antimicrobial PK/PD for superior clinical outcomes and minimal adverse effects [112] . With no doubt, PK/PD studies of inhaled antibiotics are very challenging in human subjects, because plasma PK may not be correlated with the clinical efficacy of inhaled treatment for respiratory infections. Bronchoalveolar lavage is highly invasive in patients and sputum antibiotic concentration is usually a poor surrogate of drug exposure in the lung. Preclinical PK/PD evaluation in animals is more practical [113] and has been widely employed for oral and parenteral administration of antibiotics [114] . However, there is very limited PK/PD information on inhaled antibiotics using animal models. The choice of animal models for PK/PD studies after antibiotic inhalation is usually based upon practical considerations; rodents, rabbits and guinea pigs are most commonly used [115] [116] [117] .

Moreover, the characteristics and conditions that make an antibody protective against EBOV in animal models and/or in humans are not fully understood. Furthermore, the protective ability of a specific mAb in one animal model does not necessarily imply that it provides protection in another animal model. Nacayama and Saijo (2013) have comprehensively reviewed the different animal models used to study EBOV infection, mainly rodents and non-human primates (NHP), and have summarized their strengths and weaknesses. NHP, particularly rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, better mimic EBOV infection in humans and more closely reproduce the symptoms of the disease than do rodents. However, the use of NHP presents researchers with more significant practical and ethical hurdles (Nacayama and Saijo, 2013; Geisbert et al., 2015) than does the use of rodents. Different rodent models have been developed to do EBOV research, including some knockout variants (Brannan et al., 2015) . The practicality of using rodents in the laboratory and the possibility of using genetically modified animals has made them an attractive model with which to study the protective effect of anti-EBOV therapies and vaccines. However, the EBOV has to be adapted to cause lethal infection in rodents, which represents a highly restrictive situation given the high risk presented by handling a BSL-4 pathogen, such as EBOV. Moreover, some widely used rodents, such as mice and guinea pigs, do not exhibit some of the distinctive symptoms of EBOV in primates, such as fever and rash, which further suggests dissimilarities between the anti-EBOV immune response in rodents and primates. In general, anti-EBOV protection in rodents is not a conclusive indicator of protection in humans. Probably the best example of this is the case of mAb KZ52, which is neutralizing and protective in rodents but not in NHPs. In the particular case of anti-EBOV mAb therapies, NHP studies appear to be a mandatory step in predicting efficacy in humans. However, no clear correlation can be established between therapeutic effectiveness in NHPs and humans due to the limited amount of clinical data in humans.",25.58428636023038,9.750555034876085

Samples taken from fatal human cases of SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections often do not represent the full range of the different temporal stages of a disease. Instead, they are more likely to represent late-stage disease. In addition, the lesions caused by the viral infection may be complicated by lesions caused by clinical treatments and concurrent preexisting disease. Therefore, to be able to study the course of the disease caused by these viruses, good animal models are necessary for SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections in man. Good animal models for SARS and influenza in man should ideally show virus replication dynamics, clinical illness and pathological changes that resemble those of human cases. The choice and design of an animal model used in an experiment is crucial for the outcome of the investigation and should be considered carefully. Time course experiments provide information about the temporal and spatial dynamics that help to design such animal models, including which time points and which samples are best to gain the most useful information (van den Brand et al., 2012a) . Not only the best time points and analyses of the most informative samples should be considered carefully, but also the animal species, the inoculation route and the age of the animals are important, as is shown by studies of H5N1 influenza in ferrets and of SARS in aged mice and macaques (Rockx et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2010; Bodewes et al., 2011) . Taken together, animal models should be designed specifically to address the aspect of SARS or influenza in man that one is interested in, since no one animal model can hope to address all the variation that is inherent in these viral diseases.",24.978146548663496,10.970322768348677

In vitro culture systems play an essential role in evaluating the potency or cytokine profile of a particular adjuvant, while animal models are needed to evaluate preclinical safety and efficacy. Not only is an intact immune system necessary to fully evaluate the protective efficacy of an adjuvanted vaccine, but the expression of TLR4 ligands is variable between different tissues and animals [51] . TLR4 ligands exhibit species-specific phenotypic variability in regard to their adjuvant and toxicity profiles [21] . In fact, a Lipid A precursor, tetraacylated lipid IVa, has been shown to be an agonist in murine cells but to antagonize human TLR4 [52] . Potent human TLR4 agonists, namely the Ugi compounds, have been described that have little or no activity in the range of preclinical models including mouse, rat, rabbit, ferret, and cotton rat cells [50] . Species-specific structural differences between the human and mouse TLR4/MD-2 complex have been identified which affect how the receptor interacts with a given ligand [21] .

In contrast, HeV appears less transmissible in nature and naturally acquired infections of only bats, horses and humans have been described, but experimentally HeV will infect guinea pigs and cats (reviewed in [78] . The use of smaller animal models to study pathogenisis and aid in the efficacy studies of vaccines and therapeutics has been problematic for both HeV and NiV. Neither virus appears capable of infecting and causing reproducible disease in mice or rabbits and infection of guinea pigs has also met with variable results, and to date, the only small animal model in use is with NiV in the golden hamster (reviewed in [79] ). Presently, among reported findings, the golden hamster and cat represent the available suitable animal models to examine the severe pathogenic processes of NiV or HeV infection and have been used in challenge experiments in the evaluation of potential antiviral therapeutics (reviewed in [79] ). A vaccination and challenge study with NiV was carried out in a hamster model using recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding full-length NiV F or G [81] . As expected, this approach did elicit neutralizing antibodies against NiV and was able to protect the animals from lethal disease. Although effective, neither of these platforms is likely to be a viable vaccine candidate for use in humans. Further, because of their BSL4 classification and highly pathogenic nature the development of live-attenuated HeV or NiV vaccines is also doubtful.

Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans.

It is important to note that although preferable, it is not always necessary to demonstrate a beneficial result of a specific medical countermeasure in two disease models. The NHP will always be considered as the apex model for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics against highly pathogenic viruses, and in some situations the only appropriate model. For example, many agents discussed in this article are known to have immunomodulatory effects in humans. Although proof of concept experiments could be performed in small animal models, based on the vast differences in the immune systems of humans and rodents, any therapy aimed at reversing or minimizing deleterious immune responses associated with specific viral agents could only accurately be modeled in NHPs and possibly humanized mice. Under appropriate study conditions most if not all disease models, even those which do not completely meet the criteria set forth by the FDA, can be utilized to address specific scientific questions; therefore in the correct settings these models will provide valuable information regarding pathogenesis and/or therapeutic or vaccine efficacy.

Guinea pigs models are available for wild-type (nonhost adapted) Lassa and Lujo viruses, and although further characterization is necessary, these models should qualify as appropriate disease models. The use of hamsters in this line of research is gaining interest and in the past few years models for Andes virus (HPS), Nipah and Hendra viruses have been comprehensively characterized and should be considered as first line models for these agents.

However, there is a significant need to develop efficacious vaccines for several existing as well as emerging respiratory infectious diseases. Several challenges need to be overcome to develop efficacious vaccines with translational potential. This review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers -1) the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines, and 2) the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases that will allow for translation. Nanoparticle-based vaccines, including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers, as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development. These include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens, target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells, enable cross-protection against divergent strains, act as adjuvants or immunomodulators, allow for sustained release of antigen, enable single dose delivery, and potentially obviate the cold chain. While mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases, they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic. An overview of different animal models involved in vaccine research for respiratory infections, with advantages and disadvantages of each model, is discussed.

Using 86 data points, the PPV among pregnant women without asthma was 40%, while the NPV was 61.3%, giving an overall PPV of 37.6% and NPV of 76.8%. Receiver Operator Curves were constructed (e- Figure 3 ), but these did not allow a CCQ total score cut-off which was associated with PCR positive infection to be determined. The CCQ has good negative predictive value, and is therefore useful in identifying when infections are unlikely to be present. ",25.059361647227675,10.955175445209687

However, a commercial safe and efficacious vaccine for HIV-1 is still not available and is unlikely in the near future, despite exhaustive efforts in HIV-1 vaccine development that began 20 years ago immediately after the initial characterization of HIV-1. 566 Several serious issues that must be resolved for future vaccine success include identification of immune correlates of protection against either lentivirus infection or virus-associated disease. The apparent difficulty of addressing this question was predictable since virus elimination has not been observed during natural infection with immunodeficiency-inducing lentiviruses, even when strong virus-specific cellular and humoral immune responses have been detected in the infected host. Vaccine-induced protection against pathogenic challenge has been difficult to achieve in both the SIV and FIV animal models, and when observed, has been inconsistent. An additional complication is presented by the specter of vaccine-induced immune responses that prove detrimental rather than protective as reported for FIV and more recently in the SIV animal model. The complication of virus strain diversity has barely been addressed by vaccine design in animal models and surely poses a major complication for HIV-1 vaccine success in the future. Successful resolution of these obstacles in vaccine development, and most particularly the lack of understanding of why some vaccines such as attenuated viruses are sometimes protective, absolutely requires continued examination of viral pathogenesis and host immune responses in animal models including both nonhuman primate and nonprimate lentivirus animal models. Elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms used by these immunodeficiencyinducing lentiviruses during the earliest stages of virus exposure and virus-host interactions will be critical for design of vaccines that will have any potential for sterilizing immunity, if such a goal is possible. Similarly, a far more precise understanding of viral mechanisms for immunodeficiency will also be necessary for design of therapies of immune reconstitution in both acutely and chronically HIV-1-infected hosts, which can only be gained through experimental animal model studies.",24.614274582057508,11.101565842108188

Fourth, translation of the efficacy of novel liposome VADS from animal studies to human trials confronts also many obstacles. At present, various types of the liposome VADSs have been elaborately designed and presented with promising outcomes of immune-boosting activities in, unfortunately, just murine and other small animal models, which may be yet the inappropriate one for a specific vaccine [26] .

The authors detail the complexities of developing a vaccine against a very high consequence pathogen of uncertain etiology that appears only sporadically. Evidence points toward bats as a natural reservoir of EBOV, but efforts are still underway to confirm and define the host and virus associations. Even with such information, it would be highly impractical to attempt vaccinating bats to prevent infection of humans and nonhuman primates because so little is known about the life cycles of the many different species of bats in EBOV endemic regions. Thus, the most likely targets of an EBOV vaccine are at risk laboratory workers and individuals in areas where an epidemic is occurring. In addition, because EBOV and related filoviruses are considered to be biological warfare or bioterrorism threats, efforts have been made to develop a vaccine that could be stockpiled for use in such events. An another vaccine target population is endangered great apes, which appear to be as susceptible to EBOV disease as humans. To date, several vaccine candidates against EBOV have shown promise in laboratory studies, although none have yet progressed toward licensure. As licensure will depend on studies conducted under the Food and Drug Administration's 'Animal Rule' which is described in the paper by Burns, reliable animal models must also be developed.",20.43643551831694,10.894129057902475

Indeed, hMPV infection has been associated with airway hyperresponsiveness in both animal models [12] and humans [13] . The incidence of asthma has increased among HIV-infected children and young adults who receive HAART, and it has been speculated that this may be driven by immune reconstitution, because asthma has been associated with higher CD4 + cell counts [14] .

Less commonly, FCV is associated with conjunctivitis, polyarthritis, and lower airway disease in kittens. Virus isolation can be used to document current infection but takes at least several days for results to return. Because of widespread exposure and vaccination, the positive predictive value of serologic tests is poor. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays can be used to amplify the RNA of FCV, and results can be returned quickly. However, these assays also amplify vaccine strains of FCV. 27 FCV RNA can be amplified from samples collected from normal carrier cats as well as clinically ill cats and so have poor positive predictive value. 24 For example, in one study in our laboratory, presence of FCV RNA failed to correlate with the presence or absence of stomatitis in cats. 26 In addition, amplification of FCV RNA cannot be used to prove virulent systemic calicivirus infection. The negative predictive value for FCV RT-PCR assays is currently unknown. Feline caliciviruses, as RNA viruses, have genetic variability among the different strains. Depending on the viral genetic region targeted by the assay, the degree of genetic variation among strains at that site will vary. Most laboratories design their assays to target conserved regions of the viral genome, but even this cannot guarantee that all strains are detectable by any individual assay. FHV-1 is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of rhinitis, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and facial dermatitis. Because of widespread exposure and vaccination, the positive predictive value of serologic tests is poor. FHV-1 can be documented by direct fluorescent staining of conjunctival scrapings, virus isolation, or PCR. FHV-1 DNA can be amplified from conjunctiva, nasal discharges, and pharynx of healthy cats, and so, the positive predictive value of conventional PCR assays is low. 34 Currently used PCR assays also detect vaccine strains of FHV-1, further lessening the positive predictive value of the assays. 21 In one study in our laboratory, presence of FHV-1 DNA failed to correlate with the presence or IFA-negative cats with unexplained small bowel diarrhea and when the genotype of Cryptosporidium is to be determined. However, C. felis infection in cats is common, and so, positive tests results do not always prove that the agent is the cause of the clinical disease. No drug is known to eliminate Cryptosporidium spp. infections, and small animal strains are not considered significant zoonotic agents; so, PCR is never indicated in healthy animals.",28.08563190208511,14.302258093429831

Even when the pharmaceutical industry recognizes the market potential of a vaccine against an emerging pathogen, such as HIV or hepatitis C virus, there are many difficult steps between the desire to develop the vaccine and its availability for purchase. There are more steps from the discovery of a newly EID agent to the availability of a vaccine against it than for a pathogen that has been studied for decades or more than a century. First, the pathogen must be characterized at the levels of biology, molecular composition, and its genome. Even well into the contemporary molecular, proteomic, and genomic era, knowledge of the proteome and genetic sequence provides no more complete understanding of the agent than possession of an encyclopedia, which written in a language that has been translated only partly, would impart omniscience . Second, appropriate animal models that adequately mimic the pathology of the human disease, anatomic distribution of the agent, and the human immune response to the infection must be developed. There are numerous agents that are so highly adapted to humans that no adequate animal model exists. Other models utilize animal species that do not permit effective analysis of the protective immune response owing to lack of reagents to evaluate the immune cells and proteins and absence of animals that are genetically inbred or have knockout of specific genes. Third, studies of animal models and of humans and their cells, cytokines, and antibodies are employed to elucidate the mechanisms of protective immunity. Development of a vaccine that stimulates the presence of memory cells that generate the immune components required to kill the invading pathogen rapidly requires determining which elements (e.g., antibodies, CD4, and/or CD8 T lymphocytes) are critical. Fourth, the antigens of the particular infectious agent that stimulate the protective memory immune components must be identified. For subunit vaccines, some antigens stimulate protective responses, and others suppress protective immunity. Fifth, the animal models are utilized to develop and test vaccine candidates that stimulate protective memory immune responses without harmful side effects. At the point of the primary identification of the etiology of the emerging infection, it would be unlikely that any of these five steps would have been addressed.",25.890880323389666,12.808246747581983

The first is the potential for immunogenicity to the molecule that could curtail its efficacy and/or safety in repeated treatments. The present animal studies were not suited to address the potential immunogenicity of AvFc, because the Fc domain of AvFc is of human origin, which itself would be immunogenic in mice and monkeys. Given that experimental animal models have a limited predictive value for the assessment of therapeutic protein immunogenicity in humans, 41,42 the use of AvFc variants with a species-specific Fc domain is, at least, essential to address the immunogenicity question in preclinical studies. Should this, indeed, be an issue, several potential remedies may be tested to minimize immunogenicity, including T cell epitope deletion, pegylation, and others, though these studies were beyond the scope of the present report. Second, AvFc showed a relatively short serum halflife of 27.7 h in rhesus macaques ( Figure 6C ). This may be, in part, due to slightly decreased affinity to FcRn compared to a human IgG1 isotype control, as shown in Table 1 . A potential solution may be the modification of the Fc region to improve FcRn affinity, such as those described by Zalevsky et al. 43 Additionally, studies are underway to determine the biodistribution profile and off-target binding potential of AvFc. While normal cells do not typically display high amounts of HMGs at their surface, these immature glycans have been found to be enriched in the plasma membranes of cancer cells [44] [45] [46] and embryonic stem cells. 47, 48 A future study should carefully evaluate what cell types other than HIV-or SIV-infected cells are recognized by AvFc.",25.407447200717765,10.959865793184223

Limited availability of human pathologic specimens during early RSV-induced lung disease and ethical restrictions for RSV challenge studies in the lower airways of human volunteers has slowed our understanding of how RSV causes airway disease and greatly limited the development of therapeutic strategies for reducing RSV disease burden. Our current knowledge of RSV infection and pathology is largely based on in vitro studies using nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines grown on plastic or in vivo studies using animal models semipermissive for RSV infection. Although these models have revealed important aspects of RSV infection, replication, and associated inflammatory responses, these models do not broadly recapitulate the early interactions and potential consequences of RSV infection of the human columnar airway epithelium in vivo. In this chapter, the pro et contra of in vitro models of human columnar airway epithelium and their usefulness in respiratory virus pathogenesis and vaccine development studies will be discussed.

Antigen-specific IgE titers have excellent positive predictive value for clinical allergic reactivity in individuals with markedly increased titers but poor negative predictive value in those with low titers, necessitating food trials for these individuals (Sampson, 2005) . Moreover, analysis of IgE titers and passive cutaneous skin assays require repetitive prior exposure for development of sensitization. Thus, there is a need for a rapid and accurate screening assay with a high negative predictive value of allergenicity for the valuation of allergenicity of novel foods or the effects of novel food processing methods on common foods. These biomarkers should be derived from reliable, validated, and relevant animal models and should be quantifiable and proportional to the degree of allergenicity of the food and should be detectable during both sensitization and post-challenge anaphylaxis.

Several animal models have been evaluated for SARS-and MERS CoVs including mouse, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, rabbits, rhesus macaques, marmosets, and cats. 42, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Early effort was directed in developing animal models for SARS-CoV, but the specificity of the virus to ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV) was a major hindrance to such efforts. Later, a SARS-CoV transgenic mouse model was developed by introducing hACE2 gene into the mouse genome. 51 The first animal model used for developing a MERS-CoV vaccine was rhesus macaques. Infected animals showed clinical symptoms such as increased body temperature, piloerection, cough, hunched posture, and reduced food intake. 52 Another frequently used animal model for MERS-CoV is the common marmoset, wherein the virus caused lethal pneumonia. 53 Humoral and cell-mediated immunity could be detected in both rhesus macaques and common marmoset following MERS-CoV immunization. 43 47 These hamsters are a potential model for studying CoV pathology and pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. The attenuated NSP16 CoV vaccine was studied in mice. 54 Attempts to develop animal models for MERS-CoV such as mice, hamsters, and ferrets face limitations due to the inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of these species. Small animals (mice or hamsters) resisting natural infection with MERS-CoVs (which are susceptible to SARS-CoV) have been genetically modified to a more humanized structure, e.g., hDPP4 human, hDPP4-transduced, and hDPP4-Tg mice (transgenic for expressing hDPP4), and ascertained for susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. 55 Alteration in the mouse genome using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool could make the animals susceptible to CoV infection and virus replication. 56 Genetic engineering was used in the generation of 288-330 +/+ MERS-CoV mouse model, which is being used for the evaluation of novel MERS-CoV vaccines and drugs. 57 Compared to the large animal models, small animals such as mice and rabbits are preferred due to lower cost, ease of manipulation, and readily available efficacy methods. 43 Further studies are needed to recognize suitable models for emerging SARS-CoV-2 by identifying receptor affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and studying disease manifestations, pathologies/viral pathogenesis associated with experimental inoculation of the virus in mice, rats, and other models, as well as examining virus-specific immune responses and protection.

The use of wild models may also facilitate the inclusion of a more diverse set of organisms in infectious disease research, allowing for increasingly powerful comparative studies.

Further, passive immunotherapy using convalescent phase human plasma is being considered in MERS patients after its success in animal models .

Other models have also examined the use of a lympho-venous shunt which has the advantage of allowing sampling of lymph over much longer periods, although in this case the relatively small database for lymph flow rates makes estimation of the absolute extent of lymphatic transport difficult [63] .

In addition to the three Rs, the committee stressed the importance of using methods to develop animal models that will transfer to a culture of good laboratory practices for the development of MCM. In the past, many investigations relied on the similarities in the phenotypic presentation of disease in animals compared to humans, rather than similarities in the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. By relying on phenotypic similarities and assumed absolute conservation of molecular processes in closely related animals of different species, investigators have raised doubts about the ability of existing animal models to accurately recapitulate human disease or predict efficacy of candidate therapeutics in humans (Seok et al., 2013) . In addition, the scientific, funding, and regulatory communities realize that one animal model may not recapitulate all aspects of disease. Expectation of uniform or near uniform lethality from pathogen challenge is neither reasonable or in all cases appropriate. As a result, with the use of alternative endpoints besides lethality, investigators can evaluate MCM in nonlethal models rather than forcing a disease course more severe than the human condition.",24.606577323286736,9.678348235530805

However, reports of immunopathologic reactions in older mice and in non-human primates vaccinated with SARS-CoV vaccines that were subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [57, 59, 62, 64] have revealed two concerns about proceeding to clinical trials with SARS-CoV vaccines. First, there is a precedent for coronavirus-vaccine associated disease enhancement; kittens immunized with a vaccinia virus vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus vaccines developed severe disease when they were subsequently infected with FIPV [65] . In these kittens, non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies facilitated viral entry into macrophages. The concern that is extrapolated from the FIPV vaccine experience to human SARS-CoV vaccines is whether vaccine recipients will develop more severe disease if they are exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV after neutralizing antibody titers decline. The second concern is whether recipients of a SARSCoV vaccine would be at risk of developing pulmonary immunopathology following infection with an unrelated human coronavirus e.g. 229E, OC43, HKU1 or NL63 that usually causes mild, self limited disease. Although findings from preclinical evaluation have revealed these concerns, studies in animal models may not be able to provide data to confirm or allay these concerns. Factors to consider when selecting an animal model. Animal models should be tailored to the goals of the study. If the primary goal is to elucidate pathogenesis, the model should replicate key aspects of the disease and immunological reagents should be available. The demographic background (e.g. age for SARS) of the animal should be taken into consideration. In contrast, animal models used in vaccine/antiviral efficacy studies must demonstrate meaningful differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated control groups. Special consideration should be given to how animals from different demographic backgrounds respond to the vaccine/antiviral under investigation. To determine the correlate of protection, it is necessary to study the immune response to the vaccine as well as the immune response elicited after challenge with the homologous coronavirus. It may be of interest to evaluate the response to challenge with other coronaviruses that the vaccinated host may encounter. Gretebeck Table 1 Coronaviruses associated with disease in humans.

The use of this test was later expanded to include the ability to test asymptomatic contacts of a person infected with MERS-CoV who traveled from Saudi Arabia to the United States. The CDC made this test available to multiple US public health laboratories, the US Department of Defense, and WHO laboratories worldwide. Although the test has been distributed extensively, it is limited in terms of the CDC's ability to scale up the supply of reagents to support a surge in MERS-CoV cases in the United States and in other countries where the test has been made available. Therefore, an emergency use authorization was issued on July 17, 2015, for the commercially developed RealStar MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit U.S. (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) for use in the in vitro qualitative detection of MERS-CoV RNA in tracheal aspirate or tracheal secretion samples (31) . Although this commercial assay is a first step in bridging the diagnostic test availability gap in case of a surge scenario, the current coverage, at least in the United States, is insufficient until alternative, FDA-cleared commercial tests are available (Table 2) .",19.31527925122626,11.24414320196804

Animal models are poorly predictive, and even immunological parameters in humans, like the induction of pathogen-neutralizing antibody responses, are not fully predictive. As a result, vaccine effi cacy has to be measured in terms of reduction of disease. This is sometimes very diffi cult because symptoms of a disease can be caused by more than one pathogen (e.g., infl uenzalike illness). To measure protection, one has to detect the infl uenza virus in the group with infl uenza-like illness. In addition, to measure reduction of disease, the groups in the trial need to be very large because it is unknown who will get the disease. Sometimes tens of thousands of people are included in phase 3 trials. Systems biology approaches that may limit these problems in the future are under development. The idea is to identify gene signatures that correlate with a protective immune response. This is done by a combination of gene expression analysis for, e.g., lymphocytes in the blood and functional assays like measurement of antibodies, cytokines, and cellular responses. Bioinformaticians try to unravel pathways and networks of genes involved in immune responses. Eventually, it may be possible to assign the activity of a limited number of genes to protective immune responses (Nakaya et al. 2011 ) . Perhaps that such gene signatures can be used in future clinical trials (Pulendran et al. 2010 ). This approach would allow for reduction of the size of clinical studies, reduce the risk of late stage failure, and assess the signifi cance of animal models in the preclinical phase of vaccine development.",23.475013461645393,11.55526276869335

Since we here have multiple independent sets for our model validation, we tested the performance of our final prediction model simultaneously on six diverse test sets of in vivo animal and in vitro human liver cells across >160 diverse compounds.

HMPV, being a RNA virus, is highly prone to mutation and development of an effective vaccine candidate is a challenge, yet research on the development of a universal vaccine candidate is underway. Inactivated vaccine candidates against HMPV have not yet been successfully tested in animal models with most of them leading to enhanced disease severity upon subsequent natural infection. On the other hand, vaccination with subunit vaccine composed either of purified HMPV fusion protein or the fusion protein expressed via different viral or bacterial vectors viz. retroviral vector, alphavirus vector, rBCG etc. could induce protective immunity against both homologous as well as heterologous strains of the virus, though for a short duration. Fusion protein based VLPs in combination with certain adjuvants like TiterMax Gold are also highly immunogenic and protective against the virus. Though the inactivated or subunit vaccines are safe but the requirement of booster doses and lack of strong cellular immune response poses a limitation on its use. The live attenuated viruses overcome this limitation. Recombinant approach to develop live attenuated viral vaccine candidate through reverse genetics technique can be considered as one of the best approach, provided a good level of attenuation is attained and immunogenicity is maintained. Attempts to generate live attenuated HMPV vaccine candidates have been successful with good protective efficacy in rodents and non-human primates but none of them have yet entered the clinical trials.

Further development of MERS-CoV and other CoV vaccines thus needs proactive collaborative efforts from researchers filling knowledge gaps, and market stakeholders providing funding for this costly process. The latter can be insufficient and/or unsustainable, therefore hindering development of even some promising candidates. In an initiative aiming at accelerating vaccine R&D process by providing sustained funding to be prepared for future epidemics, the World Economic Forum launched the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) [80] . CEPI is an international non-profit association aiming at removing barriers facing vaccine development for epidemic infections and getting ready for future epidemics, including MERS-CoV. However, we still face a number of challenges despite the fact that various promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidates are currently available. There is a lack of animal models mimicking the disease in humans in which vaccine platforms can be tested prior to human use. We need to take into account the populations to target with vaccination, with camels and camel handlers being the most relevant ones. The lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis and immune responses to the virus in humans and camels, which is crucial for vaccine development, also needs further investments. In addition, the longevity of immune responses post-vaccination has not been evaluated for vaccine candidates, which is important for the vaccination scheme development and for the choice of the best candidates for further development. Lastly, most of the vaccine candidates are developed against the highly variable spike protein and thus may not be able to provide protection against CoV strains evolving in the future. A more targeted vaccination approach aiming at conserved epitopes should be considered for the development of a more broadly-acting CoV vaccine. Given the propensity of CoVs to jump the species barrier, current efforts to develop a MERS-CoV vaccine may also be of benefit to prepare for potential novel CoVs that may emerge in the future.",20.937145163536982,11.095601808500609

The more specific case definition uses diagnostic criteria for DHF outlined by the WHO, so it is not surprising that a higher proportion of patients were positive by serology (33% vs 7%) and virus isolation (50% vs 15%) using the latter case definition. Barbazan et al. used retrospective surveillance data to show that the spatial analysis would allow focusing control activities on 5% of the months to control 37% of cases, and early warning of epidemics could have been done in advance. 28 Chan et al. used web search query data to build a model that estimated ‗true dengue activity'. 32 They showed good correlation of their predictive model with retrospective data using datasets from Indonesia and Singapore.",17.583683912584075,8.02989312571298

Alterations in proteolytic activity occur during pathological conditions such as cancer. One of the major deregulated classes of proteases in cancer is caspases, the proteolytic initiators and mediators of the apoptotic machinery. The ability to image apoptosis noninvasively in living cells and animal models of cancer can not only provide new insight into the biological basis of the disease but can also be used as a quantitative tool to screen and evaluate novel therapeutic strategies. Optical molecular imaging such as bioluminescence-based genetically engineered biosensors has been developed in our laboratory and exploited to study protease activity in animal models with a high signal to noise. Using the circularly permuted form of firefly luciferase, we have developed a reporter for Caspase 3/7, referred to as Caspase 3/7 GloSensor. Here, we discuss the use of the Caspase 3/7 GloSensor for imaging apoptotic activity in mouse xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer and present the potential of this powerful platform technology to image the proteolytic activity of numerous other proteases.",17.358125806728367,7.764924170382596

The attraction to rAd5 for immunization has followed from its success with a variety of preclinical animal models and with human trials in phase 1 or 2. With respect to animal models, the replication-defective adenovirus has been shown to elicit potent immune responses and protection against Ebola virus, administered either alone as a single injection, or in primeboost combinations. 155,156 The prime-boost approach induces a more potent and durable immunity, desirable for a preventive vaccine in routine use, whereas a single rAd vaccination induces a more rapid response that is sufficient for immediate protection (Figure 62-2) . This latter approach may be useful in containing acute outbreaks of Ebola infection and could be applicable to other pathogens. 33 In addition, both rAd5 vaccines and DNA prime/rAd5 boost combinations have been shown to confer partial protection in rhesus macaques against multiple HIV isolates, including SHIV-89.6P, 31,157 SIVmac239, 158 and SIVmac251. 159-161 Replication-defective adenovirus has also been used in a variety of additional animal models of infectious disease, including plague, anthrax, influenza, and malaria. 45 Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies with replication-defective adenoviral vectors for HIV-1 have been developed independently by the Merck research laboratories and the NIH VRC in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The Merck vaccine used only rAd5 vectors and encoded the Gag, Pol, and Nef genes of HIV-1. A clinical efficacy study of this product, called the STEP trial, began in 2005; it evaluated the effect of vaccineinduced T-cell responses to these gene products internal to the virus on controlling viral load. Despite the immunogenicity of this vaccine, no reduction in acquisition or long-term control of postinfection viremia was observed. 162 Further analyses revealed that persons with specific human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) types, as well as those who developed a CD8 + T-cell response to certain Gag and Nef HIV epitopes, selected against viruses that contained the vaccine epitope in vivo. 163 There was also an unexpected association between infection in vaccine recipients and those who were both uncircumcised and immune to Ad5 before vaccination. The rate of HIV infection during the first 18 months after the immunization regimen was higher in this subgroup.

In this regard, animal models have been employed extensively for investigations of HCP pathogenesis and as well as for the identification of novel therapeutics and evaluation of their associated efficacies/toxicities. Murine models have been employed extensively for examining HCP pathogenesis due to their relative cost, limited genetic background (and thus increased experimental reproducibility), and the availability of analytical reagents. Recently, Seok et al. (2013) reported that the genomic responses of laboratory mice in acute inflammatory disease models correlated poorly with those of human patients.

Hence, data from such models is largely ignored when safety determinations are made on new vaccines containing these 'grandfathered' adjuvants. Regulators instead focus on vaccine safety data collected in rabbits or guinea pigs together with data from human clinical trials to assess vaccine safety [137] . Notably, there remains a need for better scientific explanation as to why specific animal model data showing adjuvant toxicity is not relevant to human use. For example, it has been know for many years that squalene oil emulsions either alone or when formulated with relevant antigens can induce autoimmune conditions, e.g. adjuvant arthritis [138] , in geneticallysusceptible animals. Hence, a consumer might reasonably ask why this animal toxicity data does not predict the possibility of the adjuvant causing autoimmune disease in human subjects who are also genetically susceptible. There is not currently any good answer to this question. Given the narcolepsy cases associated with use of a pandemic influenza vaccine containing AS03 squalene oil emulsion adjuvant [19, 20] , is it reasonable to ask whether the AS03 adjuvant was tested for its propensity to induce autoimmune disease in geneticallysusceptible animal models? Even if the influenza antigen in this vaccine turned out to be responsible for inducing narcolepsy, e.g. through a process of antigen mimicry, it is still plausible that the AS03 adjuvant played a role in breaking self-tolerance just as inflammatory adjuvants are critical to disease induction in models such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis [139] . One possible mechanism worth investigating is whether the AS03 adjuvant induced an excessive Th17 response leading to opening of the bloodbrain gate to autoreactive T cells induced by influenza antigen mimicry [140] .",27.060166090144158,13.516195834969187

Hence, the best that can be done is to assess whether causation is plausible or not using knowledge of a particular vaccine's or adjuvant's mechanism of actions. Even in situations where causation is held to be probable, such as in the case of the specific pandemic influenza vaccine and childhood narcolepsy, it is still not possible to identify which vaccine component(s) is responsible, such as the relative contribution of the antigen or adjuvant, if present. Whilst animal models might seem the best solution for testing causation of adverse reactions, direct extrapolation from such models is difficult with no guarantee they accurately reflect the human context. Hence all vaccine adjuvant safety assessments are subjective in nature.

In this situation it would be useful to identify in vitro surrogates of adjuvant toxicity using human cell lines or primary cells, with readouts such as potency of cytokine induction [146] . Unfortunately, such in vitro approaches may have limited value as they cannot recapitulate the complexity of adjuvant action in vivo. For example, many adjuvants including aluminum have little effect on cytokine production in vitro and yet have potent adjuvant effects in vivo. Furthermore, toxicity may occur in distant and unexpected tissue compartments such as the hepatotoxicity seen with injection of NKT cell agonists [135] . Hence, assessment of adjuvant potency, tolerability and safety will continue to require in vivo testing.

Each of these types of compounds is likely to have very different toxicities. All TLR agonists activate the inflammatory transcription factor, NFkB, through the TLR adaptor proteins, MYD88 and TRIF [90] . A consequence of NFkB activation in monocytes is production of pyrogens and inflammatory cytokines thereby resulting in potential for dose-limiting inflammation and pyrexia [91] . Attempts to detoxify TLR agonists inevitably lead to some loss of adjuvant activity. This is exemplified by conversion of highly toxic TLR4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide, to the less toxic monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) [92] . Given its modest potency MPL needs to be combined with aluminum or other adjuvants for best effect [92] . AS04 is an example of a combination adjuvant of MPL and aluminum adjuvant and is included in an approved prophylactic hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine for low responder renal dialysis patients [93] and a prophylactic human papilloma virus vaccine [94] . HBV-AS04 vaccine was more locally reactogenic than a standard aluminum adjuvanted vaccine with pain at the injection site occurring with 41% of HBV-AS04, versus 19% of standard vaccine, doses, consistent with increased vaccine reactogenicity due to the MPL component [93] . In animal models, TLR4 adjuvants have been shown to cause aberrant immune responses associated with toxicity [95] . For example, inclusion of a TLR4 agonist with an intranasal influenza vaccine in mice caused exacerbated illness and death when immunized animals were challenged with influenza, with the exacerbated lung pathology subsequently found to be due to the TLR4 agonist inducing an excessive IL17 response [95] . TLR4 agonists have also been shown to be able to break tolerance and induce autoimmunity in susceptible animal models [96] . For example, TLR4 agonists, just like the inflammatory agents, trehalose dimycolate, β-glucan, pristane and squalene oil, are potent inducers of inflammatory arthritis in susceptible strains [96] .

Numerous species of NHPs have been used, including baboons, African green monkey, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, to study filovirus pathogenesis because the pathology of infected NHPs is similar to that seen in humans (Bente et al., 2009; Geisbert et al., 2003b) . The sporadic nature of disease outbreaks and the ethical issues associated with conducting a human vaccine trial make such a study difficult to execute. Early-stage development of vaccines has historically occurred in mouse and guinea pig models of filovirus disease, but these models use adapted viruses obtained through sequential passage in the rodent species because the wild-type virus does not cause uniform lethality (Bray et al., 1999; Connolly et al., 1999) . The disease observed in rodents does not reproduce the extensive disseminated intravascular coagulation seen in human filovirus disease. Besides the requirement for an adapted virus, there are reports that the rodent models are not necessarily predictive of efficacy in NHPs (Feldmann et al., 2003; Geisbert et al., 2002; Jahrling et al., 1996) . NHPs are relevant models to study infectious disease as their immune system is similar to humans and they are good predictors of efficacy in vaccine development and other intervention strategies. Licensure of a filovirus vaccine will require testing in a NHP species. The macaque model is the most frequently used model in filovirus efficacy studies involving vaccines or therapies. Given the drawbacks of rodent models of filovirus disease, there is a critical need for development of a small animal model that develops disease consistent with human infection using wild-type virus.",24.71135738977443,11.688171684950866

Ideally an animal model should reproduce the hallmarks of human disease as closely as possible in an immunocompetent animal following a realistic dose of challenge virus via an appropriate inoculation route (Safronetz, Geisbert, and Feldmann, 2013 ). An important component of the FDA's Animal Rule, which concerns the approval of new drugs when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible, states that FDA will rely on evidence from animal studies if the animal models used are expected to react with a response predictive of humans or a single animal model is sufficiently characterized to predict the human response (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration, 2014).

However, while DNA vaccines have proved effective in animal models, they have continued to suffer because of suboptimal human immunogenicity. Hence, a major frustration in the DNA vaccine field is the inability to predict human vaccine responses based on mouse immunogenicity data. This means that quantitative differences observed between different DNA vaccine approaches in mice rarely translate to humans. For example, electroporation or cytokine adjuvants that may deliver 100-1000-fold improvements in antibody titers in mice may deliver at best a two-to three-fold improvement in titers in humans. Thus, small animal models that are typically used in adjuvant comparison studies are more likely to be misleading than informative, and instead the field would be advised to only use large animal models or best of all humans to undertake adjuvant comparison studies. Hence, while major advances to DNA vaccine design have moved them closer to their true potential for human use, head-tohead human comparative studies of the different DNA vaccine technologies are required to enable selection of the most effective technology for a given disease. Improvements have been made in plasmid construction, such as codon optimization and removal of cryptic splice sites, the use of molecular adjuvants, electroporation and intradermal needle-free injection, and heterologous prime-boost strategies. Among recent promising advances is the use of cytokine, chemokine or costimulatory molecules as molecular adjuvants in DNA vaccines. When combined with strategies to enhance antigen expression, such as electroporation or intradermal needleless injection, molecular adjuvant approaches have the potential to significantly enhance DNA vaccine immunogenicity. The large number of ongoing human clinical trials of DNA vaccines is a testament to the belief that DNA vaccines will ultimately deliver on their potential [2] . Given the regulatory challenges it is most likely that the first DNA vaccine breakthroughs will be in the area of therapeutic vaccines for cancer, with infectious disease applications following much later. This is reflected in the fact that cancer indications currently represent the largest group of human DNA vaccine trials. To realize the full potential of DNA vaccines there is an ongoing need for research into their mechanisms of action and, in particular, into strategies to further enhance their immunogenicity. Such research should allow one or more human therapeutic cancer DNA vaccines to achieve licensure within the next 5-7 years. • Good safety record in human studies",31.1015822422324,14.688925750666503

Plenty of treatment modalities were developed on the basis of animal experimentations. Meanwhile, there is an increasing number of failed clinical trials, particularly on chronic and complex diseases that biased from the results of studies on inappropriate animal models [4, 5] . It is time to ask whether animal models truly predict human health conditions. While validity and acceptability of current successful trials and guidelines are debated in the 21st century because they are not patient tailored, how could we rely on animal models as an appropriate predictor of human conditions? Simplifying a complex system is inevitable to study the basis of a complex phenomenon. However, simplified models do not reflect all the properties of complex systems [4, 6] . When an animal model is used as the basis of a clinical trial, it is needed to mimic the complex properties of the patients. Otherwise, animal models might be misleading; consequently, a large number of therapeutic modalities might have lost in translation [7] . This study was therefore undertaken to provide shreds of evidence against the validity of animal models. It has been systematically discussed why the authors believe that it is time to re-evaluate the validity of animal experimentations. Although plenty of state-of-the-art disease modeling techniques have been introduced recently, their acceptance and application in the medical science society are scarce; nevertheless validity of these modern modeling techniques needs further evaluation as well. There is a gap between bench and bedside that, unfortunately, has not been appropriately filled with the animal models. In our contribution, we want to provide relevant facts which clearly show that translational medicine and PPPM need accurate surrogate for misleading animal models in order to increase the level of the future healthcare. In this article, we review the knowledge on inappropriate modeling of chronic and complex disorders, which is very important point for the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine. The translation medicine in this point has to deal with this problem in order to support further and smooth development of PPPM. It is absolutely essential the experts in all fields of medicine, and beyond, are aware of the described problems. The predictions in PPPM and potential preventive actions may very well be compromised if inappropriate modeling is being widely used in numerous cases, let alone the creation of personalized models for an individual patient. There is a great need and potential for fundamental changes in strategies, leading to substantial improvements in future healthcare.",27.694020124422238,11.292759840936812

Moreover, the size and anatomy of the respiratory tracts of common research animals differ greatly from those in humans. For example, in small animals such as rodents, nose drops may deposit to the entire respiratory tract, which would not be the case in humans. Balmelli and colleagues estimated that 30% of 20 μL of vaccine given to mice as IN drops deposited into the lungs. 767 Many viruses and bacteria that infect humans do not grow well in animal models. For example, species-specific differences in the distribution of sialic acid receptors on cell surfaces is a crucial factor in tissue and host specificity of influenza A viruses, which limits the number of animal models suitable for influenza research. 768 Such species-specific differences can make it difficult to use animals to study attenuated live vaccines or vaccine vectors, as well as to challenge animals to assess protection.

A high negativity predictive value would indicate that the test is useful in excluding the presence of the disease. Another zoonotic agent is Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which can be transmitted via aerosols (Clark et al., 2018) . One study with the intent at looking for improved tests showed the utility of IgM to determine an early exposure to RVFV (Niklasson et al., 1984) . Two ELISA IgM tests detected specific IgM antibodies to RVFV during the first 6 weeks after vaccination. Three inactivated vaccine doses were given on days 0, 6 to 8, and 32 to 34. ELISA serum IgM on days 6e8 were negative or in the lower range of detection; on days 32e34 the serum antibody values were strongly positive; on days 42e52, they were waning and in later collected samples were negative. The plaque reduction neutralization test was negative on days 6e8 and became positive in later samples. Similar to the examples shown above, these data suggest that three doses of RVFV vaccine induced a prolonged primary antibody response. The authors of that study concluded that the ELISA IgM may be useful for early diagnosis of acute human infection.

This includes inbred mice and rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. It may actually be worthwhile to enhance the virulence of a SARS-CoV isolate by serial passages in an animal model to produce a challenge virus stock for vaccine studies that would elicit more reproducible disease in the animals. If a highly virulent host-adapted virus were to become available, such as a mouse-adapted or a monkey-adapted SARS-CoV strain, demonstration of the capacity of vaccines to protect against challenge with these more virulent strains would provide an almost ideal animal model. Different models may also need to be employed to evaluate pathogenesis versus immunogenicity. For pathogenesis studies in animal models, mortality is not required as a readout. It would be ideal to develop animal models with comparable levels of mortality to that seen in humans (∼10% overall), including the increased mortality at increased age (∼50% > age 60). The optimal result would be to demonstrate efficacy of vaccines or antivirals in SARS-CoV animal models that mimic human morbidity and mortality and that show protection without vaccine-associated immunopathology.",30.834784602769936,15.976700959083491

This scoring system has been shown to have a high negative predictive value in some reports (81%), as opposed to its positive predictive value (48%). 5 Some studies show that even patients with all four criteria have less than a 60% chance of having a positive throat culture, which is the gold standard for diagnosis. 1 The utility of a scoring system in making a diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is that it helps to stratify patients into high, medium, or low probability of having the disease. These criteria are used to guide further workup and should be used with additional diagnostic information to confirm GAS. 1, 5 The use of these criteria alone can lead to an incorrect diagnosis of GAS and can increase the use of unnecessary antibiotics.

Successful anti-infectious disease campaigns, for example, often rely on the availability of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics, that in turn, depend on reliable and predictive pre-clinical research. A new study found that the mouse models used extensively to study human inflammatory diseases, including infectious diseases, only poorly mimic the human condition. 39 This calls into question the reliability of mouse models to identify, develop, and test drug and vaccine candidates. 39 Indeed, because of apparent stagnation in the invention of useful drugs, leaders in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have argued that poor predictability of animal testing is among the chief challenges facing the drug discovery community. 40 The stresses induced in the laboratory can affect animals' physiology and perturb study results. 41, 42 This begs the question: How relevant is animal testing for predicting human health outcomes?

One may pay particular attention to differences in how a pathogen is delivered in nature (i.e., mosquito, superficial dermis, salivary proteins) and how this may or may not translate depending on how we deliver in the context of vaccination (i.e., needle, intramuscular or subcutaneous, no salivary proteins). Note added after review: Back correlations between efficacious vaccines and mechanisms of protection should be carried out to derive correlates of protection. Alternative approaches using in vitro organoids and ex vivo studies should be used to supplement live animal models, although their role in supporting product development is uncertain. Several other parameters of animal models can be poorly reflective of the human infection and disease experience. For example, the time course of infection in animal models can be remarkably different from humans. Further, lethal challenge models (e.g., Nipah) do not provide endpoints suitable for translation to clinical trials. Model relevance was also discussed in the context of a Zika pregnancy model in immunocompetent mice, in which the infected dams did not get viremia and there was no detectable vertical transmission of virus, yet there was virtually 100% fetal demise. Monoclonal antibody blocking studies indicated that, despite the absence of productive infection, the pathology was apparently caused by virus, raising the possibility of fetal demise due to specific placental pathology [7] . There would be great value in developing high quality, standardized animal models and challenge strains of particular pathogens that are broadly accepted. Following Good Laboratory Practices within high bio-containment required for handling some pathogens is difficult and could impact countermeasure development efforts in these areas. Note added after review: Emphasis should be placed on working with biocontainment labs to get as close to GLP compliance as possible.

This review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers -1) the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines, and 2) the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases that will allow for translation. Nanoparticle-based vaccines, including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers, as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development. These include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens, target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells, enable cross-protection against divergent strains, act as adjuvants or immunomodulators, allow for sustained release of antigen, enable single dose delivery, and potentially obviate the cold chain. While mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases, they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic.

Clearly, the pathogenesis of disease can only be studied in animal models that replicate key aspects of the disease. But animal models do not need to replicate all aspects of disease to provide useful information in evaluation of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis. For example, an animal model can be useful in vaccine efficacy studies if the following two criteria are met: (i) virus titer correlates with disease severity; and (ii) the virus replicates in the animal model to a sufficiently high titer so that differences in the level of replication between immunized and mock-immunized control groups can be meaningfully distinguished.

Considering that most novel vaccine technologies (other than killed or attenuated vaccines) need to adapt the current production processes, many vaccines will never develop further enough to reach market. Nonetheless, animal vaccine research is a very attractive research fi eld with many advantages and complexity over human vaccine fi eld. Firstly, due the larger number of target animal species or segments (ruminant livestock, poultry, porcine, equine, companion animals, aquaculture, and other animal vaccines), secondly, the lack of deep knowledge in the immune mechanisms and lack of reagents adds more difficulties if immune response characterization is needed. The possibility to test the effi cacy of the vaccine prototypes in the target species and study the immune response evoked is one important difference that can speed the process of vaccine development over that of human vaccines. Another important advantage is the possibility of testing more innovative approaches that can be further tested for human vaccine development.",25.857507722737825,12.171578830487384

The two polyproteins need to be cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps), which then assemble into the replication-transcription complex required for genome replication. Nsp5, also termed 3CL protease or main protease (M pro ), mediates proteolysis at 11 distinct cleavage sites, and is essential for virus replication.

One of the most recent examples is the outbreak of Ebola virus (Filoviridae) in West Africa, which started in December of 2013 in Guinea and evolved as the largest Ebola outbreak recorded with more than 28,600 cases [8]. Furthermore, during recent years, outbreaks caused by other emerging viral pathogens from Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae families among others, disturbed public and private health, social networks and the economies of the affected countries [9], [10]. Prevention and control of emerging and reemerging viral diseases is efficient when several actions are combined: i.e. creating diagnostic networks and surveillance programs, training medical and veterinary staff, informing the population about sanitary measures, and also promoting research on prophylaxis, treatments and on the causative agent pathogenesis. Regarding the last point, animal models are crucial to study the viral and host factors contributing to the disease as well as transmission outcomes of virus infection and to allow pre-clinical testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Non-human primates (NHP) are the preferred models for pathogenesis studies, and potential vaccine and treatment testing, as they better translate to humans [11]. However, working with NHP is costly, with limited availability, and raises ethical problems. Therefore small-animal models are usually the first choice for drug screening. The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Rule provides guidelines concerning the appropriateness of animal models for licensing purposes [12]. Additionally, by controlling the disease in animal reservoirs and/or in intermediate hosts, virus transmission to humans can be significantly reduced [13], [14]. This is particularly true for domestic or feral animals for which efficient vaccines and vaccination strategies can be implemented [15]. Therefore, in cases of new pathogenic virus outbreaks, the search for natural hosts or potential target animals (as opposed to laboratory animals) seems to be relevant not only to implement prophylactic solutions but also to improve the preparedness for an eventual global extension of diseases. Nowadays, this task is rendered possible by the availability of improved biosafety levels 3 and 4 (BSL3 and 4) animal facilities, which can accommodate large animal experimentation with such highly virulent pathogens [16].",19.766304431349415,11.10642842282517

In the final logistic regression model, detection of nodules during endoscopy, higher age, and lower body weight were associated with a diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis. Odds of having eosinophilic bronchitis were 34.4% (18.9–62.6; P < 0.001) greater in dogs presenting nodules during endoscopy. The risk of eosinophilic bronchitis increased by 23% (14–32%; P < 0.001) for a one‐year increase in age, and by 3% (0–5%; P = 0.048) for each kilogram decrease in body weight. Visualization of nodules during endoscopy had a sensitivity of 56.6% (47.0–65.9%), specificity of 94.3% (92.3–95.9%), positive predictive value of 62.7% (54.3–70.5%), and negative predictive value of 92.8% (91.2–94.1%). Based on the high specificity and high negative predictive value, visualization of nodules during endoscopy is highly indicative of eosinophilic bronchitis. However, the lack of visualization of nodules during endoscopy does not exclude the presence of eosinophilic bronchitis.",22.798793105418714,10.400444433934819

Interestingly, there are overwhelming advantages in developing animal vaccines in contrast to human vaccine development. One of the most evident advantages is the relative low cost for conducting research and development for animal vaccines as compared with human vaccines. Additionally, there is less regulation on development of animal vaccines and clinical trials than those of human vaccines, since clinical trials for animal vaccines are allowed without preclinical phases that are mandatory steps for developing human vaccines. As a consequence, final animal vaccine products can readily be commercialized within a short period of time. Nevertheless, a smaller profit from the sector of animal vaccines is anticipated due to the lower price of the products and the smaller market, unlike of the human vaccine industry. Animal vaccines currently account for less than one fourth of the global market for animal health products [5]. However, the vaccine production industry has steadily grown because of the increasing demands for new animal vaccines against various pathogens re-emerging in industry animals. Accordingly, the number of licensed animal vaccines for livestock and companion animals has increased over the decade.

The ganciclovir saga, ZMapp, and other experiences raise the question of what to do when a potentially beneficial drug is needed that has not undergone any in-human testing, and furthermore cannot undergo such human studies due to ethical concerns. In 2015, the FDA released a guidance for industry to address “drugs developed to ameliorate or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions caused by exposure to lethal or permanently disabling toxic substances, when human efficacy studies are not ethical and field trials are not feasible” (38). Under certain conditions, the FDA may accept animal studies in lieu of human clinical trials, provided that there is reasonable expectation that the animal studies are predictive of in-human effects. Such conditions may apply not only to individual patient use, but potentially to widespread use during a public health emergency and must meet specific requirements (Table 2) (39). As of now, 12 products have been approved under the Animal Rule, 7 of which were issued quickly after the guidance was published (Table 3) (40). Approval via the Animal Rule is usually subject to several conditions: 1) post-marketing “field” studies must verify and describe the product’s clinical efficacy and safety when such studies are ethical and feasible; 2) restrictions may be imposed to ensure safe use only under the approved labelling (i.e., off-label use may be forbidden); and 3) information must be provided to patients prior to administration regarding the conditions of approval and directions for use, contraindications, foreseeable risks, adverse reactions, and drug interactions.

New vaccine technologies are developed globally and are introduced through various journals to determine more efficient ways of inducing immunity. However, only limited numbers of these developments are adopted as actual human vaccines because of the high level of safety required. The most effective example to explain the difficulty of developing human vaccines is adjuvants. There are many possible adjuvants but alum (aluminum compounds) is the most common commercial adjuvant in current killed vaccines [3]. Various new technologies and adjuvants could not be used because of safety concerns. Before human use, vaccines developed with new technologies or new adjuvants should be approved for each national regulatory authority. For authorization, the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline requires detailed, extensive information, specifically for safety, which is only available from vast clinical studies. Therefore, human vaccine development is very expensive and time consuming. These factors are a large obstacle, resulting in a reduction in the vaccine research and development industry. However, for animals, these new technologies and various adjuvants have already been used. Before using new types of vaccines or their components for humans, it is very useful to use them for animals as a transition study.

Currently, the ferret is thought to be the most suitable animal model for respiratory influenza virus infection56 since ferrets are physiologically susceptible to wild type influenza viruses due to a similar respiratory tract and are able to transmit the virus once infected. As mentioned previously, ferrets display similar clinical disease as humans following influenza infection which include fever, weight loss, and sneezing and these positive features have been well discussed previously2124263056. As well, the ferret has been shown to have similar features as human in regard to IFN pathway function and is potential model for the study of human IFN-gamma signalling2457. Although the ferret is an appropriate model, it is imperative to be mindful of the disparities between animal models and the nature human infection to have an accurate assessment of research findings especially from ferret-influenza studies. During experimental influenza infections in animal models, a specific and known amount of virus is administered to the animal in a controlled manor, usually by intranasal inoculation. Modeling the infectious behaviour of a virus is more predictable when the infection route and dose are controlled. This is in contrast to natural infection where humans are infected with an unknown amount of virus in an unknown route, which must be considered when extrapolating results from animal model studies. Most significantly, ferrets as well as other animal models used in influenza studies are typically ‘Specific Pathogen Free' (SPF). In this case, the ferrets are determined to be influenza free prior to study initiation. Unlike humans who have been previously exposed to various subtypes of influenza viruses, ferrets used in influenza studies are completely naïve to the virus. The nuances of the immune response subsequent to multiple influenza infections, such as the phenomenon of original antigenic sin58, has only started to be elucidated in the ferret model53 and much work is still required to have a full understanding of the effect of sequential influenza infection on the specific immune response mounted. Furthermore, since the influenza virus is subject to both genetic shift and genetic drift35, the clinical manifestations of sequential virus infections by a virus that undergone multiple genetic drifts would differ from a response of a virus that had undergone a significant genetic shift as that of the H1N1 2009 pandemic variant.",20.929167460115877,11.324966306238617

Of course, these values vary depending on the prevalence of influenza in the community relative to other respiratory infections. In older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who have been vaccinated for influenza, only the presence of fever >37.8° and myalgias correlated with influenza, but with a lower positive predictive value of 41% (11). Other respiratory viruses, including but not limited to: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus or human metapneumovirus infection, may account for those with non-influenza infection. The use of influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is preferred to direct fluorescent antigen detection (DFA) due to its greater sensitivity. A nasopharyngeal swab is preferred for influenza PCR testing, particularly if the patient requires hospital admission. If the patient is intubated, an endotracheal aspirate can be substituted for an NP swab. If an NP swab has been performed and is negative, and the patient is subsequently intubated, an endotracheal aspirate specimen for PCR should also be performed.

During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2014–2016, thousands of people were infected and many of them died due to the viral infection [1]. EVD is generally considered as an endemic disease in Africa. However, its spread can be broadened through travel to all parts of the world. It is known to be transmitted from humans, bats, rodents, and chimpanzees to humans. Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family [2]. Ebola virus has a negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 different proteins and is surrounded by an envelope that contains the virally expressed glycoprotein (GP). There are five species of Ebola virus including, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, all of which were named after the places where they were first discovered [3]. Ebola virus GP is associated with viral attachment to the host cell receptor prior to viral entry into the cells [45]. To date, neutralizing antibodies targeting Ebola virus GP have been reported to be somewhat effective at reducing the severity of Ebola virus infection and disease progression in animal models and humans. For example, when Ebola virus-infected monkeys were treated within 24 hours following Ebola virus challenge with ZMAb (composed of three monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] against Ebola virus GP), all survived from Ebola virus infection, while all monkeys without ZMAb treatment died within five days of viral infection [67] Furthermore, ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) treatment is known to be effective at reducing mortality rates in patients infected with Ebola virus [8]. Despite the severity of Ebola virus infection, there are currently neither preventive vaccines nor therapeutic drugs readily available for use.

In rodents, for example, social isolation increases voluntary alcohol intake (42, 97, 98) as well as morphine consumption (99, 100) , and can alter DA release in response to alcohol intake (97) . A key predictor may be the duration (and possibly the developmental timing) of the isolation: short term acute isolation in adults may cause selective social motivation, whereas long-term or developmental isolation could lead to more general compensatory changes. Indeed, in our sample we find that participants who report higher levels of chronic loneliness show reduced activity in the SN/VTA in response to social cues, consistent with prior evidence(101) (but see (102) , (103)), but also to food cues, including on the baseline day. Thus, chronic loneliness might lead to broad alterations in the human motivation system, as in the animal models. However, the causal mechanism underlying these correlations remains unclear: individuals with reduced activity in motivational brain areas might be more prone to becoming lonely. This possibility highlights the importance of experimentally inducing acute isolation, to disentangle direct effects of isolation per se from individual differences in reward seeking behavior more generally.",14.111106156272305,5.773246692505394

However, human GWAS approaches have had limited success in identifying risk loci associated with certain forms of epilepsy (e.g. partial epilepsy) and specific seizure outcomes (e.g. SUDEP), partially due to complex disease etiologies and underpowered sample sizes 7, 8 . Animal studies remain essential for understanding the mechanisms of epilepsy and for identifying new therapeutic targets. In particular, animal models offer phenotypic repeatability and a means to study a trait in a controlled environment, as well as providing a level of experimental testing and validation that is not ethical or possible in human subjects, such as in the case of SUDEP. Most existing animal models of complex diseases such as epilepsy are limited because they do not mirror the genetic diversity found in the human population. In order to identify novel genetic targets, a model research population with a high level of genetic variation is needed.",19.88296709075382,10.58986825709724

Prevalence matters Authors: Affiliations: Main text,". Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69 -84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID-19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.",17.142090530701747,5.3280263742088225
