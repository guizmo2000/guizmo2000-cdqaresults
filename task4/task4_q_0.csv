In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",35.74038824942685,15.658851751957753

Severe respiratory illness is a significant symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection Volume 11, Number 2; 462-464, April 2020 because the ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in the lung alveolar type II cells and capillary endothelial cells. Besides, alveolar cells express TMPRSS2 [1, 7] . Infection of the lung by this virus leads to a cytokine storm with elevated levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, which causes edema, air exchange dysfunction, acute respiratory distress, secondary infection, which may result in death [1] . ACE2 expression is also seen in other tissues such as the heart, liver, kidney, and digestive organs. Such expression pattern explains why infected ICU patients are afflicted with not only acute respiratory distress syndrome but also other complications such as myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, shock, and death from multiple organ dysfunction syndromes [1, 8] .

However, its clinical efficacy and safety for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has not been evaluated. We noticed that this TCM product was not recommended by HNC's Guideline [89] . Same as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor ACE2 for the cellular entrance [8] . Theoretically, blockade of ACE2 can prevent the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Chen and Du thus performed the molecular docking study and they found that TCM-derived compounds, including as baicalin, scutellarin, hesperetin, glycyrrhizin and nicotianamine could interact with ACE2 [107].

The Hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the first drug repurposed with excellent results in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, but further, more extended studies, with a higher number of patients, are needed to confirm these results. Besides its limitations, repositioning clinical trials are still an attractive strategy: they may facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they may reduce the costs and time to reach the market; there is an existing pharmaceutical supply chain for formulation and distribution; and there is the possibility of combinations with other drugs in treatments that are more effective than monotherapy.

COVID-19 is a self-limiting disease in more than 80% of patients. Severe pneumonia occurred in about 15% of cases as revealed in studies with large cohorts of patients. The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon α2b, interferon β, chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon α2b and interferon β are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",30.505699310442644,13.424419539977404

Second, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in this family range from mild to moderate, with more systematic symptoms and more severe radiological abnormalities seen in older patients. Generally, COVID-19 appears to be less severe than SARS. Third, an asymptomatic child was found to have ground-glass opacities in his lung and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in his sputum sample.

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",44.12843488134221,17.600672293375396

A few clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of new vaccines in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Results of these studies in Phase-1 showed some degree of efficacy and one of these studies has been certified to begin Phase-2 (33, 34) . Absence of clinical symptoms, respiratory lesions in CT scan and two negative RT-PCR tests in two consecutive days are introduced as criteria of discharge from hospital or quarantine center in China (35) . However, recent studies reported several cases of COVID-19 with clinical manifestations of the disease along with a positive test after discharging from hospital (36, 37) . False positive and false negative results have been reported in RT-PCR test (10, 38) ; hence, hospitals in China have considered additional antibody test (negative IgM and positive IgG results) as a recovery criteria and discharge requirement (39) .

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",26.680628553540892,13.73702086749572

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers have been converted into 'Fang Cang' (temporary quarantine hospital facilities) for infected patients with mild symptoms [14] (Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for psychiatric hospitals in China to safely manage patients' major psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19. In addressing these challenges, future community mental health system reform is necessary to re-balance the system by re-distributing resources from hospital-centric services to community-based and primary care services.

Even though age is an important deterministic factor for severity of symptoms, other risk factors such as having a history of underlying diseases and/or co-infection with other infections like Influenza virus and Klebsiella may accelerate the progress of symptoms and lead to poor prognosis of the disease (26) .

In response, the National Health Commission of China [5] has established crisis psychological intervention teams across many Ivyspring International Publisher psychiatric hospitals in Hubei province and other parts of China [6] . This inevitably places increased pressure on the already inadequate mental health resources in China. For instance, the proportion of psychiatrists and doctors in psychiatric hospitals was 2.15 per 100,000 in 2016 [7] , which is considerably lower than that in most developed countries [8] . The mental health emergency response and deployment of expert teams from psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak may further deplete mental health services across psychiatric hospitals. In China, the public psychiatric hospitals are either run by the Ministry of Health, or by the public security and civil affairs systems. Apart from regular psychiatric services, psychiatric hospitals in the public security and civil affairs systems provide services in the areas of forensic psychiatry, substance dependence and psychiatric rehabilitation. Compared to those run by the Ministry of Health, these hospitals are usually located in suburban areas with poorer protective equipment and training for infectious diseases, which is associated with higher risk of the COVID-19 transmission. Some measures should be adopted to resolve these challenges. For example, outpatient visits need to be reduced in psychiatric hospitals, admission criteria should be tightened, and the length of hospitalization should be shortened [9] .",26.12489716631974,11.601072207569896

Furthermore, in the past decade, internship period in internal medicine has been reduced for medical students whose major is psychiatry in many medical schools in order to extend their training in mental health. All these factors could limit their clinical competence to control the potential transmission of COVID-19 in psychiatric hospitals. In addition, the lack of community-based mental health services has led to an over-reliance on psychiatric services provided by large psychiatric hospitals [10, 11] . For the vast majority of patients with serious mental illness, they can only access appropriate mental health care in hospital settings, which are mostly located in city areas. Therefore, they are more prone to exposure to infectious diseases such as the COVID-19, unless the psychiatric hospitals themselves implement stringent measures of infection control similar to general hospitals. Clearly, preventive measures such as the provision of adequate medical supplies and protective equipment, public education on the risks of COVID-19 for hospital staff and patients, and restricting family visits to hospitals, are essential to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission in major psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, all people including patients' families and health care workers need to be advised to wash hands regularly and maintain good personal hygiene. Measurement of body temperature should be performed at least once a day to closely monitor any suspected infectious symptoms.

Furthermore, the limited cancer patient population described in this first report from the literature, was curiously characterized by the lack of individuals receiving anticancer immunotherapy. Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [7] .

CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] .

Among such individuals, cancer patients represent a large subgroup at high risk of developing coronavirus infection and its severe complications. A recent nationwide analysis in China demonstrated that, of 1590 COVID-19 cases from 575 hospitals, 18 had a history of cancer (1 vs 0.29% of cancer incidence in the overall Chinese population, respectively), with lung cancer as the most frequent diagnosis [5] . Patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events compared with patients without cancer (39 vs 8%; p = 0.0003). Moreover, cancer patients who underwent recent chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of clinically severe events than did those not receiving treatment. With the limit of a small sample size, the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of COVID-19, and poorer outcomes, than individuals without cancer.

Despite clinical studies associating IL-6 with high disease severity in influenza-infected patients and its levels correlated directly with symptom occurrence in human influenza virus infection, the role of this cytokine is still ambiguous [24] . It was demonstrated in mice models that IL-6 is essential for preventing virus-induced neutrophil cell death and H1N1associated mortality, limiting influenza-induced cytokine storm and protecting against fatal lung pathology [25] . Furthermore, IL-6 is crucial in secondary infections to recall virus-specific memory CD4 T cells, favoring virus clearance and host survival, as supported by the inability of IL-6 deficient mice to control influenza viral titers in the lung [25] . Such preclinical evidence suggests that, despite probably being harmful in the ARDS phase, IL-6 role could be crucial, in the early phase of the viral infection, to defuse the pathogenesis of severe and lethal forms of influenza.

Most experienced staff should look after the patient, in order to minimize contamination to few personnel only.

It is recommended to form a good facemask seal with both hands, while making sure not to deliver any positive breaths (2) . Induction and relaxant medications should be administered at a maximum dose in order to prevent cough or gag reflex during the procedure (3). A video laryngoscope should be used so as to avoid having the operator position their face close to the patient. The most senior physician should at-tempt maintaining the airway, in order to maximally ensure first pass intubation success; however, in a failed airway scenario, attempts should be made to establish a surgical airway immediately. The endotracheal tube (ETT) should be positioned at a predetermined depth and secured properly. Avoid auscultation attempts to prevent instrument contamination, and look for bilateral chest rise or end tidal capnography waveform. If available, a viral filter should be connected to the adapter of the ETT, and another should be placed at the exhalation port of the ventilator (2) . A plastic transparent sheet can be placed over the patientâȂŹs head and chest to prevent droplet spread (4). All contaminated instruments should be placed in a transparent bag for immediate disposal and/or decontamination.

Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test. They can help in detection of COVID-19 patients.",39.89576199780334,17.455318390286468

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",37.63748194960176,14.829898341155017

Comparison of hematological parameters between mild and severe cases of COVID-19 showed significant differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6), D-Dimer, glucose (GLU), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIB) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (4). Fan et al. analyzed the hematological indices of COVID-19 infected patients between the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is formerly known as the '2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia', which was originated from a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in early December 2019 [1] . On the 7 th January, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified and isolated this novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between persons via close contacts [2] leading to COVID-19. Infected patients may develop severe and even fatal respiratory diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure) ending up in intensive care [2, 3] . Due to potentially serious health outcomes brought by COVID-19, from 23 rd January, 2020, Wuhan and other regions in China have adopted strict quarantine measures to prevent and control the disease epidemic [4, 5] . From 27 th January, 2020 onwards, all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in China have initiated an emergency response to major public health emergencies [4] . On Ivyspring International Publisher the 30 th January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global health emergency [6] . As of 18th February, 2020, the COVID-19 has caused 2,004 deaths out of the 74,185 confirmed cases [7] . Worryingly, on 17 th February, 2020 the China CDC Weekly [8] reported that a total of 3,019 Chinese health workers have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2, of which, six of them died [9, 10] including Dr. Wen-Liang Li, a 'whistleblower' who first declared the possible emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome pneumonia in China, and Dr. Zhi-Ming Liu, the President of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital in Hubei province.",28.37027429321158,14.302719398067016

Because no specific drugs have been shown with clear effectiveness in helping the human body to clear the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the disease severity rate in Shanghai (26 cases, around 9-10%) actually objectively reflected the natural history of the disease, and was comparable with the severity rate at other places outside Hubei Province. All critically ill patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, and six patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We found that in addition to the involvement of the respiratory system, critically ill patients often had systemic involvement of multiple organs, including the heart, kidney, and coagulation system in the early disease course. Sometimes multiple system involvement was observed even at the time of initial hospital admission.

Despite the Chinese authorities have announced relevant policies and actuating principles in a strategic manner, the COVID-19 outbreak has posted an emerging serious challenge for the mental health services in China. There are some limitations that need to be addressed. First, several online mental health services have been constructed across different areas, however, unified national management and coordination policies are still inadequate, which could result in uneven distribution and wastage of medical resources, let alone evaluating the efficacy of these services. Second, online mental health services are the predominant assistance measure and therefore, some people (e.g., older adults) who may have limited access to smartphones and the broadband internet, may benefit less from the services [42] . Third, frontline health professionals may have limited time and energy to access to these services due to heavy workload. Fourth, based on experiences of SARS outbreak, some patients and health professionals would be traumatized by the COVID-2019 outbreak and still suffer from persistent psychiatric symptoms even after the outbreak [43] .

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare. This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available. However, at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected, to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years, too. There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months. Some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in Italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels, and those above expected levels will then be attributed to COVID-19.",26.92161049934028,11.727318235954934

The new virus is thought to have originated from an animal-to-human spillover event linked to seafood and live-animal markets. The infection has spread locally in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated on Jan 23, 2020. More than 500 patients infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China have been reported between Jan 1 and Feb 14, 2020.

However, it was difficult to subsequently determine R0 parameter on the first 425 patients in Wuhan. The estimate of the R0 for COVID-19 in their article was 2.2, but with a very wide confidence interval -from 1.4 to 3.9. It is a bit of tough luck for the Italians, again, that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 1.4 exactly. This figure is well known to all epidemiologists, it' s the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community. It should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that, with more data, R0 for COVID-19 would start converging more towards 1.4. Unfortunately, the more recent data suggests that R0 is more likely to lean towards 3.9, implying an incredibly fast spread.

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) .

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",37.592049435748834,15.35668375749485

To date, more than 2,800 deaths and 87,000 confirmed positive cases have been reported around the world, making COVID-19 a major health concern. As a first line of treatment, along with the antiviral drugs, clinicians are using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the S1 domain of the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein [1] . Very recently (25 January 2020) the first and complete genome sequence of COVID-19 was deposited in the NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3) providing the key to the likely structure and glycosylation pattern of the viral proteins and consequent mode of interaction with the host cell. Similar to most other coronaviruses, the outer membrane spike glycoprotein, known for its glycosylation [3] , is the prime host interacting protein with host cell targets (such as ACE2, CD26, Ezrin, cyclophilins and other cell adhesion factors) important for cell adhesion and virulence [4, 5] . However, the specific host cell factors or proteins that facilitate the novel COVID-19 remain elusive. The current study was thus undertaken to predict the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein structure and glycan shield pattern that has great implications for understanding the viral camouflage and mode of cell entry, potentially assisting the development of new vaccines, antibodies, small-molecule drugs and screening of the human host targets.",30.105394802822246,14.475552164332818

This model was validated using the C-Score (confidence score) and TM score (structural similarity) ( Figure S2 ) demonstrating the most correct fold and confidence of the predicted structure. Further validation and refinement was completed by ensuring that the residues occupied Ramachandran favoured positions using Coot (www.mrcimb.cam.uk/) ( Figure S2 ).

Previous studies of CD26 binding have shown that residues K267, T288, A289, A291, L294, I295, R317, Y322 and D542 interact with Bat-CoV (MERS) spike protein [10] . Interestingly our docked model supports this despite the variability between these spike proteins' S1 domains, with the same CD26 residues in close proximity to the active region of S1 domain in COVID-19. We also observed additional residues (Q286, I287, N338, V341, R336) of CD26 predicted to interact with the S1 domain of the spike protein via van der Waals or by hydrogen bonding. However, regarding the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we noticed many different and unique residues (R408, Q409, T445, V417, L461, D467, S469, L491, N492, D493, Y 494, T497, T150, Y504) predicted to interact with CD26. Some of these unique residues of S1 domain are also predicted interact with the ACE2 protein [6] . This underlines the novelty and uniqueness of COVID-19 and its interaction with human target proteins. This observation guides us to suggest that COVID-19 may share infection modes with that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and that interactions with other targets also warrant investigation.",27.750385561043693,10.920720852870875

Assuming the current control measures were ineffective and insufficient, the estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without a peak. On the other hand, assuming the current control measures were effective and sufficient, the estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February 2020.",24.97121069980264,10.366883173122108

A Cochrane Review [33] found that Chinese herbs combined with western medicine significantly improved symptoms of SARS, including decreasing body temperature, cough and breathing difficulties, dosages of corticosteroids, improving absorption of pulmonary infiltration, and quality of life. A review [34] of 90 studies of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for SARS revealed positive but inconclusive results about the efficacy of combined treatment, using traditional Chinese herbal medicine as an adjuvant. Based on previous experience of treating SARS with traditional Chinese herbal medicine, the General Office of the National Health and Health Commission of China and the Office of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine encouraged the integration of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and western medicine. Different prescriptions are recommended in different stages of disease. This is the first systematic review to examine empirical evidence of the application of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19 pneumonia.

In light of the preliminary clinical data, CQ has been added to the list of trial drugs in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (sixth edition) published by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. CQ (N4-(7-Chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N1,N1-diethyl-1,4pentanediamine) has long been used to treat malaria and amebiasis. However, Plasmodium falciparum developed widespread resistance to it, and with the development of new antimalarials, it has become a choice for the prophylaxis of malaria. In addition, an overdose of CQ can cause acute poisoning and death 3 . In the past years, due to infrequent utilization of CQ in clinical practice, its production and market supply was greatly reduced, at least in China. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sulfate, a derivative of CQ, was first synthesized in 1946 by introducing a hydroxyl group into CQ and was demonstrated to be much less (~40%) toxic than CQ in animals 4 . More importantly, HCQ is still widely available to treat autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Since CQ and HCQ share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of acting as a weak base and immunomodulator, it is easy to conjure up the idea that HCQ may be a potent candidate to treat infection by SARS-CoV-2. Actually, as of February 23, 2020, seven clinical trial registries were found in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn) for using HCQ to treat COVID-19. Whether HCQ is as efficacious as CQ in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection still lacks the experimental evidence.",31.243820405392494,13.520412711040205

A specific reference was made to data from South Korea where 30% of the 2,000 tested patients reported symptoms or anosmia or ageusia. The article states that doctors are advising patients to self-isolate if they experience these symptoms as it could be an early indication of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. This is particularly pertinent since current governmental guidelines in the United Kingdom (UK) state that if you have either a temperature or a dry cough then to self-isolate. Should anosmia emerge as a symptom of COVID-19, this could encourage more people to self-isolate, even in absence of other symptoms, to prevent further spread of the virus. Therefore, more information surrounding this possible symptom is crucial. However, whilst it is possible that anosmia and ageusia are in fact symptoms of COVID-19, to our knowledge there is currently no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia and/or ageusia/dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, testing is not yet widespread in the UK and is mainly occurring only in patients hospitalised with the disease. It seems reasonable at this stage of the pandemic that new anosmia or ageusia in people who are otherwise well should be a trigger for testing where available. Otherwise, the onset of such symptoms could be considered as a criterion to self-isolate, particularly when occurring alongside other less common symptoms such as myalgia, diarrhoea or fatigue.",34.62670055098101,13.00452175014583

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",29.96536019288798,12.419690791717718

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.",26.980207756428747,11.016071834508667

COVID-19 gene bank (MT188341.1), COVID-19 (MT066175.1), bat-SL-CoVZC45 (MG772933.1), SARS-CoV BJ182b (EU371561.1) are identical alignment in 99%, 89%, and 82% respectively. In figure (1) shows the differences between 4 complete genomes shows as follow: Upon to the result above, we revealed that all COVID-19 strains are closest similarity compared to other strains related to the same family. In other words, we believe that COVID-19 came from several mutations happened to other members of coronavirus relates to the same infection. Although genomic analysis does not support the belief that COVID-19 is a laboratory construct, currently it is impossible to disprove or prove the theories of its origin. To identify the COVID-19 origin, obtaining virus sequences from immediate animal sources would be the most definite method. The first ORF (ORF1a/b) translates two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP) which takes two-thirds of viral RNA. The remaining ORFs encode structural proteins including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. COVID-19 also possesses accessory proteins that interfere with the host innate immune response [8] .",30.314835190696677,13.749614161226258

This may be a good clue for early diagnosis in the future. Case 2 developed a fever a few days after the CT findings, suggesting a delay in symptom development in these patients. During the earlier days of the outbreak, there had been limitations in both capacity and turnaround time for the nucleic acid test, which had further caused delay in confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 7 in many patients. It seems that the time for the early lung lesions or COVID-19 to become severe enough to cause clinical symptoms is rather long. Even among patients with fever, the typically used pharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test may be negative, owing to the absence of viruses in the upper respiratory tract despite the presence of pneumonia. However, radiographic changes can occur early (chest CT scan is mostly employed in the People's Republic of China during the current outbreak). Therefore, during an epidemic season, it is prudent to carefully evaluate any lung infiltration for GGO, and an appropriate serology test must be performed to rule out potential infection. 7 These two incidents also typify a common scenario during the earlier phase of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, during which a significant number of health care providers became infected in hospitals in Wuhan, and patients in a same room were cross-infected, as they were exposed to unknown transmission sources. Because of this, it is important to practice ""universal precaution"" in surgical pathology laboratories and regard all fresh specimens as potentially infectious.

Studies show clear person-to-person transmission. The average incubation period is 2-14 days, and mostly 3-7 days. However, in some patients, this period may be longer. Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID -19 where a 47year-old woman with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14-day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan. Almost at the same time, her father and sister were diagnosed with COVID-19. The results suggest that the long-term use of glucocorticoids might cause atypical infections, a long incubation period, and extra transmission of COVID-19.",27.606359351395106,13.15437653864571

The face masks can be divided into N95 respirators and surgical masks, and both have different uses. The N95 respirator is designed with filtration requirements to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and minimize leakage from the facial seal. 14 As such, it protects the wearer from the inhalation of viral particles. Surgical masks are often fitted loosely but can prevent respiratory droplet transmission and prevent hand-to-face contact. They are considered to be more effective in preventing spread from an infected person wearing the mask to another than in protecting the wearer from infection. In a randomized clinical trial, the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks were found to have comparable outcomes in protection from influenza virus in outpatient settings 14 ; however, N95 respirators are the preferred option when dealing with PUIs or COVID-19 patients.",34.64928293385767,12.29548271036925

Several abnormalities also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection. 16 In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation have been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3",33.44986920450102,15.1551610878397

Radiotherapy is delivered to nearly 50% of cancer patients, a particularly vulnerable group given their older age, frequent comorbidities, and underlying cancer diagnosis. 2 Prostate cancer is frequently treated with radiation and the most common solid tumor in men; it is a heterogeneous disease where timely therapy is indicated for some cases, and where watchful waiting, active surveillance, or deferral of treatment could be acceptable for others. 3, 4 Given the current epidemic crisis, delaying radiotherapy treatment (which requires multiple visits to healthcare facilities) for prostate cancer patients may potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic exposure to COVID-19. At the healthcare system level, when clinically appropriate, reducing visits conserves limited hospital resources (e.g. personal protective equipment (PPE)) for use by health-care workers who will have to care for the potentially vast number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The decision to delay life-saving cancer treatment in a time of a resource-intensive pandemic represents a clinical conundrum without modern precedent. In these exigent circumstances, guidelines as to how to manage patients who present with prostate cancer would be valuable for the practicing clinician.

Rapid discharge of patients with primary NSTEMI following revascularization will likely be important in terms of maximizing bed availability and reducing patient exposure within the hospital. Follow-up through telehealth venues could be satisfactory in most cases. It has been suggested that in appropriately selected cases of patients with known COVID-19 and NSTEMI, (e.g., particularly for patients with type 2 MI) conservative therapy may be sufficient based on the patient's risk. It is important to note that recent reports suggest that acute cardiac injury is present in ~7% of patients with COVID-19 and may represent either type 2 MI or myocarditis (3) . All of these factors need to be taken into account when weighing risks and benefits vis-à-vis infection control.

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members.

At present, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccine against COVID-19 infection for potential therapy of humans. The only option available is using broad-spectrum antiviral drugs like Nucleoside analogues and also HIV-protease inhibitors that could attenuate virus infection until the specific antiviral becomes available [7] . The treatment that have so far been attempted showed that 75 patients were administrated existing antiviral drugs. The course of treatment included twice a day oral administration of 75 mg oseltamivir, 500 mg lopinavir, 500 mg ritonavir and the intravenous administration of 0·25 g ganciclovir for 3-14 days [26] .

It is clear however, that more research is urgently needed to identify novel chemotherapeutic drugs for treating COVID-19 infections.

Many coronaviruses infect humans and other mammalian hosts. Coronavirus can be divided into four genera (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans. 2 Human coronavirus infections are typically mild and rarely associated with severe diseases. However, the epidemics of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused alarming morbidity and mortality. 3 While coronaviruses are often zoonotic, person-to-person transmission has been confirmed for SARS-CoV-2, similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. 4 As of March 5, 2020, there are more than 95 333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and at least 3282 reported deaths, indicating that it is a severe public health threat. 5 There is no clinically approved antiviral for coronavirus therapy. 6 Although remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug candidate by Gilead currently advanced into human clinical trials to treat COVID-19 in both China and the U.S., was reported to improve patient outcomes in a recent study, 7 it is still critical and urgent to search for other effective inhibitors for the potential treatment of COVID-19.",31.037578655860393,11.063835944487202

The WHO declared the epidemic of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 12 th 2020 [3] . According to a recent Chinese stud, about 80% of patients present with mild disease and the overall case-fatality rate is about 2.3% but reaches 8.0% in patients aged 70 to 79 years and 14.8% in those aged >80 years [4] . However, there is probably an important number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus the mortality rate is probably overestimated. France is now facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 4500 cases, as of March 14 th 2020 [5] . Thus, there is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage in order to limit the transmission in the community.

Remdesivir is being developed by Gilead as a monophosphoramidate prodrug: GS-441524. It was intended to be an intravenous treatment for Ebola but it also shows potential against coronavirus and Nipah virus infection. The results from evaluating the antiviral efficiency of remdesivir against a clinical isolate of COVID-19 in vitro suggest that it could inhibit COVID-19 strongly with an EC50 ranging from 0.77 to 1.76 μM [3] . Remdesivir cured the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the USA, which prompted Gilead and the Chinese authorities to move the Phase III trial ahead and expand it to a lot more patients who desperately need treatment. Final results of the clinical trial will be announced in April 2020. In contrast to remdesivir, the activity report of favipiravir in vitro and in vivo is limited. However, there are still three active clinical trials regarding favipiravir that have begun enrolling patients in China. Lopinavir and ritonavir, targeting 3Clpro, were used to treat SARS patients from China in 2003. Shortly after the emergence of MERS-CoV, researchers identified lopinavir and ritonavir as MERS-CoV inhibitors. The national expert group has recommended lopinavir and ritonavir as effective anti-COVID-19 agents in China, and most clinical trials on COVID-19 select both drugs as positive controls. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Currently, only one trial combines emtricitabine/tenofoviralafenamide and lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19 patients. Arbidol as a 2′-5′oligoadenylates synthesis (OAS) inhibitor against severe pneumonia and virusassociated cytokine dysregulation has displayed anti-COVID-19 potential in clinical trials [4] . However, the mechanism needs to be clarified in the near future. Chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have elicited antiviral effects on several viruses such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E by interfering with endosomal acidification. Based on the advantage of known broadspectrum activity and rarely occurring adverse reactions, a series of clinical trials on chloroquine and its derivatives have been advancing rapidly. Presently, Chinese government authorities have approved chloroquine phosphate to be used to treat adult patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Further, treatments combining Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and chemical molecules (popularly known as Western medicine in China) have shown some exciting results. In view of inconclusive clinical evidence on TCM efficacy, pharmacologists should separate active pharmaceutical ingredients and identify explicit targets as soon as possible [5] . Surprisingly, various drugs are also in clinical trials despite the lack of biological rationale, such as the antiinfluenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir targeting neuraminidase, baloxavirmarboxil targeting cap-dependent endonuclease that is not found in COVID-19, ASC09 targeting protease with no anti-coronavirus research reported, and cobicistat targeting CYP3A4 with only unpersuasive predicted activity by computer virtual docking. As the crystal structures of COVID-19 spike [6] , dimeric full-length human ACE2 [7] and COVID-19 spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ACE2 receptor [8] are published in succession, the lead drug discovery strategy such as structure-based HTS and molecular dynamics simulation to discover inhibitors with affinity to ACE2, the S protein or the protein-protein interaction will be possible in the near future. There have been three major outbreaks of coronaviruses in the 21st century: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19. Drawing experience from effective screening strategies on antitumor drug development, the credible and large-scale screening system of the especially deadly coronaviruses must be set up at the molecular level and in animal models as soon as possible. Although the clinical safety of old drugs has been proven, some of them can cause serious adverse reactions. For example, hydroxychloroquine has the side effect of arrhythmia, which can itself lead to death.

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement. Also, a staging system based on the severity and organ involvement is needed in COVID-19 in order to rank the patients for aggressive or conventional treatment modalities.

Most of the evidence of ACE2 expression in the brain ( Figure 1 ) comes from literature and mammalian tissue expression databases, 2 which prompted us to investigate neurotropic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its contribution toward the morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. 3.1. Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Recently, a study posted in medRxiv 4 has reported neurological manifestations in COVID-19 in the current outbreak that involved 214 patients, of which 78 (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations, which affirms our rationale of the neurotropic potential in the COVID-19 virus. Also, a finding published on a patient who had loss of involuntary control over breathing 5 during the recent outbreak with several other patients suffering acute respiratory failure implores healthcare professionals and clinicians to segregate COVID-19 patients into neurologically affected cases and those who are devoid of neurological deficits.",33.34566840537986,13.47711011323343

Nevertheless, based on the assumption that viral RNA load correlates with high levels of viral replication, 5 there are important insights to be gained from this time-course analysis. Currently, our understanding of the relationship between viral RNA load kinetics and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 remains fragmented. Zou and colleagues reported that patients with COVID-19 with more severe disease requiring intensive care unit admission had high viral RNA loads at 10 days and beyond, after symptom onset. 4 Unfortunately, it is unknown when in the course of their disease these patients deteriorated. By contrast, Lescure and colleagues report the viral RNA kinetics of two patients who developed late respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. It would be interesting to know whether viral RNA load in lung tissue, or a surrogate sample such as tracheal aspirate, mirrors the decline in nasopharyngeal shedding. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that these late, severe manifestations might be immunologically mediated and has obvious implications for the potential to use immune-modulatory therapies for this subset of patients. This finding is consistent with recent reports that corticosteroids were beneficial for acute respiratory distress syndrome, 6 and possibly those with COVID-19. 7 With more detailed data such as those provided by Lescure and colleagues, the use of viral RNA load to suggest potential clinical strategies to treat COVID-19 could be exploited.",30.70791419497982,13.878825955124192

In order to reduce the risk of exposure to SRAS-CoV-2 infections, elective surgery should be postponed as much as possible (for example no recent episodes of gallstone disease, kidney stones, uterine fibroids, cataracts, knee and hip replacement surgery, etc.). 1.2 Establish a full-time intubation team. Generally, there should be 2 to 3 groups of fixed personnel to perform tracheal intubation for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. It is recommended to rotate between groups at regular intervals (usually 14 days of quarantine) to avoid excessive fatigue of medical staff and reduce risk of infection. 1.2.1 Endotracheal intubation in emergency and limited-surgery patients (usually progressive malignancies) Preparation of operating room: Anesthesia and surgery for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be performed in an isolated negative pressure operating room as far as possible. Patients and medical staff must enter the operating room after the negative pressure system is activated. If there is no negative pressure operating room, you must choose an operating room with special access channels and relatively independent spatial locations. Avoid the central air conditioning and ventilation system during the operation, turn off the purification system during the operation, and perform complete disinfection after the operation. 1.2.2 Preparation of patients and anesthesiologist: Patients enter the operating room to wear medical surgical masks, then remove the patient masks before the intubation until all things are ready，and try yours best to reduce the direct exposure of the patient's respiratory tract to the operating room.

For example, nonpharmacological treatments such as re-positioning in bed or the use of handheld fans may help relieve symptoms, although use of the latter in inpatient settings may be limited due to risk of aerosolizing viral particles. Pharmacological treatments such as judicious use of opioids and benzodiazepines for dyspnea and anxiety, respectively, could be used carefully for patients with respiratory failure. COVID-19 patients may also experience gastrointestinal, olfactory and hypogeusia/ageusia symptoms for which providers should assess and provide symptom-targeted relief (in the case of gastrointestinal symptoms) or acknowledgement (for changes in smell and taste).

Individuals at high risk for severe COVID-19 are typically of older age and/or present with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, a similar profile to those at increased risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, making them more susceptible to liver injury. In patients with COVID-19 with autoimmune hepatitis, the effects of administration of glucocorticoids on disease prognosis is unclear. Given the expression of the ACE2 receptor in cholangiocytes, whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 aggravates cholestasis in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, needs to be studied [22] .",28.569134493295476,13.18284748282874

Patients with COVID-19 and cancer had a higher risk of severe events [53] . Likewise, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using biologics and immunosuppressive agents are at increased risk for more frequent and severe infections and could be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [48] . Fortunately, with early precautions for COVID-19 prevention and control, not a single patient of the 318 patients (204 with ulcerative colitis and 114 with Crohn's disease) in the IBD registry in Wuhan, has been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 [54] . These precautions included recommendations on the use of immunosuppressive agents and biologics, diet, and intentional postponement of elective surgery and endoscopy, as well as personal protection provisions [55] .

However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14] . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides [15] . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients [16] . 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes [17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 [18, 19] . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence [20] . Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.",40.42594199131941,15.219980718323145

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases. [7] [8] [9] More recent descriptions of patients in China also noted around 10% of patients were also noted to have elevated total bilirubin levels. 8 Gastroenterologists should be aware of these potential gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.",35.29563536140526,15.0613739317916

General measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection will be of utmost importance for these patients. Depending on the local infrastructure, implementation of COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals is warranted. However, based on the local COVID-19-burden, a sharp separation of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" wards/hospitals may not be sustainable, although recent evidence provides somewhat reassuring data regarding the absence of environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA of inanimate surfaces outside patient rooms. 20 Wherever possible, patients with chronic liver disease requiring inpatient care for non-COVID-19 causes should be admitted to COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals. As these institutions may not be able to provide specialised hepatology-care, similar to our recommendations on outpatient care, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information to facilitate immediate hepatology consultations. However, due to the contagiousness of the virus, patients with underlying liver disease will become infected and will subsequently require inpatient care for COVID-19. With regards to nosocomial-infections, recent observations from Spain that compared patient characteristics between patients with community-acquired influenza and nosocomial-acquired influenza could not detect a significant difference between these cohorts with regards to underlying chronic liver disease. 21 Whether these observations will also hold up in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be proven. Until further evidence emerges, we recommend that patients with chronic liver disease and COVID-19 are admitted for inpatient care if they have additional risk factors for a more severe COVID-19 course like hypertension, diabetes or obesity, cirrhosis, HCC or a posttransplant status.",31.900851359021214,14.244512238619766

Although ritonavir-boosted lopinavir showed some antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, a recently published clinical trial in patients with severe COVID-19 showed no effect in vivo compared to no treatment. 28 Other drugs currently under evaluation include chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine. 29 Chloroquine has shown antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro through interference with the ACE2-receptor mediated endocytosis and is widely used in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 as monotherapy, but also in combination with azithromycin. 24, [30] [31] [32] The administration of any of these compounds to infected patients will remain an individual decision as efficacy and optimal timing remain to be clarified. However, with regards to patients with chronic liver disease, possible adverse events have to be kept in mind. This is particularly important with respect to drug-interactions in patients with certain immunosuppressive therapies where drug levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus or everolimus will have to be closely monitored. In addition, patients with impaired liver function are at high risk of drug toxicities, i.e. in patients with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis. Table 1 summarises some considerations with regards to potential toxicities in these patients. It is also important to stress that all the drugs currently under investigation are not approved for SARS-CoV-2. However, given that early initiation of antiviral therapy is known to blunt the course of influenza, it is reasonable to assume that early treatment initiation might also be beneficial to prevent severe pneumonia in COVID-19. Thus, in patients with liver disease and risk factors for a severe course of the disease, we recommend inclusion into early antiviral treatment programmes or clinical trials that might be active at different centres.",32.91698703521675,13.76509842548733

As demonstrated in this report, the development of mild COVID-19 illness was insidiously initiated and persisted for a long period. The prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 detection in naso-oropharyngeal specimens of the COVID-19 patients with mild illness is of concern in epidemic areas. Clinical manifestations of viral respiratory infections range from asymptomatic or flu-like symptoms such as fever, nonproductive or productive cough, myalgia, rhinorrhea, and sore throat, to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organs failure. 10 Various viral pathogens cause community-acquired infections during the cold season in Taiwan. Of which, influenza A/B, human Metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common. 11 The lack of specificity for clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and chest 13, 14 is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic or presented flu-like symptoms. 15, 16 Under this circumstances, quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients and the application of rapid detection tools for etiology confirmation is strongly recommended.

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",31.192428646557644,11.585463278815736

The in vivo study conducted in common marmosets (non-human primate model) showed that animals treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-1β had better outcomes than untreated animals. 74 The combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-1β is being evaluated for MERS in the MIRACLE trial. 75 The same two protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, when combined with ribavirin, were found to be associated with favorable clinical responses in SARS patients indicating therapeutic efficacy. 10 As an early attempt to evaluate these repurposed drugs in COVID-19, a controlled trial of ritonavirboosted lopinavir and interferon-α 2b therapy has been registered for hospitalized patients in China (ChiCTR2000029308). 76 Oral administration of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir has been used as an empirical drug for COVID-19 suspected cases in China hospitals even though there is no evidence of its efficacy. 2 Recently, the in vitro antiviral efficacy of approved drugs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, and chloroquine was compared with that of the two broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir and favipiravir for COVID-19. Among the evaluated drugs, both remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling COVID-19 in vitro. 63 The study also pointed out that the three nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, and favipiravir may not have significant in vivo antiviral effects against COVID-19 since higher concentrations were required to reduce the viral infection in vitro. Both remdesivir and chloroquine are being used for the treatment of other diseases and have a well-defined safety profile. Hence, such drugs can be used for evaluating their efficacy in patients of novel CoV infections.",35.491404315497206,14.588492537769678

[68] [69] [70] Therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for COVID-19 include molecules binding to the virus, molecules, or inhibitors that target specific enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription, small-molecule inhibitors targeting helicase, essential proteases, or other proteins of the virus, host cell protease inhibitors, host cell endocytosis inhibitors, siRNA, anti-sense RNA and ribozyme, neutralizing antibodies, mAbs targeting host receptor or interfere with S1 RBD, antiviral peptide targeting S2, and natural products. 2, 11 There is a long list of anti-CoV agents, mostly preclinical compounds yet to be evaluated as anti-COVID-19 agents. Some of these agents are in phase III trials for COVID-19, including remdesivir, oseltamivir, ASC09F (HIV protease inhibitor), lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and cobicistat. 71 Many existing MERS-and/or SARS-CoVs inhibitors can be screened for efficacy. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has shown 96% identity to that of SARS-CoV, a critical finding since drugs developed for SARS-CoV RdRp might show similar efficacy for SARS-CoV -2 RdRp. 28 S protein is considered the major target for designing CoV antiviral therapies such as S protein inhibitors, S cleavage inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, RBD-ACE2 blockers, siRNAs, fusion core blockers, and protease inhibitors. 19 All such therapeutic strategies have shown potential in vitro and/ or in vivo anti-CoV activities. Comparatively, even though in vitro studies performed with these agents have shown efficacy, most of them lack sufficient support due to the lack of randomized animal or human trials, hence of limited use for COVID-19. Hence, the necessary support of extensive animal and human trials is required for such therapeutics to become useful. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 affects the balance of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), potentially leading to exacerbation of severe pneumonia. Thus, it is speculated that ACEI and angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) inhibitors might be able to reduce pulmonary inflammatory responses, thereby reducing the mortality. 72 The guidance to COVID-19 control might be based on existing measures for MERS and SARS, with some further precautions due to the unknown nature of this new CoV. 14, 73 The main treatments such as mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe cases. Furthermore, RNA synthesis inhibitors (like 3TC, TDF), remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, Chinese traditional medicine, such as Lianhuaqingwen and ShuFengJieDu Capsules, could be the promising COVID-19 treatments. 2 However, further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for COVID-19. A major limiting factor in the quest for identifying an ideal vaccine or therapeutic agent is time. It may take months to even several years for researchers to develop, produce, standardize, evaluate, approve, and commercialize therapeutic agents for COVID-19. Hence, current efforts should be directed toward identifying and evaluating drugs and immunotherapeutics that have proven efficacy against viruses similar to COVID-19.",30.951232488936817,13.487155868207736

As tocilizumab and baricitinib may start to be used to treat CoViD-19 severe pneumonia cases, their availability must be guaranteed for the treatment of rheumatic patients who are using these compounds. If a rheumatic patient develops symptoms of any infection, it is important to follow the guidelines suggested by the rheumatology community and immunosuppressive therapy should be paused for the duration of the infection. The one exception is hydroxychloroquine, which may have therapeutic potential for CoViD-19 infection and should therefore not be stopped in patients who have been taking it for a rheumatic disease. As mentioned above, it is possible that IL-6 blockade and the use of JAK inhibitors could have beneficial effects on severe lung disease, but we don't yet know enough to recommend continuing these agents, since they could adversely affect viral clearance. Much more study of the kinetics of SARS-CoV2 in the lung, and the relation of the immune response to the onset of CRS, is therefore needed to clarify recommendations for patients on these agents. The epidemiological scenario is rapidly changing daily and we still have no knowledge about the infection rate and course of CoViD-19 in rheumatologic conditions. Therefore, a national or international registry is strongly encouraged to understand the impact of the infection on specific rheumatic diseases or treatments and the risk factors for poor outcomes. The Italian Society of Rheumatology has established such a registry in March 2020 and data are being collected.

Anti-rheumatic drugs as possible therapies: antimalarials, anti-IL6, anti-IL1 and baricitinib Some drugs usually used in rheumatologic field and targeting the host and its immune response seem to have the potential to interfere with CoViD-19 infection and their potential benefit is being studied in patients (Fig. 1) . The pathogenesis of CoViD-19 remains unclear, but modelling assays revealed a high degree of homology in the receptor binding domains between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. All coronaviruses express a surface glycoprotein termed a ""spike"" which bind to the host receptor for viral entry that has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2r) [1] , expressed by mature lung epithelial cells, enterocytes, kidney proximal tubular cells and endothelial cells [6] . After receptor binding, lysosomal proteases cleave the spike protein releasing the signal peptide that facilitates viral entry into the cell [7] . These mechanisms may be targeted and interrupted by therapies such as chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and preliminary data demonstrate that it may have clinical benefit in the management of CoViD-19 infected patients as determined by improved imaging and shortening of the diseases course [8] . We should note that hydroxychloroquine, which shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine but has a better safety profile and is frequently used particularly in connective tissue disease, has a more potent anti-viral effect than chloroquine in vitro. From the results of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models, a loading dose of 800 mg orally followed by 400 mg daily for four days reaches three times the potency of chloroquine and is therefore a promising drug for both the prevention and the treatment of CoViD-19, with low risk of toxicity [9] . These findings have led to several clinical trials that are ongoing to study the efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in CoViD-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine is thus being used in Italy for the treatment of CoViD-19 patients despite the absence of efficacy data in the clinical setting. In light of these data, the recommendation for rheumatic patients chronically taking antimalarial drugs is to not discontinue them, considering the antiviral efficacy and the immunomodulatory rather than immunosuppressive effect.",34.74366177520562,14.276016043528845

There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] .

By March 10, 2020, 116 166 cases have been reported globally, causing 4088 deaths. The epidemic has spread to 118 countries around the world. 2 With immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy, pregnant women could be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading, maternal management and fetal safety become a major concern, but there is scarce information of assessment and management of pregnant women infected with COVID-19, and the potential risk of vertical transmission is unclear. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Nan Yu and colleagues 3 report the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancy with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Seven pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were assessed and the onset symptoms were similar to those reported in non-pregnant adults with COVID-19. All patients received oxygen therapy and antiviral treatment in isolation. All patients had caesarean section after consultation with a multidisciplinary team and the outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and one was found to be infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth.

As of 25 February 2020, at least 77 785 cases and 2666 deaths had been identified across China [5] and in other countries; in particular, 977 and 861 cases were identified in South Korea and Japan, respectively. The outbreak has already caused global alarm. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a genome sequence that is 75%-80% identical to that of SARS-CoV, and has more similarities to several bat coronaviruses [6] . SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh reported human-infecting member of the family Coronaviridae, which also includes SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. It has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. Both the clinical and the epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and high mortality. About 16%-21% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill, with a 2%-3% mortality rate [1, 4] . However, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to identify effective antiviral agents to combat the disease and explore the clinical effect of antiviral drugs.",31.77644517418175,13.08145683048914

According to a survey of 2216 GI doctors from all over China early in the outbreak of COVID-19, the awareness of digestive system damage and involvement in COVID-19 was low, ranging from 31% to 35% [3] . To counteract this, the CSG rapidly organized a group of experts including gastroenterologists working in the forefront of COVID-19 patient care to discuss and reach a consensus on management of digestive disorders involved in COVID-19 (Table 1 ) [4] .This consensus includes recommendations regarding transmission route, clinical manifestation spectrum of digestive system involvement, practical guidelines on treatment based on the latest publications, and precautions regarding endoscopic procedure. In addition, cautions for GI outpatient clinic have been proposed [4] . The CSG is comprised of 25 committees of sub-specialty depending on the disease spectrum. As a response to the increasing concern and inquiry about COVID-19 risk from the community of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in China, the Chinese IBD Committee affiliated to CSG has issued timely recommendations for managing IBD patients in early February 2020, which is probably the first guideline regarding IBD and COVID-19 in the global community [5] . The guideline includes practical recommendations regarding immunosuppressive agent and biologics use, diet, Epidemics and public health crises pose great challenges to health care delivery. To minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by avoiding close contact with infected patients in public areas such as hospitals, telemedicine has also been widely applied in our non-COVID-19 patient care including virtual clinic visits online clinic consultancy and nurse-led care support based on interactive social care app such as WeChat.

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",28.737128887850766,12.25533038973565

First, for patients admitted to the ICU, death might occur despite full intensive care support, including mechanical ventilation, ECMO, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. On modern ICUs, such deaths are expected to be infrequent; however, robust estimates of the number of deaths cannot be made from the mostly descriptive reports currently available. A second possible scenario for ICU and hospital patients is related to limitation of life-sustaining therapies because of poor predicted outcomes associated with old age, frailty, comorbidities, or profound disability, or because of effects of distributive limitations associated with lack of personnel, beds, or materials. A combination of these two factors often exists. A third scenario relates to patients admitted to the ICU or hospital whose deaths are not directly related to COVID-19. Especially in areas with high infection rates, patients might be admitted to the ICU with, for example, severe trauma or acute brain injury, test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the ICU stay, and eventually die because of the initial injury; these deaths will still be attributed to COVID-19 and included in the statistics. Similarly, some patients might have SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the actual contribution of the virus to the patient's death might be minimal. For example, in a patient with metastatic cancer or terminal organ failure, is the viral infection or the patient's underlying condition the cause of death? The actual role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in such deaths is particularly difficult to evaluate in countries where only one cause can be reported on a death certificate.",30.59922782575096,13.993003483595965

It is mandatory, especially in a finite resource system, to balance the potential benefit of containment measures, such as postponing scheduled procedures, with negative health and social costs. Diverting the attention exclusively to the COVID-19 situation and overshadowing the everyday clinical practice may have substantial negative implications, especially for cancer patients. Re-allocating an excessive amount of health care personnel, both nurses and doctors, to the COVID-19 triage and management may stretch an already fragile system and potentially leave uncovered some vital activities, such as treatment administration, surgeries and inpatient assistance. It is well established that delayed oncologic surgery may lead to disease progressions and result in tumors no longer resectable, leading to worse survival outcomes. The same goes for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens administered with suboptimal timing. It should be emphasized that we are talking about patients potentially cured by oncologic treatments. Therefore, any delay of these fundamental procedures, either intentional or due to shortage of personnel, should be avoided. The same risk is present for the people who have scheduled screening activities (e.g. screening mammography for the early diagnosis of breast cancer). People should be advised to maintain their scheduled appointments, if the procedure is feasible safely, or at least to promptly reschedule their appointment when the epidemic is expected to slow its pace. For patients with advanced disease, as oncologists we know the enormous negative impact from disease progression in terms of both survival time and quality of life. The inability to deliver palliative care to patients unable to move from their homes and the management of treatment side-effects are other significant concerns from a forced quarantine. 5 Patients with advanced disease, and no suggestive symptoms of COVID-19, should keep receiving planned chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment, without unnecessary delays. Moreover, although postponing follow-up and cancer prevention appointments is a strategy to be considered, an excessive accumulation of visits or examinations risks burdening the national public health system over the next few months.",27.659895861008884,11.464562981675757

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

There was no evidence of new onset atrioventricular block in COVID-19 patients and no arrhythmic cardiac death during hospitalization. Nevertheless, a previous report in 138 COVID-19 patients showed that common complications included arrhythmias in 16.7% of cases and acute cardiac injury in 7.2% [2] . This was confirmed in another recent report in 187 patients with COVID-19 demonstrating malignant arrhythmias in 11.5% of patients with increased troponin [4] . In this study the upper reference limit of troponin I was 0.12 ng/mL. The same authors demonstrate that even if functional and morphological cardiac abnormalities were infrequent with increased troponin levels had a significant hazard ratio of 8.9 (95% confidence interval 1.9-40.6) for the risk of death, as reported by others [4, 5] . Of note, in accordance with a similar report, troponin I was not elevated at the beginning of the infection while in patients with severe clinical conditions tended to increase [10] . This finding suggests that troponin I is mainly a marker of multiorgan failure and pulmonary hypertension associated with ARDS more than a marker that identifies patients with acute myocarditis. Finally, the Authors conclude that elevation of troponin during hospitalization is an important marker of prognosis and should be seen as a warning sign even if not generally increased at the beginning of hospitalization. The observation that troponin levels at the beginning of hospitalization cannot differentiate between survivors and non-survivors is also in line with a previous publication [10] . The study by Deng et al. [9] does not support to perform routine echocardiogram in all patients with COVID-19, but it should be considered in those with raised troponin. Several reports suggest that increased troponin levels in the emergency department could identify patients at higher risk for acute myocarditis triggered by SARS-CoV-2 [7, 8] . Identification of these patients would be important clinically since they often present with atypical symptoms such as chest pain and minimal respiratory involvement [7, 8] .

It is a hydroxylated version of chloroquine -an antimalarial that has been in use for decades, with a similar mechanism of action. HCQ is considered to be safer than chloroquine based on clinical studies (3,4). This drug has now found place in management of COVID-19 infection (3 -10).

Unfortunately, multiple studies have shown that patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension and coronary artery disease, are more likely to suffer from a severe COVID-19 infection that requires ICU care, have complications like ARDS, which in turn may result in death [27] [28] [29] 32, 40] . One study showed that patients infected with COVID-19 who had underlying hypertension had increased odds of death (OR 3.05 [95% CI 1.57-5.92, p b .001]) compared to those without hypertension. Similarly, coronary artery disease was associated with increased odds (OR 21.4 [95% CI 4.64-98.7, p b .0001]) of death [40] . In one meta-analysis, COVID-19 patients with hypertension had a relative risk ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.54-2.68, p b .00001) of having severe disease/ requiring ICU care compared to those without hypertension.

When analyzing the largest case series to date (44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases), the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that patients with cardiovascular disease had a case fatality rate of 10.5% and those with hypertension had a case fatality rate of 6%, both of which were higher than the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% [39] (Fig. 2) . Patients with hypertension accounted for 13% of the COVID-19 cases but they comprised 32% of the COVID-19 deaths. Patients with cardiovascular disease made up 4.2% of the COVID-19 cases, but were responsible for 18.3% of the COVID-19 deaths ( [42] , Fig. 2 ). This may be due to the fact that patients with history of coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes may have reduced or impaired cardiovascular functional reserve, and the COVID-19 infection may either precipitate a myocardial infarction (type 1 myocardial infarction), increase myocardial demand leading to worsening ischemia and necrosis (type 2 myocardial infarction), or increase metabolic demand that leads to heart failure and death [43] .",35.088700796222774,13.982687881360084

There has always been overwhelming public support for Medicare negotiation, and this is something we must do now more than ever because it can help keep prices lower. 15 As a last resort, the federal government should be willing to issue compulsory licensing, if negotiations with companies fail to reach agreement on a reasonable price. 16 2001, allows governments to license the use of a patented invention to a third party or government agency without the consent of the patent-holder if negotiations with the patent owner are unsuccessful. 17 Another major factor that can increase the prices of COVID-19 related drugs in the United States are pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who normally act as middlemen between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and insurers. PBMs are supposed to deliver value to insurers and the insured public by identifying the best options for formulary placement and negotiating for lower prices. However, this is not always the case. PBMs may favor expensive drugs over inexpensive alternatives, and best illustrated by insulin prices that steadily contribute to increases in the list prices of even older insulin preparations. 13 The resulting higher retail prices disproportionately affect the uninsured and under-insured public.

They follow the regulations of local and national government, and provide prescription medications dispensing service and other pharmacy-related services. Retail pharmacies in China provide some prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, supplements, and health-related products and devices for sale. They are not considered part of the healthcare system as they practice follow different companies' regulations. The professional skills of pharmacy staff and pharmacists work in these retail pharmacies varies significantly, and are generally not considered as healthcare professionals. 4 Special needs of PC services during the COVID-19 pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need of PC services is beyond the scope of traditional practice of community pharmacists, which can be divided into two parts: the need of pandemic prevention and control and the need from patients of pharmacy-related issues. To promote the pandemic control, community patients need to be screened properly and suspected patients shall be referred to designated medical institutions in a timely manner. 5 The public also need to master effective personal protection skills to control the community transmission of COVID-19. 2,6,7 Patients on medical isolated observation or patients with mild COVID-19 on treatment at home are lacking guidance on home care strategies. 8 The pharmacy-related needs of community patients have similarities with the traditional patient population, but with different emphasis. For example, when providing consulting services to community patients, instead of focusing on medications as usual, their questions are mainly on the scientific prevention knowledge and basic information about COVID-19, such as mask selection and typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19. For chronic disease patients, especially those in communities under quarantine, drug supply and patients' compliance are facing a greater challenge, though the safety and effectiveness of treatment is also important for this patient population. Thus, community pharmacists shall learn to switch gears when needed from providing professional knowledge on medication use only to fulfilling community patients' various needs.",34.65884962786721,13.220359383904142

We found that patients with AKI were more likely to have higher proportion of glucocorticoid and lower proportion of antiviral drugs and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors treatment on admission. The difference in the use of glucocorticoid may be explained by the condition of patients with AKI that was more severe , thus physicians tended to use glucocorticoid in the most critically ill patients, even if there is a controversy on the use of glucocorticoid in COVID-19 patients. 22, 23 However, the oral antiviral drugs, including arbidol (umifenovir), oseltamivir, lopinavir and ritonavir, were preferred in moderate patients on admission. Given that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the safety and potential effects of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered. 24 Even though this study included a large number of patients from a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, it has several limitations. First, an accurate baseline serum creatinine was not available, which may have led to an underestimation of AKI or erroneous associations.

First, the novel coronavirus may exert direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissue. This is supported by the detection of PCR fragments of coronavirus in blood and urine in 2003 SARS 18 and COVID-19 patients. 4 Recently, it has been shown that the novel coronavirus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor, which is identical to that of the SARS-CoV as reported in 2003. 19 Recent human tissue RNA-seq data demonstrated thatACE2 expression in urinary organs (kidney) was nearly 100-fold higher than in respiratory organs (lung). 20 Therefore, the kidney disease may be caused by coronavirus entering kidney cells through an ACE2 dependent pathway. Second, deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T lymphocyte or antibody) may damage the kidney. However, kidney microscopy specimens from SARS patients were reported to show a normal glomerular aspect and absence of electron-dense deposits. 5 This is not in support of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Clearly, potential pathological kidney changes in COVID-19 patients require further study. Third, virus-induced cytokines or mediators might exert indirect effects on renal tissue, such as hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis. In fact, some of the 2009 H1N1 patients had mild to moderate elevations of serum creatine kinase. 21 In keeping with this observation, 138 patients with COVID-19 disease, who were admitted in ICU, showed a tendency towards increased creatine kinase levels, 13 and the patients with kidney involvement in our study tended to have increased creatine kinase levels as well.",31.577335291614855,12.74971725417053

Perspectives from Bergamo Neurosurgery Department,"We describe, with this report, the shocking effect of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak on the Department of Neurosurgery of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, which represents at the moment, the most affected city in the entire Italian territory (Figure 1 ). 1 This epidemic is challenging the Italian Government and the Healthcare System and is having a devastating impact on all the health activities, without excluding the neurosurgical reality. The first known contagion from SARS-CoV-2, causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 , was reported on February 21, in the small town of Codogno, in Lombardy. On the same day, the fist death from COVID-19 happened in Padua, and the second occurred on February 22 in Lombardy. 2 The consequent infection chain led the Italian Council of Ministers to publish a decree prohibiting the transit in and out of the outbreak areas (the so-called red areas), suspending all the public events, and introducing the quarantine for all the infected citizens, (Figure 2A ). The first cases in Bergamo were identified on February 23. Since then, the virus spread exponentially in Northern Italy, and afterwards throughout the state. Lombard hospitals were gradually overcrowded by patients with COVID-19. 3 On March 8, in an attempt to contain the epidemic, a decree of the Italian Prime Minister extended the red areas to the entire Lombardy and to other 14 Italian provinces ( Figure 2B ). This act was implemented the day after, when the whole of Italy became a red area ( Figure  2C ); 4 this was globally launched by the Government itself even in social networks, with the hashtag #iorestoacasa (#istayhome). In so doing, the movement of people throughout the country was reduced, all sports events were suspended, and teaching activities in schools and universities were stopped until April 3. By March 11, only basic shops were left open. Up to today (March 20), the total SARS-CoV-2 positive patients are 47.021, making Italy the second state with the most confirmed infections, after China. Italian death toll had recently surpassed China, becoming the country with the highest COVID-19-related mortality worldwide. 5 Bergamo is currently the most plagued Italian city and Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital is the largest health care center in the city. It comprises 1,080 beds, 83 of which are in critical care beds (53 of Intensive and 30 Subintensive Care beds). It is designed with a central area (which includes laboratories, diagnostic services, the Emergency Department, 32 operating rooms) and 7 towers all around it, each of which harbors different medical specialties. It also includes a 24-hour heliport and 280 outpatient clinics. The Hospital is home to one of the six highly specialized Trauma Centers identified by the Lombard Trauma Management Network in 2012. Moreover, it is the only Pediatric Trauma Center in the Region. The Department of Neurosurgery is one of the Hospital flagships. The neurosurgical catchment area covers nearly 1.200.000 citizens. Ten attending neurosurgeons and three residents work in the Department. There is a neurosurgeon on call 24-hours-a-day. Neurosurgical Ward includes 34 beds and another 16 beds in the dedicated Neurointensive care unit. Two operating theaters, offering 17 weekly surgical interventions, are available. In 2019, we completed 1360 surgical procedures (305 major cranial, 285 minor cranial, 191 major spinal, 483 minor spinal), including 260 urgencies, 70 pediatric procedures, and 3.630 outpatient visits were performed. 6 This solid infrastructure underwent important changes in the last two months, in accordance with the evolving COVID-19 pandemic Since the last days of February, there was a massive increase of COVID-19 cases in Bergamo, and a large number of patients overloaded the Emergency Room. Initially, they were kept in the Emergency Department or admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases. When the situation worsened further, it was necessary to activate supplementary emergency responses, which resulted in a profound reorganization of all sectors, including Neurosurgery. Many wards were closed and many other were reconverted to COVID-facilities, according to the Hospital Health Direction. On February 24, all hospitalizations for elective surgical procedures were stopped. On March 6, the Gastroenterology Department was converted to a ""Gastro-COVID"" unit; after two days the ""Pneumo-COVID"" was created, and on March 10 the Department of Neurology became the ""Neuro-COVID"". Lastly, the Department of Hematology was transformed into the ""Hemato-COVID"" on March 17. New intensive care areas were created, taking mechanical ventilators from the dismissed operating rooms. Inside the so-called ""COVID-Towers"", 400 total beds have been established for COVID-19 patients, and 92 additional beds in the Intensive Care Units. All units are currently saturated. Four intensive positions are available for cardiac emergencies or pediatric trauma. In the Emergency Department, 42 beds are at disposal, and 4 others advanced stations are located in the Shock Room. In order to streamline the constant flow of people, the triage system was extended even in the parking space. The actual number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients stands to 538 (442 in hospital ward and 96 in intensive care units), which represent the 49.8% of the Hospital total capacity. At the moment, it is not possible to increase this quantity for the lack of workers, and the critical issues associated with COVID-19 infected hospital staff. Moreover, there exists a significant deficiency of personal protective equipment, medications (i.e. antiviral drugs, antibiotics), medical devices and even oxygen. The opening of these special areas required the recruitment of medical and nursing staff (even without specific skills) in treating pulmonary or infectious diseases, taken from both local medical and surgical Departments. 7 On March 6, 25% of the neurosurgical staff was assigned to COVID-towers; this percentage arose to 50% on March 13, and to 75% since March 20. This deficit was accompanied by a concomitant overall reduction of neurosurgical activities. Hospitalized patients were gradually discharged, and the Department of Neurosurgery was closed on March 12. On call duty 24/7 was also terminated, and our last patients were moved to a new temporary Ward of ten beds, in common with orthopedic surgeons and otolaryngologists. Outpatient visits were unaffected until March 6, at which time they were reduced to a weekly session for urgencies and another one for cerebral and spinal oncological cases. Surgical activity was regular with 17 intervention per week until March 1, when seven slots were withdrawn, and only ten surgical procedures were allowed. In the week from 9 to 15 March, only four urgent operations were performed; and following 15 March, no procedures were performed. In order to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the Regional Health System adopted different urgent containment measures. 8 On March 8, with the Decree XI/2906, 9 the Lombard Health System was reorganized and the regional neurosurgical network was concentrated in 4 Hub Hospitals: three of them for cranial or spinal emergencies, and a fourth specialized for oncological pathologies (Figure 3) . Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital remained the reference point for pediatric trauma, while all the other Lombard Departments of Neurosurgery became the Spoke of a Spoke and Hub system. In this way, Hub Hospitals were free to deal with specific medical or surgical emergencies, while Spoke Hospitals focused on COVID-19 patients. Even if in Italy the national Health Care System is mainly public, Research Hospitals and accredited private Hospitals were included in this network. As of today, no pediatric traumatic emergencies were sent to our Institution. This is significatively below the expectations, 9 and likely has resulted from legitimate curfew instituted by the government to limit contagious spread of the virus, with the unexpected advantage associated with a reduced risk of traumatic injuries. The true efficacy of this system still needs to be clarified when further data, when such becomes available. The recent literature suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spreading is still expected to propagate exponentially. 10 Therefore, the readiness of foreign Health Systems will continue to be challenged worldwide. The Italian experience has demonstrated the priceless contribution of neurosurgeons and other not-specialized physicians dealing with COVID-19, where all the available resources are needed. The world is fighting a battle with an invisible common enemy, which must be won.",28.249933233815312,14.188927146628755

In 2019, Chen et al. found that SARS-CoV Viroporin 3a triggered the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages, suggesting SARS-CoV induced cell pyroptosis [89] . Studies have shown that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have increased IL-1β in the serum [26] . As the rise of IL-1β is a downstream indicator of cell pyroptosis, this may suggest that cell pyroptotic activity is likely to be activated and involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, as both classical and nonclassical pyroptosis signaling can induce the release of IL-1β, it is unclear which pathway is involved in COVID-19. Based on existing data, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to cause cell pyroptosis, especially in lymphocytes, through the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The pathways involved in the activation of the signaling between NLRP3m IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD are illustrated in Fig. 6 and are a subject of study in samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients [90] .",26.836209127442423,11.804710972505545

The likely belief for this being a concern relates to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated in tears, albeit to date, infrequently [18] and also that the virus is known to be transferred by hand contact, and thus could be transferred to contact lenses during their application and removal. In one report, positive tear and conjunctival secretions occurred in a single patient who developed conjunctivitis from a cohort of thirty patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia [18] . In another report [19] , 64 samples of the tear film from 17 patients with COVID-19 showed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 by viral culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, the frequency of conjunctivitis in patients with COVID-19 reported to date is low, at < 3% [18, 20] , although it has been suggested that CoVs could possibly be transmitted by aerosol contact with the conjunctiva in patients with active disease [18, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, the question of whether COVID-19 can occur through conjunctival exposure remains unknown [7] .

For example, aggressive public health steps to contain the spread of the virus locally may make it relatively safe for a patient to start an immunosuppressive therapy. Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic may trigger a large number of neurologists and patients to reconsider treatment strategy and choice of initial DMT and to opt for less effective immunomodulatory DMTs. This change needs to be considered carefully. The COVID-19 pandemic in all likelihood will be short lived and it would be unfair to patients treated during the epidemic to be disadvantaged in the long term regarding the management of their MS. Neurologists have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort to activate the MS community: to advance the principle that 'time is brain', to treat MS proactively to a target of no evident disease activity (NEDA) and more recently, to flip the pyramid and use higher efficacy treatments first line. These treatment principles are evidence-based and should not be thrown out in the context of a potential, but yet undefined, risk to our patients.",33.04220716345071,13.448096313732027
moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with COVID-19 infection,0.37211091169500754,1.7171211242675781,2.385866641998291,350004ad-ad2b-4fda-a0be-43e70fa422bc,custom_license/The COVID-19 pandemic and the use of MS disease-modifying therapies,"We could argue that solid-organ transplant patients are significantly more immunocompromised than pwMS on disease modifying treatment (DMT). Most transplant patients are on triple immunotherapy, compared to pwMS who are on monotherapy and even then, the level of immunosuppression is generally low. Hence, the mortality/morbidity risk to an individual on a DMT, infected with COVID-19, may be actually quite moderate to low. Another hypothesis being considered is that moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with COVID-19 infection. The severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by an over-exuberant immune response to the virus (Ramanathan et al., 2020) . As a result, several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in China and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus. Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxxx (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferon beta is also being trialled in COVID-19 based on its antiviral properties (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276688). Then there is the virology to take into account. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species (Andersen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. As it is a small RNA virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution. Vaccines take time to be developed, tested and introduced at a population level. Delaying treatment, de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory DMTs, such as interferonbeta, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, or interrupting dosing of DMTs to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of MS, especially as it may take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine. We, therefore, need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of COVID-19 in individuals with MS. If patients have active MS they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy DMTs. This should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virus.",29.79508071727059,13.095220299117521

There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. Main methods: In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. Key findings: The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically. Significance: The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19.

Running costs are low because Fangcang shelter hospitals require fewer doctors and nurses than traditional hospitals. 36 The low health worker-to-patient ratio is for two reasons: first, all patients in the hospital share the same primary admission diagnosis, reducing the complexity of care, and second, all patients have only mild to moderate disease. 9,37 By isolating and treating only mild to moderate cases, Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan freed up the scarce medical infra structure of higher-level hospitals, such as the inpatient units providing respiratory support and intensive care, for patients with severe to critical COVID-19 and other patients requiring critical or complex care. More than 90% of severe cases in Hubei province were in Wuhan, 38 and the bed vacancy rate in the traditional hospitals designated for the care of patients with COVID-19 increased from 4% on Feb 4, 2020 (before the first Fangcang shelter hospitals had opened) to 16% on Feb 22, when 16 Fangcang shelter hospitals had started admitting patients. 38 The Fangcang shelter hospitals improved the distribution of patients with COVID-19 according to the severity of their symptoms, increasing the overall efficiency of care. Figure 3 summarises the functions of Fangcang shelter hospitals. The first essential function is isolation. Before the construction of the hospitals, thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in Wuhan had to be sent home for isolation. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms are generally more active than the severely ill and thus in greater contact with others, increasing the possibility of transmission and placing family and community members at risk. 39 The Fangcang shelter hospitals isolated COVID-19 patients more effectively from their communities than home isolation.",31.47025484359133,13.417775200610894

The Fangcang shelter hospitals, which can be rapidly established, 4, 5 can provide large numbers of hospital beds and appropriate care for patients who do not have severe or critical disease. 5, 6 Health workers at Fangcang shelter hospitals can transfer patients to higher-level hospitals for more complex treatment if their conditions worsen. 6 Fangcang shelter hospitals can also offer emotional and social support to help patients recover and thrive during an otherwise disruptive period in their lives. 6 In this report, we document the conception and dev elop ment of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, describe their key characteristics and essential functions, discuss critical issues for the success of Fangcang shelter hospitals, and consider applications of the concept as part of the COVID-19 public health response in other countries. on the city's medical system. 7 At the beginning of February, 2020, Wuhan had no beds available for COVID-19 patients in the hospitals designated for treating the virus. 8 Thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 had to be sent home for isolation and observation. With a shortage of hospital beds, Wuhan needed an approach to rapidly and massively scale its capacity to isolate and care for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. As the outbreak in Wuhan reached its most severe point, with thousands of new infections per day, the city opened three Fangcang shelter hospitals on Feb 5, 2020, by converting exhibition centres and stadiums. Over the following weeks, Wuhan opened an additional 13 Fangcang shelter hospitals. 9 Figure 1 shows the progression of bed capacity and occupancy of the Fangcang shelter hospitals over time. As the epidemic in Wuhan subsided and bed occupancy moved towards zero, the Fangcang shelter hospitals were successively suspended. The first hospital closed on March 1, 2020; by March 10, all Fangcang shelter hospitals had been suspended. 10, 11 Home isolation is an important alternative to hospital isolation, which requires behaviour change but no additional infrastructure investment. Chinese policy makers decided against home isolation of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 for a number of important reasons. 12, 13 First, home isolation puts patients' family members at risk. Early epidemiological evidence in China showed that more than half of all patients with COVID-19 had at least one family member with the disease, and 75-80% of all clustered infections were within families, suggesting high rates of intrafamily transmission. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Second, patients can find home isolation psychologically taxing, because they know that they are putting those they care about most at risk of contracting the disease. 19, 20 Third, home isolation is unlikely to be fully effective because it cannot be strictly enforced. Patients might break with the mandated behaviour to stay at home and go outside for errands, entertainment, or exercise. Lastly, it is difficult to organise medical care, frequent monitoring of disease progression, and timely referral to hospital care for thousands of patients in home isolation. 21 COVID-19 can deteriorate from mild or moderate to severe illness, requiring rapid referral to hospital care. [16] [17] [18] In home isolation in Wuhan, before the introduction of the Fangcang shelter hospitals, the time from onset of severe symptoms to admission to a tertiary hospital for intensive care was up to 10 days. 8, 22 The Fangcang shelter hospitals substantially reduced these delays.",30.014798822749302,12.438061682345495

The hospitals were built in existing public venues by installing beds, sheltered space, and the three zones and two passages (san qu liang tong dao) of hospital isolation wards.

The zoonotic source of SARS-CoV-2 is not confirmed, however, sequence-based analysis suggested bats as the key reservoir. DNA recombination was found to be involved at spike glycoprotein which assorted SARS-CoV (CoVZXC21 or CoVZC45) with the RBD of another Beta CoV, thus could be the reason for cross-species transmission and rapid infection. According to phylogenetic trees, SARS-CoV is closer to SARS-like bat CoVs. Until now, no promising clinical treatments or prevention strategies have been developed against human coronaviruses. However, the researchers are working to develop efficient therapeutic strategies to cope with the novel coronaviruses. Various broad-spectrum antivirals previously used against influenza, SARS and MERS coronaviruses have been evaluated either alone or in combinations to treat COVID-19 patients, mice models, and clinical isolates. Remdesivir, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, and Oseltamivir significantly blocked the COVID-19 infection in infected patients.

France is now facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 4500 cases, as of March 14 th 2020 [5] . Thus, there is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage in order to limit the transmission in the community.

However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infection, which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. We explored kinetics of mHLA-DR expression, the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients, in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Twenty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, of which 75% was male and 79% had comorbidities. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited large high levels of inflammatory parameters such as CRP and PCT. mHLA-DR expression levels were mostly within the normal range of 15000-45000 mAb/cell and showed no change over time. COVID-19 patients displayed notably higher mHLA-DR expression levels compared with bacterial septic shock patients. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection.

The French open label non-randomized clinical trial was promising and the first clinical trial of these medication on COVID-19 patients. The effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significant because it showed reduction in the viral load when it compared with the control group (22) . Moreover, the effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more effective when azithromycin was added to the patients according to their clinical needs. However, clinical follow-up and occurrence of adverse effects were not discussed in the paper; further work should be done on these medicines to reduce the spread of .

Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P<0.001).
