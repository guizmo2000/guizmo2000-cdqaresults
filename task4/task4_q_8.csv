A symptomatic patient's autonomy to not seek treatment (and not be isolated) is weighed against the threat of disease transmission by staying in the community. The injustice of treatment variability, across regions and over time, places patients at differential risk of death. In acting beneficently, healthcare workers inherently place themselves at some risk. A natural response is to balance that risk with the duty to help. This frequently conspires against greater numbers of health workers responding to an Ebola outbreak. The duty to nonmaleficence, doing no harm, is a daily conundrum, through potential delays in routine diagnostic work-up for common illnesses because of a lack of diagnostic testing, or, in resource-constrained environments, inadequate space to separate potentially infectious suspect patients along a gradient of risk.",19.40396958921204,13.437455497352754

In addition, our data clearly indicate that efforts to regularly disinfect environmental surfaces and ensure clean towels for patient caregiving could reduce risk of exposure to patients, healthcare staff and visitors. The government of Bangladesh has taken a number of initiatives to improve infection control in hospitals [36] . Despite this, a 2013 nationally representative survey of healthcare facilities showed that healthcare workers performed recommended hand hygiene in only 9% of 919 opportunities, suggesting low adherence to international standards [30] . Barriers include awareness, training, accountability and appropriate infrastructure (among 875 health facilities, 10% handwashing locations had no water, 20% had no soap and 50-80% had no alcohol based sanitizer) to support these behaviours [30, 37, 38] This study highlighted the gaps in practice, as well as the substantial barriers to improvement that will require widespread investments to address. In 2018, the Directorate of Hospital Infection Control, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in Bangladesh has communicated the intention to form infection control committees in each district and tertiary care hospital across the country to improve the safe care [39] .

This may be because the use of coping strategies can be contextdependent. Since the specific stressful events that require coping at T1 and T2 may differ, contextual changes may affect coping more than changes that result from training. On the other hand, the lack of change in these variables may be because prior to training most participants tended to use problem-solving and support seeking frequently and escape-avoidance infrequently, and thus there was only room for improvement in a subset of the sample. Among those who report under-utilizing support-seeking or problem solving or over-utilizing escape-avoidance at T1, the training was associated with an improvement. There was a substantial attrition of about 40% of healthcare workers who consented to participate in the course but did not take the training. Since these people did not commence taking the course, the attrition is not attributable to their reactions the course itself, and may rather represent an insufficiently considered intention to take the training, obstacles to finding time (such as high competing demands for healthcare workers' time) or a lack of motivation (due to low perceived salience of pandemic stress prior to an actual pandemic or other factors). Since there was no follow-up with drop-outs in this study to determine reasons for attrition, future research is required to identify barriers to learning and the extent of perceived need for resilience training, especially in nonprofessional hospital staff for whom drop-out rates were highest. Empirically demonstrated efficacy would likely bolster the appeal of this training. Once healthcare workers commence the course, dropping out is less common (20%).",22.21431433848973,11.393145566109345

For this pilot we focused instead on proximal outcomes which could facilitate resilience. Studies of the individual and health-system variables which mediated the outcomes of stress related to SARS suggested that the best goals of training would be to (i) increase confidence in being well-supported by the hospital and well-prepared for the pandemic and (ii) enhance adaptive strategies of coping (increasing problem solving and seeking support and decreasing escape-avoidance) [13] . Since the purpose of effective training is to change the behavior of healthcare workers in a pandemic situation, we also proposed, based on the theory of social learning [21] , that enhancing self-efficacy (expectations about personal ability to respond adaptively to pandemic-related stresses) should be a goal of training because it is expected to be a proximal predictor of behavior [22] . Finally, since many stressful aspects of an infectious disease outbreak are directly or indirectly of an interpersonal nature (e.g. concern for family health, interpersonal job stresses, interpersonal isolation and perceived stigma) and because interpersonal problems are associated with job stress in healthcare workers [23] , reducing interpersonal problems was a goal.

However, overall transmission potential for MERS is lower compared to SARS [3] and its outbreaks have been contained with much lower cumulative numbers of infected individuals than was the case for SARS. Prior studies showed that human-to-human transmission of SARS occurred via close contact and respiratory droplets [4] , while that of MERS occurred via close contact only [5] . A large proportion of MERS cases were clustered in healthcare settings, most of which were contributed by unprotected close contact between healthcare workers and infected MERS patients.

Innumerable challenges to improving hand hygiene in resource-limited settings have been identified, but reasons vary from location to location [83] . Convincing evidence indicates that implementation of multimodal hand hygiene programs can not only improve hand hygiene compliance but also reduce ICU-acquired infection rates. A prospective observational study involving 99 ICUs in 19 resource-limited countries demonstrated a significant 23.1% overall increase in hand hygiene compliance after implementation of a multidimensional hand hygiene program involving administrative support, supply availability, education and training, workplace reminders, process surveillance, and performance feedback [84] .

In some cases, viral infection can be acquired when the infant passes through the birth canal during a vaginal delivery or through post-partum breast feeding, although these mechanisms would be highly unusual for a respiratory virus. Neonatal infection from respiratory viruses can occur after delivery through such mechanisms as inhalation of the agent through aerosols produced by coughing from the mother, relatives or healthcare workers or other sources in the hospital environment. Based upon past experience with pregnant women who developed MERS and SARS, and realizing that the numbers are limited, there has never been confirmed intrauterine coronavirus transmission from mother to fetus.

In addition to standard hygienic measures, adequate hand hygiene in particular, the use of masks has been recommended to protect healthcare workers caring for (critically ill) patients with acute respiratory infections. Despite surrogate exposure studies indicating that N95 respirators are associated with less filter penetration and inward leakage than surgical masks, large clinical trials and meta-analyses failed to show that N95 respirators are superior to surgical masks in protecting healthcare workers against influenza during routine care [107] [108] [109] .

Participants at the African meeting felt that healthcare workers have the right to stop working if they feel they are not wellprotected. Factors discussed included the challenges related to the displacement of health workers during post-election conflict, traditional or cultural practices that may increase the risk of disease spread (eg, hugging or handshaking), and conflicts between senior officials and frontline healthcare workers regarding access to resources. They felt that frontline health workers should have first priority. A complicating factor in many African countries is the presence of large numbers of health-care-related NGOs from a variety of countries. What obligations would they have in a pandemic? If the workers or the organizations were to leave the country to attend to the needs of their home country or their families, the African country could lose a sizable proportion of its health workforce. And yet host governments have little authority to demand their assistance. Socio-economic factors were predominant in stories told by participants at the Asian meeting. For example, during SARS outbreak, some private hospitals in one country were only admitting patients who could pay, while some suspected patients did not go to hospitals because they could not pay the inpatient care that could exceed $250 per day in a country where per capita annual income is less than $3000. Some countries reported lack of personal protective equipment, such as face masks, for healthcare workers; or differences in the degree of protection offered according to position (eg, physicians offered more protection than nurses). Participants reported that some healthcare workers refused to treat suspected cases, because either they did not have protective equipment and/ or because they were concerned for their own safety and the safety of their loved ones to whom they would return after work. The participants agreed that healthcare facilities and governments had an ethical obligation to adequately and equitably provide personal protective equipment to their employees. In addition, participants felt that education of the employees about transmission control and, in some instances, additional incentives such as hazard pay, can help overcome the hesitancy of healthcare workers to remain on duty during a pandemic surge in cases. Participants at the Latin American and Eastern Mediterranean meetings also discussed the roles of healthcare workers during influenza pandemic. Participants at both meetings recognized the important responsibilities healthcare workers have to treat patients regardless of the risk to themselves, but also noted that governments have responsibilities to protect healthcare workers. Some participants believed that healthcare workers have the right to refuse treatment to patients if the provider fears exposing their own family and that society has an obligation to compensate their families if they die while treating patients.

Drawing from these experiences, others have warned that an influenza pandemic will impose similar foreseeable risks to physicians and other healthcare workers [40] . This raises an ethical dilemma about the extent of the professional duty of caregivers during a pandemic versus the limits to health risk to themselves and to their families that healthcare workers need accept [41] . It may be argued that if provided with the appropriate equipment or supplies necessary to treat, practitioners should be obligated to treat someone with any illness. The NISPPI mentions procuring and distributing protective clothing, masks, aprons, and gloves. This is laudable; however, being prepared requires not only that health workers are aware that they have masks that they can use during a pandemic but also that they have the requisite training on how to use personal protective equipment safely and effectively. Indeed, it is required of planners to acknowledge limitations of various proposed actions or interventions (both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical) [42] .

The meetings were attended by 168 health professionals, scientists, academics, ethicists, religious leaders, and other community members representing 40 countries in these regions. Methods: We reviewed the meeting reports, notes and stories and mapped outcomes to the key ethical challenges for pandemic influenza response described in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) guidance, Ethical Considerations in Developing a Public Health Response to Pandemic Influenza: transparency and public engagement, allocation of resources, social distancing, obligations to and of healthcare workers, and international collaboration. Results: The important role of transparency and public engagement were widely accepted among participants. However, there was general agreement that no ""one size fits all"" approach to allocating resources can address the variety of economic, cultural and other contextual factors that must be taken into account. The importance of social distancing as a tool to limit disease transmission was also recognized, but the difficulties associated with this measure were acknowledged. There was agreement that healthcare workers often have competing obligations and that government has a responsibility to assist healthcare workers in doing their job by providing appropriate training and equipment. Finally, there was agreement about the importance of international collaboration for combating global health threats. Conclusion: Although some cultural differences in the values that frame pandemic preparedness and response efforts were observed, participants generally agreed on the key ethical principles discussed in the WHO's guidance. Most significantly the input gathered from these regional meetings pointed to the important role that procedural ethics can play in bringing people and countries together to respond to the shared health threat posed by a pandemic influenza despite the existence of cultural differences.",20.96257981667187,8.992071931096346

Vaccination uptake was highest among healthcare workers and avoidance behaviors were the highest among contacts of influenza cases. Healthcare workers and contacts have had greater and more direct exposure to influenza cases compared to the general population and this first-hand experience may have resulted in behavioral changes. This possibly reflects the effect of actual real-life experiences with influenza on individual behavior. It will therefore be important to determine solutions to instill the same level of positive behaviors in the general population without the need for prior infection or the personal experience such as being close contacts or healthcare workers. One possible solution would be the sharing and imparting of personal experiences to the general community Ethnicity may also play a role in determining practices. We found that Malays (an ethnic minority) had significantly higher positive practices as compared to the Chinese (the ethnic majority). The Indians (another ethnic minority) also had higher practice scores as compared to the Chinese although this was not statistically significant. A previous study also reported that the ethnic minority groups had a 3.2 times higher likelihood of making recommended changes during this current influenza pandemic [9] . Another multi-ethnic study on a different subject (terrorism) showed that worry and voidance behaviours were more common among minority groups, suggesting that this effect may be due to shared perceptions of vulnerability or low levels of control [20] but further research is required to determine the actual causes for this phenomenon during epidemics. Overall efforts at increasing positive behaviours should therefore be rolled out to the entire population, with special focus on the ethnic majority. We found that age, sex, and housing-type (as a proxy of socio-economic status) did not predict knowledge, attitudes or practices. However, the vast majority (> 80%) of our participants were from the 19-23 age group due to the inherent nature of the military and our study was not structured to detect any differences due to extremes of age. In another pandemic study in the United Kingdom, younger age was found to have greater uptake of recommended behaviors but not for sex and household income [9] . However, another study on behavioral changes during SARS found that the older age had an increased beneficial effect on behavioral change but not sex [2] .

ARIs are particularly important during early life as infants have the highest infection rates and they can transmit infectious agents to other household members [1] . Recently introduced molecular-based diagnostic techniques have much improved sensitivity compared with previous classical culture and phenotypic-based methods and have led to the discovery of new respiratory viruses [2] . However, contemporary studies employing these new techniques have often used convenience samples obtained from patients admitted to hospital or attending Emergency Department clinics [3] [4] [5] . Understanding more fully the ARI disease burden in the community is important for developing public health interventions, such as vaccination programs [6] , and for understanding the role respiratory viruses may play in the pathogenesis of certain chronic pulmonary disorders, such as asthma [7] [8] [9] . This has led to the instigation of community-based studies. Such studies do however have some logistical challenges, particularly concerning respiratory sample collection and transport. Most studies have relied upon clinic or home visits by trained healthcare workers to collect specimens during an ARI episode, which imposes restrictions upon busy families and may lead to biased disease estimates and specimen availability [10] [11] [12] . Cost and feasibility of using healthcare workers are also important when large longitudinal, community-based cohort studies, involving frequent specimen collections, are planned. To help address these limitations, we and others have begun testing parentcollected, anterior nasal swab specimens that have been transported to the research laboratory using the standard mail [13] [14] [15] [16] .

In the late 1980s and 1990s, significant focus was on the risk of HIV exposure with multiple studies making strong arguments for universal precautions during code situations [2] . While the incidence of needlestick injuries among healthcare workers during routine medical care has been well documented in the literature, code situations undoubtedly present a higher risk. During resuscitative attempts, multiple providers are using needles for venipuncture, arterial blood gas sampling, and emergent placement of central venous catheters, often during active patient motion related to repositioning or CPR efforts. Despite this, very little has been published on the topic of needlestick injuries during resuscitation. One case report describes a resident physician who sustained a needlestick injury while attempting to place a central line; he appropriately reported the injury and received post-exposure prophylaxis [3] .

This change in habit could be a confounder underscoring the effect of single room isolation using interrupted time series analysis. In fact, the incidence density of ICU onset MRSA infection had a significant change in level and trend before and after SARS. This finding illustrates an important principle that the compliance with infection control practices by healthcare workers is determined by the perception of staff that their own personal safety may be threatened if such measures are not followed. The overwhelming effect of SARS on the risk perception by ICU healthcare workers was reported by over 77% of our staff who have participated in the questionnaire survey earlier on reporting a higher rate of hand cleansing practice after exposure to patient's body fluids [10] .

However, the incidence density of ICU onset infection due to ESBL-producing organisms steadily increased after the outbreak of SARS when patients infected with ESBLproducing organisms were not managed in the single rooms ( Figure 5 ). The use of single room isolation as the predominant measure to control the spread of MRSA in ICU remains controversial in the literature (Table 3) [2] [3] [4] 7, 8] . A well designed study failed to demonstrate any significant reduction in the incidence of nosocomial acquisition of MRSA in 2 intensive care units where MRSA carriers were managed in single rooms [7] . The low compliance rate with hand hygiene practice of 21% was considered as the major limiting factor to successful infection control. Poor adherence to hand hygiene practice negated the effect of hospital renovation with the provision of single rooms [18] . Therefore, the implementation of hand hygiene has become the crucial factor in the control of MRSA. As shown in our study, despite a significant increase in the incidence density of pre-ICU onset MRSA infection which may increase the colonization pressure in ICU [19] , the incidence density of both ICU onset nonbacteraemic and bacteraemic MRSA infection further decreased in phase 3 when hand hygiene campaign was promoted which resulted in a sustained improvement in the compliance rate of over 60% across all ranks of healthcare workers.",19.31991221156517,9.369440167907673

First, hand hygiene compliance was considered low among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia for physicians (27%) and nurses (29%), with no statistical difference observed between the two. This finding is consistent with the literature. According to Caglar et.al [14] , an extensive literature review about hand hygiene practices among healthcare workers indicated that only 12.9% to 56% were compliant. For the self-report questionnaires, nurses reported higher hand hygiene compliance than physicians. Similarly, Harris et al. [20] found that non-physicians reported a higher compliance with hand hygiene when compared to physicians. Healthcare workers' beliefs, based on self-report questionnaire responses, and actual behaviors, as noted by the primary researcher's observations, did not correlate. This element of the data implied that the healthcare workers believed themselves to be more compliant with hand hygiene procedures than they actually were. A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be ignorance of hand hygiene protocols or failure to be aware of their own hand hygiene behavior.",26.067909852415752,11.332838677875847

Although harm was not demonstrated in the context of this experimental protocol, the significant changes to respiratory physiology caused by breathing through N95 mask materials raise the concern regarding prolonged use of N95-masks by pregnant healthcare workers. Our results suggest that pregnant women may experience more fatigue and require more rest breaks from mask use.

In face of the imminent threat of pandemic airborne respiratory diseases it should be emphasized that the benefit of using N95 mask to prevent serious emerging infectious diseases should be weighed against possible respiratory consequences associated with N95 mask usage. Use of alternative protective methods such as surgical masks with lesser airway resistance, should be considered in appropriate settings [31] [32] [33] .

This is similar to an unblinded randomized controlled trial of adults taking oseltamivir or given influenza vaccine for the prevention of influenza infection. In that study, 10% of participants discontinued prophylaxis due to side effects over a full influenza season. 21 In comparison, in three blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials only 1-2% of participants in each study arm discontinued zanamivir, oseltamivir or placebo prophylaxis due to side effects experienced during treatment. [6] [7] [8] In adults, seasonal influenza vaccines prevent about 59% of laboratory-confirmed influenza illnesses compared with no vaccine. 5 In randomized, placebo-controlled studies of antiviral prophylaxis, the protective efficacy of zanamivir and oseltamivir against laboratory-confirmed influenza ranged from 31 to 83% in adults and adolescents in studies that ranged in duration from 28 days to 6 weeks.

Three participants in the antiviral arm were vaccinated between medication start and end-of-season (included); see Figure 1 for participants per blood draw. conducted in our facility in the 2007-2008 season, 21 highlight the fact that neither option is perfect, but that both provide greater protection than no intervention. Antiviral prophylaxis may provide protection for those at higher risk of contracting, transmitting, and/or suffering severe consequences of infection caused by influenza strains not included in the seasonal vaccines (e.g. during a pandemic or a year with significant mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains). In this study, the direct provision of patient care and exposure to a patient with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection in the previous week were both associated with higher odds of illness. This is consistent with other studies reporting that people working in healthcare institutions are at higher risk of acute respiratory illness than people working in other professions. 9,10, 22 Williams et al. 10 report that people working in acute care hospitals in Germany had higher odds of reporting ARI during the 2006-2007 influenza season than people working for other employers after adjusting for age, sex and smoking status. In the current study, the risk of an acute respiratory illness was also higher for participants who were exposed to their spouse or child who was ill during the previous week.

Laboratory confirmation of SARS is crucial in the management of patients presenting with pneumonia, particularly as the clinical features of SARS make it difficult to distinguish from other causes of atypical pneumonia. Molecular methods for SARS diagnosis are useful, although their value is affected by the observation that maximal viral shedding occurs after the first week of illness rather than at the initial clinical presentation. The SARS outbreak was characterized by high infection rates in healthcare workers; patient self-collected specimens such as throat washes or feces, or serum may pose less risk to healthcare workers, particularly in the context of concerns about nosocomial acquisition. Although NPAs and other lower respiratory tract samples are the sample of choice for suspected respiratory viral infections, patient self-collected specimens are suitable for RT-PCR. Thus they offer diagnostic value, especially in SARS where the peak of viral shedding is after the first week of illness, and this sampling approach may reduce the safety issues of healthcare workers collecting NPAs. Patient self-collected specimens may be less appropriate for common seasonal respiratory virus infections such as influenza, where viral shedding is maximal at clinical presentation and virus is rarely detected outside the respiratory tract.

Volunteering for such a mission can have major implications for the volunteers themselves and for their families [9] [10] [11] . The volunteers report positive experiences that reached far beyond their daily work, such as a change in their priorities in life and a greater appreciation of the value of their own lives. Although the volunteers reported that temperature monitoring did not make them feel that their daily activities were restricted, fully complying with temperature monitoring and reporting it to the authorities was low. The volunteers did not fear infection with Ebola or infecting their families, and they were not afraid of being stigmatized. With respect to the burden on family members, 50% reported that their family members were worried that the volunteer would be infected with Ebola virus. Our paper shows that those who did volunteer derived a lot of satisfaction from their experiences. Most of our respondents were not worried about being infected with Ebola or infecting family members. Nevertheless, their families were concerned. This effect has also found in other studies, such as the one reporting on a patient with Marburg hemorrhagic fever. In that study, 40% of the 130 contacts reported that their family members expressed anxiety about becoming infected, and over 30% reported that their partners were disturbed by the restrictive control measures [7] . In another study of the experiences of Dutch healthcare workers caring for a suspected Ebola patient, we found that family members of healthcare workers were afraid and anxious [12] . One explanation may be that healthcare workers are better informed about the risks and protective measures than their family members are, which reduces worry and anxiety. However, family members' fears and anxieties can influence the volunteer's decision to participate in such a mission. For those volunteering in the event of future outbreaks, it is important that the families' worries are addressed at an early stage of the recruitment.",23.44066939433031,10.24055024770761

Briefly, the model is based on a modified susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental model. At pandemic onset, the population is fully susceptible S to infection upon contact with an infectious individual. Individuals then enter an exposed class (infected but not yet infectious) where they can receive prophylaxis (E p ) or not (E np ). Infectious individuals can either present for healthcare (I) or not (A), and those who present can either receive treatment (I np,t ) or not (I np,nt ). Once recovered from infection (R Inp , R Anp , R Ip , R Ap ), individuals are assumed to be fully resistant to reinfection. The model also incorporates a dynamic ""contact"" label, applied to a fixed number of individuals drawn from the whole population each time a new infectious case appears. This allows simulation of targeted post-exposure antiviral prophylaxis (PEP). The Australian population was stratified into five distinct risk groups (young children, elderly, high-risk, health care workers, and the general adult population), to allow for differential risks of severe outcomes, differential benefits conferred by antiviral treatment, and targeted treatment and prophylaxis strategies. It was assumed that these groups mixed homogeneously. All simulations were performed as described by Moss and colleagues [1] .

Furthermore, the changes and uncertainties in the emergency care setting during an epidemic worsen those issues and create unique challenges and obstacles to nursing practices. Indeed, change and uncertainty, which are inherent to the nature of the healthcare industry, are inevitable challenges facing nurses and other healthcare workers, and they create hesitation and fear and that affects the performance and quality of care delivery (Arrowsmith, Lau-Walker, Norman, & Maben, 2016) .

This result is not in accordance with another study in which the highest attitude of healthcare workers was noted towards active participation in hospital control program [24] . The effect of gender and attitude could be well explained by the traditional norms and customs in Saudi Arabia. Males have more interaction and socialization than females. Their inclination towards meeting other healthcare professionals and specialists is more as compared to their female counterpart. This could influence their attitude towards their involvement in infection control measures to reduce the prevalence of MERS. Similarly, physicians were more positive in attitude as compared to healthcare professionals because of their in depth clinical training on infection control and greater opportunities of professional development as compared to other team members.

Better means of protection require understanding how healthcare workers were infected and assessing their role in disease transmission. Here, we describe a method for estimating the temporal profile of the risk of infection and probability of transmission in the community and hospitals. The 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong is used as an example. For the SARS epidemic, we show that the risk of infection in the community and hospitals decreased with time down to zero in hospitals but remained larger in the community. This observation suggests that public health measures and behavioural changes most effectively reduced transmission in hospitals. Besides, we find that the large number of cases observed among healthcare workers is more likely a result of large and sustained exposure to hospitalized cases than to transmission among healthcare workers. These results are of interest to design control measures in the event of an influenza pandemic. general population. In particular, susceptible individuals in the general population (S gp compartment) cannot be infected by infectious hospitalized SARS cases (H gp , H hw , and H hp compartments), and susceptible hospitalized patients (S hp compartment) cannot be infected by infectious not-yet-hospitalized cases from the general population (I gp compartment).",27.11466590385934,14.982405288392853

MERS-CoV can clinically appear with mild or nonspecific respiratory symptoms, and patients may seek care without having known risk factors for infection. Maintaining a high index of suspicion in every patient encounter, especially at first points of patient entry such as EDs or primary healthcare settings, is imperative, particularly in regions reporting MERS-CoV cases. Early detection of cases, full adherence to infection prevention recommendations, and recognition of illness among HCWs are necessary factors to prevent further transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings.

Likewise, the shorter is the period at risk (and therefore the predicted duration of prophylaxis) the higher is the possibility that prophylaxis will work. However, the prediction of an incidence of infection is not simple, and requires an analysis of various factors including patient's prior exposure to pathogens, underlying disease, previous and current treatment, comorbidities, geographic area and others. Therefore, three questions are critical in de fi ning the appropriateness of antimicrobial prophylaxis: what is the risk for infection; what are the pathogens that predominate in this setting; and what is the period at risk. Table 51 .1 provides a risk-targeted approach to prophylaxis of infections in patients with hematological malignancies and Table 51 .2 presents the most frequent pathogens responsible for infection according to the type of immunode fi ciency present. In this chapter, we describe various strategies directed at the prevention of infections in patients with hematological malignancies, according to this risk-based strategy. Risk assessment in each underlying disease (e.g. age, initial white blood cell count, cytogenetics, immunophenotype, rapidity of cytoreduction in acute lymphoid leukemia; advanced age, de novo vs. secondary leukemia, prior myelodysplasia, cytogenetics, gene mutation pro fi le in acute myeloid leukemia; mutational status of immunoglobulin Vh gene and chromosomal abnormalities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia) b Most common disease-related immunosuppression include: hypogammaglobulinemia (multiple myeloma, low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia), T-cell mediated immunode fi ciency (Hodgkin's lymphoma and certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and neutrophil dysfunction (acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia) Handwashing remains the simplest and most effective measure to prevent the acquisition of organisms by patients [ 1 ] . Patients and healthcare workers (HCW) should wash their hands before eating, smoking, or inserting or removing contact lenses, and after using the restroom, blowing their nose, coughing, sneezing, handling dirty items such as soiled gausses, or garbage and after touching an animal. In addition, healthcare workers should also wash their hands between patients. All surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned, including wrists, palms, back of hands, fi ngers and under the fi ngernails, preferably with an alcohol-based hand rub [ 2 ] . However, if hands are visibly dirty or soiled with blood or body fl uids, soap and water are best for cleaning hands [ 3 ] .

One of the main risks of contamination is contact with an infected patient, repatriated with the disease, be it already declared or not. Healthcare workers are particularly at risk of contamination [11] . To date, no aerosol transmission has been documented, nor transmission following healthy skin exposure. After contamination through human liquids (including saliva, blood, vomit, urine, etc.), the virus spreads in the organism and replicates itself at a high rate [1] . This leads to virus particles in the blood that can be as high as 10 7 plaque-forming unit/mL. The risk of transmission is very high, particularly for the medical teams. One of the goals when receiving an infected patient is to guarantee the best level of protection for healthcare providers. The risk of contamination for laboratory personnel is low thanks to laboratory procedures. To date, 4 accidents during laboratory work with Ebola virus have been reported: 1 case was fatal, 1 case was symptomatic and survived and in 2 cases there was no evidence that the accident resulted in infection and the patients survived [11] . Thus, one can assume the same level of risk for health team members. As recently seen in Spain, despite wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), a nurse was contaminated during the care of an infected patient [12] . In Texas, a delay in EVD diagnosis for a case in the emergency department led to the death of a healthcare worker and fear of several secondary cases [13] .

Analysis of this experience uncovered several important lessons. 19 First, the protection of healthcare workers is not just about PPE; it encompasses all principles of infection prevention and control. 20 Whilst the initial focus for protecting anaesthesiologists or personnel involved in aerosol-generating medical procedures (tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation before intubation, and bronchoscopy) was on the need for more stringent PPE, such as powered air-purifying respirators or double gloves during the SARS outbreak, further investigation did not support a risk of transmission with tracheal intubation if appropriate precautions and more standard PPE were used. 21 22 In areas, such as the emergency department or ICU where SARS patients were managed, there were 'uncontrolled situations characterized by multiple opportunities for extensive contamination and staff exposure prior to the intubation event'. 21 Healthcare workers were exposed to risk of infection before PPE was used. It reflects the importance of triage, early recognition, and prompt isolation for suspected cases of infected patients. 20 Second, a post-SARS investigation interviewing healthcare workers involved in the intubation of SARS patients in Toronto highlighted non-compliance or sub-optimal adherence to the use of PPE. 23 Although much is unknown about the 2019-nCoV, it is believed to spread from person to person amongst close contact via respiratory droplets and contact transmission. Strict adherence to the use of PPE, including procedure mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves, is highly effective in limiting droplet and contact transmission. 21 The current WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for the protection of personnel during aerosol-generating medical procedures in patients with confirmed/suspected 2019-nCoV centres around principles of clear communication, minimising personnel in the room during the procedure, appropriate use of PPE, and avoidance of procedures that generate high amounts of aerosols. Some considerations are provided as follows to help prepare for airway management of confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients. 20 24 25 These suggestions are by no means comprehensive. Hospitals should develop local plans for aerosolgenerating medical procedures in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients using a collaborative approach that engages anaesthesiologists, intensivists, emergency medicine physicians, respiratory therapists, resuscitation team members, infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety specialists, and environmental services staff.",23.837315344357613,12.815831276019853

The genome size is small enough to be readily manipulated as a DNA clone, but the small size also limits the amount of DNA that can be inserted and therefore the applicability of the virus for gene transfer experiments. A related problem is that for expression studies, the genome is normally deleted for the AAV genes with only the ends that function as promoter sites retained.

It also contributes to decrease viral transmission in the healthcare setting [2] . Vaccination of healthcare workers is the second most important strategy, just behind handwashing, to prevent nosocomial dissemination of influenza [41••] . Several studies have demonstrated a reduction in morbidity and mortality among patients in different healthcare settings when healthcare workers have been vaccinated against influenza [41••] . Different strategies were successfully implemented in order to increase vaccine uptake in healthcare personnel. Among these were educational campaigns regarding benefits of the vaccine for patients and personnel, actions addressed to remove administrative barriers for vaccination, implementation of accessible locations for vaccine administration and of signed declination statements, and mandatory vaccination policies for healthcare workers [52] . However, the scientific support for this last strategy has been questioned recently [53] . Antivirals against influenza have proved effective to reduce influenza viral transmission. The ones now available are the neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir. Oseltamivir which is administered through the oral route has proved to effectively prevent secondary cases of influenza among household contacts if it is given within 48 h of symptoms initiation of the index case. Zanamivir, which is administered by inhalation per mouth, has also proved effective in preventing secondary influenza cases in households and healthcare workers [54, 55] , but caution is advised, as its efficacy has only been demonstrated in particular circumstances. During a nosocomial outbreak, in high-risk patients and non-vaccinated healthcare workers, antiviral administration should be implemented. When a mismatch between the circulating influenza strain and the vaccine strain is identified, antiviral prophylaxis should be given to all healthcare workers if an outbreak occurs. Duration of antiviral administration during a nosocomial outbreak of influenza should be two weeks or one week after the outbreak control [2] . Besides vaccination and antivirals, infection control measures are of utmost importance in order to prevent influenza virus transmission and dissemination in the hospital environment. These measures include handwashing, limitation of visitors and of health personnel in contact with infected patients, cohort or single bed rooms isolation, and droplet precautions. Precautions to avoid aerosolization should also be implemented in case of a new pandemic strain or when performing high risk procedures (e.g. intubation) ( Table 2 ) [13] .",29.73311597857247,16.192457103368437

The two main indications for the use of gloves in the prevention of HCAI 1 are: • to protect hands from contamination with organic matter and microorganisms; and • to reduce the risk of cross-transmission of microorganisms to staff and patients. Gloves should be selected on the basis of a risk assessment, and should be suitable for the proposed task and the materials being handled. [138] [139] [140] Gloves are categorised as medical gloves (examination and surgical) and protective gloves. 145 Examination gloves are available as sterile or non-sterile for use by healthcare workers during clinical care to prevent contamination with microorganisms, blood and body Á uids. Surgical gloves are available as sterile for use by healthcare workers during surgical and other invasive procedures. Protective gloves are used to protect healthcare workers from chemical hazards. 145 Gloves should not be worn as a substitute for hand hygiene. Their prolonged and unnecessary use may cause adverse reactions and skin sensitivity, and may lead to crosscontamination of the patient environment. 1, 2 The need to wear gloves and the selection of appropriate glove materials requires careful assessment of the task to be performed and its related risks to patients and healthcare workers. 1, 2, 135, 146, 147 Risk assessment should include consideration of: • who is at risk (patient or healthcare worker) and whether sterile or non-sterile gloves are required; • potential for exposure to blood, body Á uids, secretions and excretions; • contact with non-intact skin or mucous membranes during care and invasive procedures; and • healthcare worker and patient sensitivity to glove materials. We identiÀ ed four observational studies which suggested that clinical gloves are not used in line with current guidance, and that glove use impacts negatively on hand hygiene. [148] [149] [150] [151] In addition, a cluster RCT of screening and enhanced contact precautions for patients colonised with MRSA or VRE found no reduction in transmission, but also found that adherence to contact precautions was less than ideal. 152 Gloves must be removed immediately following each care activity for which they have been worn, and hands must be decontaminated in order to prevent the cross-transmission of microorganisms to other susceptible sites in that individual or to other patients.

In the weeks following his hospitalization, there were conversations in hospital around the U.S. as to the safety and ethical considerations for more invasive and riskier medical interventions during the treatment of a patient with such an infectious disease. Medical interventions like invasive surgery, dialysis, insertion of central lines, ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or even labor and delivery, all carry inherent risks for the staff performing them. The outbreaks of SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and Ebola virus disease all challenged PPE and isolation recommendations, requiring changes to protect healthcare workers and visitors during treatment, especially those interventions that generate aerosols. These outbreaks have taught vital lessons regarding the life-saving capabilities of modern medicine and technology, but also reveal a lack of preparedness consideration for medical interventions in patients with such severe and uncommon diseases.

This is even more important in the case of MERS-CoV as there were multiple healthcare associated outbreaks and healthcare workers were at an increased risk of infection [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Thus, we developed this activity to train specific healthcare workers in the process of triaging and obtaining nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected patients. The process provides a venue to limit the exposure of healthcare workers and to optimize the skills of selected group to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs. The implemented strategy helps in minimizing the risk of transmission of the MERS virus and serves as an early detec-tion method. Early detection was facilitated by effective triage at entrances, cohorting of patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and awareness of the MERS-CoV case definition. The case definition was distributed in a pocket size card to facilitate a quick reference. Adequate triage, isolating all suspected cases and managing them with appropriate infection control precautions aid in the prevention of nosocomial spread of MERS-CoV. The initial targeted groups were healthcare workers at the first patients encounter. Multiple outbreaks had occurred in emergency rooms [6, [19] [20] [21] [22] highlighting the importance of having healthcare workers working in these areas as the primary focus of education and training. Having a dedicated staff who were trained and well informed about the virus, its transmission and techniques and processes of infection control had a great positive impact on alleviating anxiety and fear. It was shown that adherence to infection control measures reduced MERS-CoV transmission [23] . During the SARS outbreak, intensive training of staff for the use of personal protective equipment and infection-control procedures were important components of the control strategies [24] . We believe that such a program of education and training would alleviate negative attitudes of staff towards providing care for patients with MERS-CoV or SARS [25] . We specifically designed the described program to train healthcare workers as it was noted that staff who had <2 h of infection control training had a higher risk of SARS [26] .",27.384168688824886,14.106788776844631

In Saudi Arabia recent significant hospital outbreaks, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have resulted from lack of, or breakdown in, infection prevention and control procedures. This study was designed to assess attitudes to, and awareness of, infection prevention and control policies and guidelines among healthcare workers of different professions and institution types in Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire was administered to 607 healthcare workers including physicians (n = 133), nurses (n = 162), laboratory staff (n = 233) and other staff (n = 79) in government hospitals, private hospitals and poly clinics. Results were compared using Chi square analysis according to profession type, institution type, age group and nationality (Saudi or non-Saudi) to assess variability. Responses suggested that there are relatively high levels of uncertainty among healthcare workers across a range of infection prevention and control issues, including institution-specific issues, surveillance and reporting standards, and readiness and competence to implement policies and respond to outbreaks. There was evidence to suggest that staff in private hospitals and nurses were more confident than other staff types. Carelessness of healthcare workers was the top-cited factor contributing to causes of outbreaks (65.07% of total group), and hospital infrastructure and design was the top-cited factor contributing to spread of infection in the hospital (54.20%), followed closely by lack and shortage of staff (53.71%) and no infection control training program (51.73%). An electronic surveillance system was considered the most effective by staff (81.22%). We have identified areas of concern among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia on infection prevention and control which vary between institutions and among different professions.

The effective functioning of N95 respirators requires a seal between the mask and the face of the wearer. Variation in face size and shape and different respirator designs mean that a proper fit is only possible in a minority of healthcare workers for any particular mask. Winter et al. reported that, for any one of three widely used respirators, a satisfactory fit could be achieved by fewer than half of the healthcare workers tested, and for 28% of the participants none of the masks gave a satisfactory fit. 29 Fit-testing is a laborious task, taking around 30 min to do properly and comprises qualitative fit-testing (testing whether the respirator-wearing healthcare worker can taste an intensely bitter or sweet substance sprayed into the ambient air around the outside of the mask) or quantitative fit testing (measuring the ratio of particles in the air inside and outside the breathing zone when wearing the respirator). Attempts have been made to circumvent the requirement for fit testing, and it has been suggested that self-testing for a seal by the respirator wearer (see http://youtu.be/pGXiUyAoEd8a for a video demonstration) is a sufficient substitute for fit-testing. However, self-checking for a seal has been demonstrated to be a highly unreliable technique in two separate studies so that full fit-testing remains a necessary preliminary requirement before respirators can be used in the healthcare setting. 30, 31 Operationally, this presents significant challenges to organizations with many healthcare workers who require fit-testing. Chakladar et al. pointed out that, in addition to the routine need for repeat testing over time to ensure that changes in weight or facial hair have not compromised a good fit, movements of healthcare workers between organizations using different makes of respirators would necessitate additional repeat fittesting. 32 Fit-testing is likely to remain problematic to healthcare organizations for the foreseeable future. In addition to the requirement for fit-testing, 'fit-checking' is also required each time the respirator is donned to ensure there are no air leaks. 33 Finding a respirator that fits a healthcare worker is not the only challenge. Many healthcare workers find that respirators are uncomfortably hot and interfere with breathing and communication. 34 Female healthcare workers were found to be more likely to complain than males. 35 However, objective studies of the impact of respirators on performance and communication show few significant effects, although hearing clarity was impaired in users of PAPRs. 36e38 Physiological measurements during simulations of clinical workloads in subjects wearing N95 respirators recorded some deviation from normal values in transcutaneously measured carbon dioxide levels, possibly linked to the measured increases and decreases in respirator dead space of carbon dioxide and oxygen levels respectively. 39 The possible consequences of these changes are unknown, although probably clinically insignificant.",29.246518162092812,14.568955800454255

Conflicting data from studies with poor design and/or low compliance does not constitute evidence against contact precautions; rather, these data are inconclusive. Whereas the study that performed best on our quality score found no significance between contact precautions and not isolating patients, this study did not consistently assess intervention compliance in the various study phases. 31 The included study that showed a difference in MDRO transmission with use of contact precautions did not report compliance rates and could not be assessed for quality on any of the other bias and confounding items of the quality assessment tool. 32 Inconsistencies and absences in compliance monitoring and reporting make it impossible to tell whether protocols were completed as intended, threatening the internal validity of these studies. 35 The CDC recently faced similar difficulty interpreting health outcomes after two healthcare workers were infected with Ebola virus in Texas, as it was unclear whether transmission had been due to inadequate isolation precaution protocols or to a protocol breach. 38 In practice, healthcare facilities should be regularly monitoring compliance, and investigating potential lapses when cross-transmission is documented, to potentially resolve systems-based inefficiencies. It is also important for researchers to monitor and report compliance to understand what effectiveness level can be reasonably expected in practice where compliance may be lower than in clinical studies. Given the quality of evidence presented here, it may be advisable that healthcare workers and administrators continue to devote focus and resources to improve components of contact precautions and other infection prevention techniques with strong effectiveness evidence, such as hand hygiene technique and compliance. 3",26.069755354057442,14.416863121078155

Sax and Clack [44••] noted that mental models are ""internal images, gathered through experience and observations to collectively form an internal representation of the individual's understanding of the world . . . ."". People use mental models as they interpret new observations and make predictions. However, mental models may not be complete or accurate representations of reality and, thus, might prevent people, including healthcare workers, from implementing beneficial practices.

Given that microbial pathogens and the effect of hand hygiene on microbial counts are not visible to the eye and the contamination event and a related HAI are separated in time, healthcare workers may have difficulty creating correct mental models about HAI and preventive measures. Thus, Sax and Clack [44••] recommended creating educational experiences that help healthcare workers ""see"" the invisible, such as simulations with fluorescent markers to demonstrate how healthcare workers' hands and clothes become contaminated during patient care, and creating policies, such as the WHO's 5 moments for hand hygiene, that enable healthcare workers to know exactly when a specific behavior is required.

Moreover, several groups have found that healthcare workers' workload affects their hand hygiene compliance [4, 5, 6, 7•] . Lee et al.

Pandemic infection control and prevention efforts in the healthcare setting, including guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment, produced vigorous debate regarding the quality of the scientific evidence on which the recommendations were based. 64 As an example, the WHO recommended surgical masks be worn by healthcare workers for care of patients with suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza, reserving N95 respirators with 0.3particle filtering capacity, for high-risk aerosol-generating procedures. 65 In contract, CDC recommended fit-tested N95 respirator use by all healthcare workers with close contact with suspected 2009 H1N1 cases. 66 The divergent recommendations were based on very limited evidence showing superior effectiveness of the N95 mask over surgical masks for protection against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 67, 68 A recent report found effectiveness of surgical masks and N95 respirators in seasonal influenza prevention to be similar in a study of 446 nurses working in emergency departments and hospital units in 8 tertiary care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, although healthcare worker infection rates were surprisingly high in both groups (23.6% and 22.9%, respectively). 69 Given the limitations of the evidence, cost and availability of the N95 masks drove infection prevention decisions in many healthcare systems. The effective bundling of interventions that include hand hygiene, masks, gowns and gloves has been shown to be highly effective in reducing respiratory virus transmission in a healthcare setting. 67",21.71276880232064,12.236450103170164

Although we failed to isolate viable virus by cell culture (Table 3) , it is noteworthy that viral RNA was detected on the entrance to air-ventilating equipment in 1 room, suggesting the potential existence of airborne-viral particles. Because our study included small number of patients (4 patients) in their late clinical phase, to confirm the airborne transmission of MERS-CoV, more case studies and additional well-designed experimental studies will be needed. Taken together, our data demonstrate that environmental contamination by patients and healthcare workers commonly occurs in airborne infection isolation rooms of MERS patients and viable virus can be shed through respiratory sputum for as long as 25 days after disease onset. Frequent and thorough environmental cleaning and disinfection are therefore critical to reduce spread of this highly contagious virus, especially in the hospital setting.

In addition, during large MERS outbreaks, where hastily assembled anterooms may not be equipped with sinks for proper hand washing, double gloving may help to avoid spread by contact. Furthermore, because PPE may be contaminated by MERS-CoV during patient care, there is a need for more careful and comprehensive procedures for putting on and removing PPE and respirators, including double gloving, in order to improve infection control. To this end, mirrors placed in anterooms can assist healthcare workers in checking their PPE status before entering patient rooms and during removal of PPE to avoid contamination.

Although no studies have addressed the safety and effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis, this should be considered in situations in which healthcare workers are exposed during aerosol-generating procedures or when there is exposure to a high viral load (as in laboratory accidents). These are the circumstances where the risk of transmission is the highest during epidemic and post-epidemic periods. Intranasal interferons have been used with some success in the prevention of experimental coronavirus and rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infections, and this mode of chemoprophylaxis warrants further studies for SARS-CoV. 39, 40 The use of convalescent plasma is another option for prophylaxis, although this has not been tested clinically. Intranasal or systemic interferon and convalescent plasma for prophylaxis should be considered in the face of a new outbreak because both these agents are relatively safe. The major caution in the use of antibodies for immunoprophylaxis is the possible enhancement of viral infectivity by the antibodies, a situation that has occurred in feline coronaviruses. 41 Active immunization against SARS-CoV has been attempted by a number of approaches, including the use of inactivated whole viruses, recombinant protein fragments and subunits, DNA vaccines and viral vectors carrying the target proteins. 3 Neutralizing antibodies against the S1 is the main correlate with immunity. Protective efficacy of the candidate vaccines is mainly studied in animals so far, and only few vaccines have entered Phase 1 human trials. 42 SARS-CoV is not unduly resistant to chemical disinfectants (such as alcohols, sodium hypochlorite and povidone-iodine) and heat (such as 568C for 60 min or 608C for 30 min), but can survive in faecal and respiratory specimens for over 7 days at room temperature.

The first batch of H1N1 vaccine is expected to be available by the end of 2009 or early 2010. 9 More than 30 governments have placed their orders. 9 For example, Hong Kong has decided to buy five million doses for its population of seven million, and the UK Department of Health has ordered 130 million doses of vaccine for its population of 61 million. However, healthcare workers' acceptance of the H5N1 and H1N1 vaccines is unknown.

Such uncertainty and unpredictability of pandemic outbreak of infectious disease from its clinical presentation, infectious causes, epidemiological features, fast transmission pattern, seriousness of public health impact, novelty, scale, implication for international public health, and underprepared health facilities to address the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 have considerably high potential for psychological fear contagion as well and often result in prevalent multitude of psychological problems such as fear, anxiety, stigma, prejudice, marginalization towards the disease and its relation of all people ranging from healthy to at-risk individuals to care-workers (Mak et al., 2010) . Mass quarantine could cause a sense of collective hysteria, fear, and anxiety in health workers working in hospitals, inpatient and outpatient care, large tertiary care centers, community based hospitals, primary care settings, nursing homes, assisted living facilities and all isolation units. The medical health-care workers who are exposed and in direct contact with the confirmed and suspected coronavirus cases are vulnerable to both high risk infection and mental health problemsworried, scared, experiencing bereavement and trauma. With the advent of COVID-19 in Pakistan, medical workers have been under physical and psychological pressure including high risk of infection, inadequate equipment for safety from contagion, isolation, exhaustion, and lack of contact with family. The severity is causing further mental health problems which not only effect medical workers' decision making ability but could also have long term detrimental effect on their overall well-being. The unremitting stress medical health-care workers is experiencing could trigger psychological issues of anxiety, fear, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychological distress, stigma and avoidance of contact, depressive tendencies, sleep disturbances, helplessness, interpersonal social isolation from family social support and concern regarding contagion exposure to their friends and family. The sudden role reversal from a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f healthcare provider to the COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient potentially lead to sense of frustration, helplessness, and adjustment challenges in healthcare professionals. Fear of labeling, stigmatization and discrimination potentially impede healthcare workers intent to seek counselling and psychotherapeutic interventions (Zheng, 2020) .

Forty-six published H5N1 seroprevalence studies of various exposure categories (household contacts, healthcare workers, poultry workers, and so on) show generally low H5N1 seroprevalence (mean, 1.7% of 21,435 persons examined in all 46 studies combined (a bibliography of these studies is available from the authors on request)). Given intense poultry and other exposures in many study areas, these low rates at first seem perplexing, especially when compared to the much higher seroprevalence rates in humans for other avian influenza viruses such as H9N2 (ref. 56) . When such information is considered in light of statistically significant clustering of non-humantransmitted (that is, presumably avian-acquired) household cases in genetically related versus unrelated persons 57,58 , a reasonable explanation seems to us to be that H5N1 is so poorly adapted to humans that exposure does not normally lead to infection or even the development of a detectable immune response 57, 59 , except in persons with specific but undefined genetic susceptibilities, many of whom become cases [60] [61] [62] .

The risk of FHF in returned travelers is low. Ten cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever were reported from 1967 to 2012, and all patients had a travel history to Africa. 175 Cases of imported EVD (excluding the nonpathogenic REBOV) were described in South Africa in 1996 (ZEBOV) and in Switzerland in 1994 (TAFV). 176 Other causes of fever in such settings must be excluded by appropriate laboratory investigations. These include (depending on the itinerary and exposure history) other causes of fever with or without hemorrhagic presentations such as meningococcal infections, severe sepsis due to other bacterial infections (including rare infections such as anthrax and plague as guided by the clinical picture and exposure history), leptospirosis, typhoid and other causes of enteric fever, rickettsioses, malaria, trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis, dengue fever, and yellow fever. In particular, malaria (which is a very common treatable cause of fever in returned travelers and is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa) must be excluded by appropriate testing. Depending on the travel destination, other causes of viral hemorrhagic fever have to be considered such as Lassa fever, Hantavirus infection, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever. The travel history should also include human contacts with sick individuals in the community (e.g., attending local funerals) or in healthcare facilities (as in the case of volunteer workers). 84 Another important exposure history is interaction with bats and other wild animals (especially primates). For example, a history of spelunking has resulted in FHF among local citizens and foreign visitors. Cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever have occurred after exposure of visitors to bats in caves in Kenya and Uganda. 177, 178 When FHF is suspected based on travel and/or exposure histories, pre-emptive isolation is essential to minimize the risk of subsequent interpersonal spread, until the diagnosis is excluded. The routes of transmission of filoviruses are well documented. Transmission can be interrupted, provided that proper infection control and public health measures are implemented. Detailed infection control guidelines on caring for patients with FHF have been published. 57,179e182 In essence, the principles of isolation and use of personal protective equipment are not significantly different from standard precautions and transmissionbased precautions (i.e., contact, droplet, and airborne) that are universally practiced in healthcare facilities. However, numerous studies and reviews have confirmed that the compliance with the choice and use of personal protective equipment among healthcare workers are almost always suboptimal. 183e185 Essential factors that ensure the optimal implementation of infection control protocols are adequate training of healthcare workers on isolation procedures and on the appropriate use of personal protective equipment, preferably by interactive training with clear instructions; adequate manpower and organizational support; and the availability of timely and adequate guidance and support. 186e188 Such training should not be limited to staff working in clinical areas; it must also include other healthcare workers such as laboratory workers and paramedical personnel. The key elements of infection control consist of patient placement (e.g., isolation facilities), strict adherence to hand hygiene (e.g., the WHO's ""five moments for hand hygiene""), proper use of personal protective equipment such as gloves (e.g., double gloves in special circumstances), waterproof gowns, respiratory protection (e.g., surgical masks, respirators during aerosol-generating procedures), eye protection, rubber boots, and safe handling of sharp objects. 55 Support staff engaged in environmental disinfection, funerals, and burial services must also be adequately trained on the proper use of personal protective equipment and chemical disinfectants, and on the handling of human remains to ensure adequate disinfection and minimize the risk of accidental exposure to the virus. 55, 189, 190 Conclusion Filoviral hemorrhagic fevers are uncommon, but they pose real clinical and public health threats to countries outside endemic areas. The routes of transmission, clinical manifestations, and infection control measures are well documented. Prevention of secondary transmission is possible, provided that cases are promptly identified, and standard isolation and precautionary measures are strictly followed. As in cases of pandemic influenza or other epidemic-prone infections, a preparedness plan is essential to cope with the importation of the diseases and limit their subsequent spread. To minimize the risk of disease importation, it is essential to have a concerted program to engage VFRs and other at-risk travelers by community health education and advisories. The current EVD outbreak provides an opportunity to evaluate new therapeutic and prophylactic strategies, whereas their actual value of these strategies in controlling the current and future epidemics require detailed clinical evaluations.",17.362288445399173,10.413064552901275

Live oral polio vaccine, which is no longer administered in the United States, is an absolute contraindication for people taking care of this high-risk population. However, data suggests that measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), varicella zoster, and herpes zoster vaccines can be safely provided to healthcare workers and household contacts [25] . If healthcare personnel develop a rash that cannot be covered within the first 42 days following receipt of the varicella vaccine, they should avoid any contact with immunocompromised patients until all rash has crusted to avoid the potential risk of transmitting vaccine strain varicella to patients [25] . Infants living in households with persons who are immunocompromised including PHO and HSCT patients may be safely immunized against rotavirus; it is recommended, however, that immunocompromised persons avoid contact with the infant's diapers/stool for 4 weeks following vaccination to minimize risk of acquiring vaccine strain rotavirus infection [26] . An inactivated influenza vaccine is preferred for personnel taking care of immunocompromised children as opposed to live attenuated influenza vaccine [25] . Vaccination against other non-viral pathogens (such as pneumococcus or pertussis) by family members is another important method to minimize the risk of serious infection in PHO patients.",20.005507357774636,13.097344764819205

What principle(s) should determine allocation of resources under such circumstances, and who, if anyone, should receive priority? Resources might, for example, be allocated by lottery or on a first come, first served basis. Or allocation decisions might aim to save the most lives, to treat those who are 'worst-off', to treat those who are most likely to recover, or to treat those who are most socially productive. 19 The Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza gives vaccine priority 'first to people at high risk of exposure to the virus and providing essential services, then to people most vulnerable to severe illness from infection'. 20 During the maintenance phase of a pandemic, healthcare workers at high risk of exposure would receive antivirals (for prophylactic purposes) continuously. It is estimated that this would consume 65% of (2006) stockpiles in just 12 weeks. 20 There are numerous reasons for thinking that healthcare workers should be prioritized in the allocation of scarce medical resources in the event of a pandemic. As indicated above, this may compensate them for providing services under risky conditions and/or for harms suffered as a result. Prioritizing healthcare workers might also be justified on the grounds of social utility, i.e. because healthy healthcare workers will be needed in order to fight a pandemic. It is true that many others, including politicians and bus drivers, also play important social roles, but it would be impractical to prioritize each according to the importance of his/her social function. 21 However, if it is practical and appropriate to prioritize those who play special roles regarding the pandemic emergency under consideration, in addition to healthcare workers, we might aim to prioritize 'pandemic responders' more generally. Grave diggers, for example, would play an especially important role, and those familiar with the history of the 1918 pandemic (when there was a serious shortage of such people) would recognize reasons for keeping them healthy too.",37.95679159197486,17.26141745578892

The duty in question is also often explicitly stated in health professions' codes of conduct. It is sometimes additionally argued that the duty is established via social contract.

But what if the risk of death for the healthcare worker was 50%, 20%, 10% or 1%? For what X should a healthcare worker be expected to treat, so long as the risk of death for the healthcare worker is less than X%? The answer presumably depends on the expected effectiveness of treatment. 16 The more likely that treatment would save the patient's life, the greater the level of risk that healthcare workers should be expected to face to provide treatment (which is not to say that healthcare workers should be expected to provide treatment even when the risks are especially high).

To summarize our results in words, Fgl2(+158T/*) is a risk variant, unless combined with CXCL10(−938AA) genotype. CXCL10(−938AA) assumes a protective role whenever it appears, but it appears rarely and only jointly with either Fgl2(+158T/*) or HO-1(−497A/*). All results pertaining to HO-1(−497A/*), either by it self or jointly with other genotypes, indicate that its association with SARS susceptibility is very weak one, if indeed such an association exists. Larger genetic data set is needed to further ascertain its validity, either using this modeling approach or more traditional statistical analysis which might be more suitable for elucidating the issue at hand, provided a sufficiently large data set is available. Moreover, our study is mainly observational, where no control group who did not get infected with SARS is considered and other likely risk factors have not been controlled for. Since these other factors could have influenced the patient outcomes as well as key rates in our model such as death, incident, and recovery rates, it might have had an effect on our results. In this paper, we have been conservative in reporting statistically significant difference in susceptibility only when there are no overlapping confidence intervals. Note also that this study does not rule out the possibility that other genes may also be associated with susceptibility to SARS. The model does not consider heterogeneity in contacts, nor do we assign separate compartments for subpopulations such as the healthcare workers. Nosocomial infection played a major role in the SARS outbreak in Taiwan with approximately 80% of the infections occurred in hospitals, out of which roughly 30% were healthcare workers (Ho and Su, 2004) . However, since our gene data consists of only 100 cases including 39 healthcare workers, a further division into smaller subgroups of a handful of individuals would render the estimation results highly unreliable. There also may be other unknown factors of social, biological, or environmental nature, which influence SARS susceptibility but are not considered here.",20.408351275130094,10.655113306126388

The source patient's blood is collected to check for the presence of HIV, HBV, and HCV. If the status of bloodborne viruses of the source patient is positive or unknown, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be offered according to current guidelines (Kuhar et al., 2013 ). The exposed healthcare worker will be closely followed up for counseling, baseline, and HIV testing and monitored for drug toxicity. If a newer fourth-generation combination HIV p24 antigen-HIV antibody test is utilized for follow-up HIV testing, HIV testing may be concluded 4 months after exposure. Otherwise, follow-up HIV testing is performed 6 months after the exposure (Kuhar et al., 2013) . For HBV, PEP with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and/or HBV vaccination should be considered for occupational exposures after evaluation of the HBsAg status of the source and the vaccination and vaccine-response status of the exposed person (2001) . For HCV, PEP is not currently recommended. However, an open-label pilot trial was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and acceptance of peginterferon alfa-2b as PEP. Among 213 healthcare workers exposed to an HCV antibody-positive source, 51 HCWs enrolled in the study and 44 (86%) elected to undergo peginterferon alfa-2b as the study group. Seven subjects elected not to undergo PEP were treated as the control group. In this pilot study, peginterferon alfa-2b was proved to be safe without serious adverse side effects. However, the lack of HCV transmission Scientists and personnel handling bats Rural residents with contact with bats (organ transplantation) Dietzschold and Koprowski (2004) and Kusne and Smilack (2005) in both the study and control groups did not support the routine use of PEP in healthcare workers after HCV exposure (Corey et al., 2009) . It is likely that the new polymerase and protease inhibitors used in the treatment of HCV infection will result in new strategies for PEP of HCV exposures. Blood-borne viruses can also be transmitted from healthcare workers to patients, especially during exposure-prone procedures in dental and cardiothoracic operations. The most well-known example involved an HIV-positive dentist working in Florida, the United States, who infected five of his patients after performing invasive dental procedures on them . Sequencing of the HIV proviral envelope gene showed that the viruses infecting the dentist and the five patients were closely related . However, the overall risk for transmission of HIV from a healthcare worker to a patient is very small. In a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of 22 171 patients being cared by 51 HIV-positive healthcare workers, 113 (0.5%) patients became HIV-positive. Epidemiological investigation did not implicate healthcare workers as the source of infection in any of these patients (Robert et al., 1995) . In contrast, transmission of HBV and HCV from healthcare workers to patients was more frequently documented. Between August 1991 and July 1992, 19 of 144 (13%) patients who were operated on by a thoracic surgeon with acute HBV infection became HBV-infected. Sequencing of 160 bases in the core region of HBV showed an indistinguishable pattern among the strains of the surgeon and nine infected patients (Harpaz et al., 1996) . Subsequently, numerous healthcare worker-to-patient transmissions of HBV and HCV were reported. Among all these reported cases, the viral loads of the index healthcare workers were more than 10 6 genome copies per milliliter (Buster et al., 2003; Gunson et al., 2003) . In this connection, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) issued a guideline for the management of healthcare workers who are infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV to impose restriction on different categories of exposure-prone procedures according to the viral load (Henderson et al., 2010) .",23.545192838360737,12.46193652771657

Immunization of healthcare workers involved with at-risk patients is also recommended. However, there is no direct evidence that influenza immunization of healthcare workers or patients will directly reduce the incidence of HAP, although one study 28 found evidence to suggest that influenza immunization prevents pneumonia in elderly patients. The same study reported that a failure to immunize healthcare workers against influenza was associated with an increased mortality from 'influenza like illness' in elderly patients.

Some healthcare workers died from SARS, and some spread the disease to their families. 55 Healthcare workers have moral obligations to their families, and institutions should make it possible for them to care for patients without abandoning their responsibility to their families or risking their families' lives. Institutions should, for example, assist with child care and provide temporary living quarters to reduce the risk of disease transmission to family members and the associated anxiety and moral distress. 62 Institutions, as well as public health agencies, may also consider additional acts of reciprocity toward healthcare workers who fulfill their duty to treat, such as insurance to protect them and their families should they become ill or die as a result of caring for Ebola-infected patients. Ultimately, however emergency nurses and physicians care for the sick primarily out of personal moral obligation; financial incentives alone are not likely to increase the likelihood that they will discharge their duty under epidemic conditions. 63 The protections that institutions and society provide healthcare workers-for themselves and their families-are ethically required. Just as emergency nurses and physicians may not generally opt out of caring for the sick, institutions and communities may not opt out of caring for healthcare professionals and their families. In sum, the duty to treat patients with infectious diseases, including Ebola, is both a legal responsibility and an ethical obligation of the healthcare professions.

The latter issue has been a source of some controversy in preparedness strategies, as it is unclear whether hospitals would retain control over existing antiviral stockpiles in the event of a pandemicrelated emergency. A recent study suggests that hospitals should consider stockpiling neuraminidase inhibitors for prophylaxis and treatment of healthcare workers (Cinti et al., 2005) . While the proposed strategy focuses primarily on the treatment of ill healthcare workers, it emphasizes targeted prophylaxis of front-line healthcare providers. The outcome of this strategy may be potentially significant in mitigating pandemic burden, and two recent studies have addressed this effect through development of population dynamical models of influenza transmission (Gardam et al., 2007; Lee and Chen, 2007) . Central to these models is the provision of antiviral treatment to the general population, by taking into account the availability of healthcare workers that is influenced by their reduced susceptibility to infection due to the protective efficacy of prophylaxis. Despite several limitations, these modeling efforts demonstrate that antiviral prophylaxis can substantially decrease absenteeism rates among key health personnel, and significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in the general population. However, both studies indicate that policy effectiveness depends critically on adequacy of the antiviral drug supply and the timely implementation of treatment and prophylaxis strategies. Although several countries have followed guidelines issued by the WHO for formulating national preparedness strategies ( > Figure 82-1) , there remain discrepancies in planning for antiviral use, distribution, and priorities for treatment and prophylaxis. Most responding plans consider immediate treatment of ill individuals upon diagnosis as a more efficient approach to the use of drug stockpiles, and give priority to healthcare workers, essential and public safety staff, and those who are at risk of severe complications or death. However, antiviral prophylaxis has been a matter of ongoing debate for both logistical concerns and clinical-epidemiological consequences of viral evolution and transmission (Democratis et al., 2006; Lipsitch et al., 2007; Regoes and Bonhoeffer, 2006) . > Figure 82 administrative frameworks for prophylaxis strategies that can effectively protect the healthcare workforce in the face of infectious disease threats (Cinti et al., 2005; Toner and Waldhorn, 2006; Xiong et al., 2007) , precise planning for antiviral use is hindered by several unknownsin particular, the transmissibility of the pandemic strain, effectiveness of drugs, and the impact of other curtailing measures. There is also much uncertainty about how a novel influenza strain would affect different populations with distinctly different mobility patterns, healthcare expenditures, and economic structures. The nature of the next influenza pandemic cannot be predicted with certainty, but the high mortality rates among younger adults in past pandemics compel us to consider maximizing the protection of healthcare workers by using available means of reducing disease transmission.",36.10689247528965,16.262467107257137

Figure 82 -2 Prophylactic use of antiviral drugs in national pandemic plans. Among fifty-one published contingency plans for pandemic responses (FAO United Nations, 2008; Straetemans et al., 2007; WHO, 2008) , healthcare workers are identified as the priority group for pre-exposure (long-term) prophylaxis in 17 national plans (Australia, Bahrain, Republic of Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Montenegro, Nicaragua, Norway, Republic of Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland, Timor Leste, United States), and for post-exposure prophylaxis in eight plans (Austria, Cuba, Ireland, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Portugal, Singapore). Essential service personnel are given priority for long-term prophylaxis in seven plans (Republic of Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Greece, Nicaragua, Norway, Sweden), and for post-exposure prophylaxis in six plans (Australia, Montenegro, Philippines, Portugal, Republic of Serbia, Singapore). A number of these plans indicate that the decision on prophylactic use of drugs may be influenced by the availability of vaccines and the size of antiviral stockpiles, in addition to the severity of the pandemic strain. Twenty-five national plans (Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Republic of Estonia, Finland, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Luxemburg, Nauru, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nouvelle-Calé donie, Palau, Poland, Rwanda, Slovak Republic, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, United Kingdom, West Bank/Gaza) indicate no specific strategy for prophylaxis of healthcare workers or essential service personnel.

Zombie Pop Culture to Improve Infection Prevention and Control Practices,"Infection prevention and control is a key aspect of all undergraduate health professions and the delivery of patient care. It contributes to both patient and healthcare worker safety and is recognised as a global priority by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its member states, including Australia, with the First Global Patient Safety Challenge, Clean Care is Safer Care, launched in 2005. 4 An important part of this initiative is the education and training of healthcare workers in infection prevention and control. Infection prevention and control education is, however, notoriously 'vanilla,' in the sense that it mainly consists of annual staff training, inservice programmes, posters, reporting of audit results and online learning. Generally speaking, it is considered a chore and little attention is paid by healthcare workers. Allen, Currey and Considine state that 'Assessment must not be undertaken simply for the purpose of assessment. When used, assessment must contribute to the learning experience-i.e. be conducted for and of learning,' which is often not the case in practice where staff undertake annual competencies, increasingly in an online format, purely to meet an administrative requirement. 5 It is for this reason perhaps that there are approximately 200,000 healthcare associated infections reported each year from Australian health facilities, which makes them the most common complication for patients. 6 Even with these statistics well known, the situation remains that standard and transmission-based precautions are still not well complied with by healthcare workers. 7 The literature, and healthcare history abounds with examples of how infection prevention and control is not done, of which the most recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa and the percolating Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERs) are examples. 8 Before that, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the highly pathogenic avian influenzas, followed similar patterns. All of these infectious diseases have been amplified in the healthcare setting, primarily because of poor everyday infection prevention and control practice, and poor identification of infectious diseases.

However, the extent to which vaccination is successful depends largely on the antigenic match between the vaccine composition strains and the circulating viral strains (Bridges et al., 2000) . The impact of vaccines on a pandemic can potentially be very significant, yet it remains to be proven in practice. While efforts are being made to shorten the delay in vaccine availability, retarding the progression of the first pandemic wave is essential for preventing excessive deaths and social disadvantages. Without a pandemic strain vaccine, protection mechanisms are limited to antiviral drugs and infection control practices. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions in its updated influenza pandemic plan, to protect healthcare workers while providing care (WHO Writing Group, 2006) . This update emphasizes the maintenance of capability/capacity for infection control and staff competency in use of personal protective equipment, such as gowns, gloves, and surgical masks. Although the use of such equipment may decrease the risk of transmission, the sheer number of encounters with infectious patients over the course of a working day would likely still result in disease transmission. Even with excellent infection control precautions, attack rates of greater than 10% are likely to occur among healthcare workers in the absence of vaccination (Salgado et al., 2002) . Additionally, evidence suggests that infected individuals with developing or weakened immune systems (such as infants, elderly, and immunocompromised subjects) may suffer from prolonged illnesses and shed virus for several weeks, which makes transmission of the disease even more difficult to control in healthcare facilities and the community (Salgado et al., 2002) . In a pandemic scenario, this would mean that a large part of the healthcare system, and particularly healthcare workers, will be at risk of repeated exposure.

Even in non-pandemic times, healthcare systems in many parts of the world are stretched in meeting the need for regular services. While the demand for healthcare services will substantially increase during a pandemic, health resources will be more quickly depleted and there may be fewer healthcare workers available. Assuming a viral strain with 25-35% clinical attack rate over the estimated 8-12 weeks of a pandemic wave, a sizable portion of healthcare workers may become infected during the early stages of disease outbreaks (Gardam et al., 2007; Lee and Chen, 2007) . The consequence is clear: a critical shortage of health personnel and care providers. While healthcare organizations often face staff-shortage during a natural disaster, the healthcare system may experience much higher absenteeism rates in the event of a pandemic. Considering the potentially reduced capacity of the healthcare system, and the lack of appropriate resources that is likely to arise, health professionals may be called upon to assume responsibilities outside their normal scope of practice. Such responsibilities may involve further exposure to the disease, and require strict adherence to infection control practices. In such circumstances, it is vital to ensure that healthcare workers are adequately protected and barriers to their participation are eliminated, especially in the presence of other potentially competing obligations that need to be addressed. The diversity among healthcare workers and facilities makes preparation and response to a pandemic especially challenging. Healthcare facilities are magnets for individuals with influenza-related illness, and are at high risk of disruption during a pandemic, primarily due to hospital outbreaks of influenza that affect both patients and staff (Salgado et al., 2002) . Such outbreaks can have serious consequences for a sustainable healthcare response: staff shortages can result or be exacerbated; admission maybe curtailed; and increased costs may be incurred. Published studies clearly demonstrate these outcomes (Horcajada et al., 2003; Lundstrom et al., 2002; Malavaud et al., 2001; Munoz et al., 1999; Sartor et al., 2002; Stott et al., 2002) , and therefore preventing > nosocomial spread of influenza is crucial for mitigating the impact of a pandemic on the population. While responding to the care of influenza patients, other health needs will continue and cannot be ignored during pandemic phases. Conventional wisdom considers access to inpatient and outpatient care to be central to any pandemic response. Were modern healthcare resources unavailable, ill individuals would not be able to access antiviral drugs, antibiotics, oxygen therapy, intravenous therapy, intensive care, and other therapies. These modern options are essentially irrelevant without personnel, and their application requires a competent healthcare workforce, professional experience, and practice in order to minimize possible unintended health consequences.",23.82997381681877,11.371137702446552

Overall, our results indicated that most of medical residents believed their job put them at considerable risk of exposure and were afraid of contracting MERS; however, they also believed that it was part of their professional duty to care for MERS patients and accepted this risk of infection. Participants were also not willing to change their jobs due to the risk of exposure to MERS and they were confident that the hospitals would look after them if they were infected. These results generally accord with 2 recently published studies conducted in KSA among health care workers (HCWs), which sought to examine their attitudes and concerns regarding the emerging outbreak of MERS-CoV. In particular, in both studies, HCWs reported that their job put them at a high risk of contracting the infection.9,10 For example, Abolfotouh et al9 reported that around 70% of surveyed participants felt at risk of contracting a MERS-CoV infection at work, although around 61% felt obligated to provide medical care for patients infected with MERS-CoV. These findings are also consistent with studies conducted in other countries dealing with different viral outbreaks that had major emotional impacts on healthcare workers.5-7 For instance, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, approximately two-thirds of healthcare workers in Toronto experienced concern for their own or their family’s health.6 In Hong Kong, 68% of participants reported a high level of stress and 57% were found to have experienced psychological distress; high stress was much more common among nurses and younger workers.6 Unsurprisingly, most medical residents at the 4 centers recognized their professional obligation to look after patients with MERS despite the potential risk to themselves. This contrasts with the findings of a previous study in Australia during the avian influenza outbreak of 2006, wherein a hospital staff absentee rate of 38% was found.11 Similar findings to the Australian study were reported in Hong Kong and Mainland China during the SARS outbreak, wherein a large number of HCWs were absent or refused to look after the infected patients.6 By contrast, in Germany, only 28% of surveyed healthcare workers agreed that it would be professionally acceptable for healthcare workers to abandon their workplace during an influenza pandemic to protect themselves and their families, whereas 52% disagreed with this statement.12 We found that older residents were more likely to report being afraid of infection than were younger residents. This is in contrast to Nickell et al5 study, wherein 73% of staff who were younger than 30 years of age reported being concerned about infection, compared with only 65.6% of staff who were older than 50 years Tam et al6 reported a similar finding to Nickell et al5 younger staff members were more prone to job stress during a SARS outbreak than were older staff. However, in both Tam et al6 and Nickle et al5 studies, medical doctors were a minority of participants, making up only 9% and 3% of their cohort. In contrast, Wong et al8 report no significant differences in distress among the age groups8 In line with our study, Abolfotouh et al9 reported that a greater percentage of HCWs who were older than 35 years of age reported a high level of concern about infection than did HCWs who were younger than 35 years (27% versus 23%)12 Our finding may be attributed to the fact that we included only physicians. In addition, the cultural background of our sample might have influenced our findings: older physicians tend to have families and to be supporting their loved ones. Moreover, the median age of our sample differed from that of previous studies showing that younger staff had more concerns about infection than did older staff.",19.397120322678397,10.32838200933026

The study provides data on the factors associated with uptake and the perception of healthcare workers on the at-risk groups where vaccination should be a high priority. The sample size is adequately powered. However, some limitations should be addressed. First, we evaluated the acceptability of the healthcare workers at a relatively early stage of the programme, and there exists the possibility that their opinions and perception may change overtime. In addition, the response rate of the survey was modest, and thus a biased sample might have been recruited. Hence, a major limitation of this study included the inability of the researchers to characterize the nonresponders, since the only information we have for these nonresponders was their contact methods. Nevertheless, there are no concrete, plausible explanations why the responders and nonresponders should be different with respect to their intention to accept ad hoc influenza vaccines. Furthermore, this acceptability survey captured opinions of healthcare workers but not what they would practice in reality. Hence, future cohort studies should be performed to assess the actual uptake rate when the vaccine is available for use.

Somewhat higher acceptance levels of pandemic vaccine have been reported among health care workers in France (36.5%),16 UK hospitals (63.4%),17 and frontline healthcare workers in Shropshire County's general practices (83.9%),18 but lower as shown in another local study conducted among nurses in Hong Kong (13.3%).19 The relatively low acceptance rate in Hong Kong could be related to the high proportion (83.5%) of respondents perceiving that the viral strain may be different in the coming season, which makes the additional vaccine relatively redundant and not cost-effective. Several studies have reported that safety concerns about a new vaccine20 and the difficulty to reconcile conflicting evidence about the vaccine21–23 as important barriers. Turning to the factors associated with the intention to accept the additional vaccine, the Health Belief Model (HBM) could explain the relationship between vaccine acceptability and perceived risk of contracting influenza as well as perceived severity of influenza.24 Since the efficacy, safety profile, and cost-benefit of the additional vaccine has not been fully evaluated, recommendations to encourage healthcare workers to take the vaccine will need to be further consolidated. We found that primary care physicians had a significantly higher acceptance rate than physicians of other specialties, and thus could play a key role in mobilizing colleagues working in other specialties. Our results indicate that one could invest more resources to improve acceptance among healthcare workers as the majority of them believe that influenza vaccine saves lives (86.7%) and reduces medical expenses (76.3%). This study highlighted that 80% to 90% of healthcare workers supported vaccination for high-risk patients, in contrast to low level of personal acceptance even when perceived risk of infection and severity of impact were high. This study pointed out that such discordance that may be a reasonable target for further strategies to improving vaccination campaign acceptability. Protecting healthcare workers may be an important measure to prevent in-hospital spread of infection in the face of influenza outbreak.

During the study period, our hospital infection control policy stated that adult and pediatric patients presenting with influenza-like illness should be placed in contact and droplet precautions. However, we realize that influenza-like illness may be insensitive indicator for some respiratory viral infections [15]. Nevertheless, such patients were placed in a private room, or if no private room was available, they were cohorted with patients identified to have the same respiratory virus. Despite this policy, nosocomial respiratory viral infections occurred. This most likely reflects inadequate screening of ill visitors and family or ill healthcare workers reporting for duty despite symptoms of a respiratory viral infection because these have not been stressed in recent educational efforts, and our hospital did not have a formal screening program for visitors and staff. However, based on an educational campaign and compliance monitoring, we believe that transmission of such infections in the hospital setting was less likely to be due to noncompliance with the policy, inadequate decontamination of the inanimate environment, or suboptimal hand hygiene compliance. Our hospital occupational health policy followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for mitigating risk of influenza transmission from infected healthcare workers to patients that uses fever as a determining factor for which healthcare workers should not have patient contact [16].

This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities.5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay.6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical.7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death.8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events.9

We identified itraconazole (ITZ) as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of enterovirus replication. ITZ is a well-known antifungal drug that inhibits CYP51, a cytochrome P450 required for sterol biosynthesis (Lestner and Hope, 2013). In addition, ITZ exerts anti-cancer activity by inhibiting angiogenesis – through disturbing mTOR signaling and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) trafficking – and the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway (Kim et al., 2010; Nacev et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2010). ITZ has been found to be efficacious in patients with several cancer types in multiple Phase 2 clinical studies (Antonarakis et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014; Rudin et al., 2013). We demonstrate that known targets of ITZ cannot explain the antiviral activity of ITZ. Instead, evidence is presented that OSBP and ORP4 are novel targets of ITZ and that direct binding of ITZ to OSBP – which localizes at ROs – disrupts its lipid shuttling function and accounts for the antiviral effect of ITZ.",7.870101059019287,6.4276537712304815

In some 47 places, the complete lack of PPE has resulted in healthcare workers using PPE that may have 48 variable droplet protection (1) . Shortages of PPE have significant impact among healthcare 49 workers who evaluate individuals with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 disease (1) (2) . First, 50 individuals using PPE acquired outside of the hospital may inadvertently be using PPE without 51 droplet protection resulting in inadequate protection. Second, workers without PPE will acquire 52 infections, including COVID-19, at greater rates than those with adequate PPE (3). Infected 53 healthcare workers may transmit disease to family members, worsening the pandemic (4). Third, 54 with increased COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers, the available workforce to 55 address sick patients decreases, resulting in increasing morbidity and mortality (4). There is 56 therefore a critical need to develop innovative measures to generate safe, reusable PPE. 57 Thus, we have designed and fabricated an Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, 58 Conformable (iMASC) system for aerosol-based protection with N95 material filters that can be 59 inserted and replaced as needed. To understand the ability of our mask to conform to multiple 60 face sizes and shapes, we have undertaken finite element analysis evaluating the deformability of 61 the iMASC system. Lastly, we performed a prospective clinical trial for fit testing of our mask as 62 well as qualitative assessment of the mask compared to the current N95 masks. Our goal is to 63 address the critical shortage of N95 face masks to maximally protect healthcare workers and 64 provide an enduring supply chain of N95 face masks to reduce and prevent COVID-19 65 transmission among healthcare workers and patients.
