The overall strategy would be to generate suitable stockpiles for emergency response use having previously demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of each vaccine up to Phase II trials in the target geographical regions. These products could be stored in relevant locations for each disease and, in the event of an outbreak emerging, could be deployed in a ring vaccination program similar to that employed in a Phase III trial in Guinea of the rVSV ZEBOV vaccine during the West African Ebola outbreak. 18 Such a deployment would need to be made under the provisions of policies for use of unapproved medicinal products, such as the FDA Expanded Access program, also known as ""compassionate use"", or other emergency use legislation.

The development of an optimal immune response to meet either goal is challenging due to the sophisticated mechanisms that control immune responses (15) . The process often involves multiple critical considerations, such as the selection of candidate antigens, choice of adjuvant, antigen/ vaccine design, dosage, frequency of application, duration of immunization, injection protocols, etc. (16 -18) . Immune responses are typically monitored by measuring antibody titers (the relative concentration of antigen-specific antibodies) in the blood samples collected from the immunized hosts over the course of immunization. While many commercial kits and automated systems are available, ELISA remains the most widely used method for antibody titer measurements due to its simplicity and low cost. However, these conventional assays can only partially evaluate immune responses (19, 20) , as they cannot accurately reveal data about the binding affinity, specificity, and epitope diversity of polyclonal antibodies, all of which are important for an effective immunization campaign that will lead to the generation of high quality antibody responses with distinct specificities.",32.75066471047217,11.915592156911442

Here, using the Syrian hamster/Andes virus lethal disease model, we demonstrate that another component of the immune system is not directly responsible for the HPS-like disease cause by ANDV in hamsters. The mechanism by which hantaviruses cause disease in humans and hamsters alike is not clear, and many mechanisms of disease, both immune related and virus intrinsic, have been proposed. Making this more difficult is that aspects of the immune response to hantavirus infection are likely to be important for protection and viral clearance, even as they are viewed as contributing to disease. Still, it will be necessary to continue to evaluate other immune cell types, as we seek to understand their role in contributing to disease or protection following hantavirus infection.",27.144182790540686,11.280298631616493

A non-virulent or attenuated derivative of the pathogen is used to induce a response to the bacterium itself. When used as a vaccine vehicle the bacterium expresses an antigen from another species. Most commonly, these vaccine vehicles are based on either attenuated pathogens or bacteria used in the food industry. Both classes of bacteria deliver the vaccine component to the immune system whereby immunization may benefit from the bacterium's intrinsic adjuvant. The vaccine component to be delivered can be either protein or DNA. In addition, the vaccine component may be a classical antigen but may also be allergens or therapeutics. A recent development is the use of invasive bacteria for the delivery of plasmid DNA vaccines to mammalian cells obtaining in vivo synthesis of the plasmid-encoded antigen. As such, the applications of live bacterial vaccines are extensive and has lead to more than 2000 published papers. However, only very few of the promising candidates have survived the licensing process and become registered [1] illuminating the difficulty in developing a commercial live vaccine. One typhoid vaccine (Ty21a) contains live attenuated Salmonella typhi and is administered orally either as a liquid or as acid resistant capsules. Both formulations require three doses within one week to give immunity. The other registered vaccine based on live bacteria is against cholera and is given orally as a single dose of attenuated Vibrio cholerae (CVD 103-HgR) in liquid formulation. This vaccine is used in a lower dose (5 × 10 8 live bacteria) for travellers from non-endemic regions and a one log higher dose for residents in endemic regions (5 × 10 9 live bacteria). The very few examples of live bacterial vaccines on the market may be due to lack of success in clinical trials. However, we believe that the safety of these vaccines is another issue. Indeed, prophylactic vaccines are given to healthy people and despite excellent safety record they remain targets of un-substantiated allegations by anti vaccine movements. Furthermore, future live vaccines will most likely be either targeted mutagenised or equipped with foreign antigens and therefore considered recombinant. As such, they fall into the debate on releasing genetically modified organisms into nature. The feasibility of this new vaccine strategy will therefore in particular depend on considerations of safety issues. We believe that considering safety issues alongside the scientific consideration early in vaccine development will facilitate its public acceptance and its entrance to the market. We therefore felt compelled to outline a review about live vaccines and their safety aspects. Lindberg [2] has excellently reviewed the history of live bacterial vaccines. The first use of a live bacterial vaccine was in Spain in 1884 and consisted of a subcutaneous injection of weakened Vibrio cholerae. This study was followed a few years later by field trials in India with a more efficacious V. cholerae vaccine, however still parenteral. The first live oral V. cholerae vaccine candidate did not appear until the 1980s. Later the V. cholerae strain CVD 103 Hg-R has been found to be both safe and immunogenic after a single oral dose. In 1996 a bivalent vaccine waspresented including two strains of V. cholerae called CVD 103 Hg-R and CVD 111 [3] . However, later on problems with attenuation of strain CVD 111 appeared [4] . The development of the other registered live bacterial vaccine began Hg-in the early 1970s using various live attenuated S. typhi to vaccinate against typhoid fever. One proposed strain was made streptomycin-dependent, but failed to be efficacious in freeze-dried formulation [5] . Furthermore, the strain was genetically unstable and reverted to virulence. Another S. typhi strain (Ty21a) with a defect galE gene, as well as other not defined mutations, requires an external source of galactose. This strain was extensively evaluated in several field trials and has shown excellent safety record [6] . Later, other auxotrophic strains unable to synthesise essential compounds like aromatic amino acids were developed and tested on human volunteers with variable safety and immunogenicity results [7] [8] [9] [10] . Attenuated live vaccines to prevent shigellosis have also been proposed. Both genetically engineered or selected mutants of Shigella have been tried but showed side effects in clinical trials and points to the need of additional attenuation without hampering immunogenicity [11] [12] [13] . Kotloff et al attenuated the guanine auxotrophic Shigella flexneri 2a further by deleting two genes encoding enterotoxins [14] . In a phase 1 trial this strain with inactivated enterotoxin genes was better tolerated but still immunogenic compared to the guanine auxotrophic strain that contain active entoroxins.",25.893787272263726,10.677972343187735

Indeed, the very first vaccination experiment in the Western world was Jenner's inoculation of a boy with the milder cowpox virus to protect against the deadly smallpox. Although effective the technology has safety problems associated with the risk of reversion to a virulent organism and the possibility of causing disease in immune compromised individuals. Within the last 20 years the concept of live vaccines gains renewed interest due to our increased immunological understanding and the availability of molecular techniques making the construction of safer live vaccines possible. This opens for the development of new live bacterial vaccines that can avoid the downsides of parenterally administered vaccine because it (i) mimics the route of entry of many pathogens and stimulate the mucosal immune response (ii) can be administered orally or nasally avoiding the risk associated with contaminated needles and need for a professional healthcare infra structure (iii) has a simple down stream processing.

Human-to-human transmission is common in Bangladesh and has also been documented in India. 55 Several species of pteropid fruit bats are known to be host reservoirs of NiV, with accumulating evidence that both NiV and other paramyxoviruses can circulate worldwide in bats. [54] [55] [56] The high fatality rate, direct infection from natural reservoirs, infection following amplification in susceptible domestic livestock such as pigs, documented human-to-human transmission, and the potential ability to transverse the globe, all emphasise the pandemic potential of NiV. 56 There are no clinically approved vaccines against NiV, however, one therapeutic approach (monoclonal antibody therapy) has recently completed a phase I clinical trial with results still to be reported. 57 While monoclonal antibody treatment may be efficacious in a short window post-exposure, this treatment option is not suitable for large-scale use, and as such, vaccine development is a key research focus for the prevention of NiV-mediated disease. Advantageously, there are a number of animal models of NiV infection which are used in vaccine development programs and are considered to sufficiently mirror NiV-induced pathogenesis observed in humans, e.g. the hamster, ferret and African Green Monkey (AGM) models. [58] [59] [60] While vaccine-mediated cellular immunity has been demonstrated to play a role in protection in preclinical models of NiV infection, 61 the most advanced vaccine modalities demonstrating clear efficacy across multiple animal models have primarily induced humoral immunity. A soluble glycoprotein (sG) subunit vaccine from the related henipavirus Hendra virus (HeV) is an extensively studied vaccine that can protect ferrets and AGM from experimental challenge with NiV or HeV. Primeboost regimens with adjuvanted HeV-sG subunit proteins are efficacious in stringent NiV challenge models, across a range of doses (4-100ug), and with pre-challenge neutralising antibody titres as low as 1:28. 62, 63 The HeV sG vaccine (Equivac Ò HeV) has been licensed to vaccinate horses in Australia against HeV. 64 A number of viral vectored vaccines have also been tested and show promising immunogenicity and/or efficacy against NiV-mediated disease.

The rapid development of vaccines and therapeutics that target these pathogens is therefore essential to limit their spread. Traditional empirical approaches that screen for vaccines or drugs a few candidates at a time are timeconsuming and have often proven insufficient to control many EIDs, particularly when the causative pathogens are antigenically diverse (e.g., HIV), cannot be cultivated in the laboratory (e.g., HCV), lack suitable animal models of infection (e.g., Neisseria spp.), have complex mechanisms of pathogenesis (e.g., retroviruses), and/or are controlled by mucosal or T cell-dependent immune responses rather than humoral immune responses (e.g., Shigella spp., M. tuberculosis) [3] . For many EIDs, the wealth of information emerging in the genome era has already had a significant impact on the way we approach vaccine and therapeutic development.

Furthermore, we anticipate the continual refinement and development of novel genome-based approaches as sequencing becomes faster and more affordable. Several challenges remain, however, in the identification of these targets and in the processes needed to bring a new vaccine or drug to the market. Understanding the molecular nature of epitopes, the mechanisms of action of adjuvants, and T cell and mucosal immunity are key priorities to be tackled in the coming years [3] . These issues can be addressed by improved structural studies of antigen epitopes and the compilation of databases containing information on structure, immunogenicity, and in silico B cell and T cell epitope predictions. Genome-based development of effective vaccines and therapeutics is still largely dependent on the availability of valid models to measure efficacy and protection against disease; however, the increased understanding of microbial pathogenesis that is emerging from genomics should greatly aid in this respect. Likewise, the continued development of animal models with knockout and allele-specific mutations in key components of the immune response will greatly increase understanding of the type of immune response needed to control disease and the ways in which the immune system can be programmed to protect the host against disease. Unfortunately, the stepwise series of prelicensure clinical trials (Phase I, II, and III) that are required to document the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a vaccine are still highly time-consuming and costly.

Nonetheless, additional studies are still needed before their clinical translation. While intranasal vaccination of nanoparticles generates specific IgA antibody in the URT and leads to high survival rates in animal models, there are still limited studies on non-human primates, thus making nanoparticle's fate difficult to predict in a human URT. In addition, nanoparticle vaccines are generally functionalized with specific antigen(s), which result in an immune response targeted against these antigenic determinants. Considering antigenic drifts, the growing human population that needs to be vaccinated and the different type of viruses, the cost to address all these aspects would be too prohibitive to produce affordable vaccines.

Safe and effective vaccines are important to safeguard public health. Intranasal DNA vaccination appears to be a promising non-invasive approach to provide protection against various infectious diseases. Evidence shows that intranasal DNA vaccine could elicit strong and long-lasting humoral as well as cell-mediated immune responses in many animal models. DNA vaccines are already successfully used in veterinary products for protection against infections, but their immunogenicity needs to be further enhanced to make them suitable for human use. Improving DNA delivery and formulation is one of the several strategies to enhance the immune response. Various studies have demonstrated that significant improvement of immune response that could be achieved by the employment of DNA carrier system, or to target the DNA vaccines to APCs. DNA vaccines generally have good safety profile, but the potential toxicity associated with DNA delivery systems, especially when they are used at high concentration, must not be neglected. DNA vaccines may circumvent many problems associated with conventional vaccines such as high costs of protein vaccine purification and bacterial/viral inactivated or attenuated process, the incorrect folding of antigen and viral mutation risk, thereby offering a safer alternative to benefit humans. In addition, mass manufacture of DNA vaccine is easier and faster, and DNA product is usually highly stable. Once an effective intranasal DNA vaccine delivery system is identified and optimized, a delivery technology platform could be established to allow the development of DNA vaccine formulations for different infectious diseases in the future.",36.11650179472402,14.42845237380656

Therefore, these vaccines have higher stability for administration (in particular as oral vaccines), storage, and transport. Compared with standard plasmid DNA vaccination, phage DNA vaccines have been demonstrated to yield better results at lower doses. These vaccines have been used to immunize different small and large animal models and the results have demonstrated that they can induce a significantly higher and longerlasting antibody response in comparison with naked DNA vaccine or even purified recombinant proteins [84] [85] [86] . However, the most important contribution of phages to vaccine development is the production of phage display vaccines. This phage-based antigen delivery approach is gaining a growing interest and has been suggested as a prospective tool in the area of vaccine design. Within the past years, phage display vaccines have represented a promising approach for vaccine development. In phage display vaccine, the foreign antigen is displayed on the phage surface. This is generally achieved by expressing the antigen of interest as fusion to one of the surface proteins of the virion. Since there are multiple copies of the desired antigen on the surface of each phage particle, phagedisplayed vaccines are able to provide a high level of Fig. 3 Phage DNA vs. phage display vaccine a) In phage DNA vaccine, a eukaryotic gene expression cassette containing the antigen sequence is cloned into the phage genome. Therefore, the antigen expression is under the control of eukaryote-derived regulatory sequences. b In phage display vaccine as the main phage-based strategy for vaccine design, the vaccine sequence is cloned into the phage coat protein gene. Therefore, the antigenic amino acids are expressed as fusion to the coat protein on the phage surface. These antigenic amino acid residues are readily presented to the immune system antigen exposure to the immune system. However, the display of antigenic epitopes in a properly folded and functioning conformation that could elicit a strong immune response is a significant issue which deserves further attention in the development of phage display vaccines. Sometimes, rather than constructing a transcriptional fusion to a coat protein, phage disply vaccines may be created by conjugating the antigenic substance to the phage surface via artificial linkers [87] . The exploitation of this strategy for the construction of phage display vaccines may diversify the range of antigens that can be displayed on the surface of immunogenic phage particles. However, antigen is not encoded by the phage genome in this strategy and thus the vaccine construct should be prepared every time it is needed. This is in striking contrast to the genetic approach in which phage virions have the antigenic sequence in their genomes. Therefre, they can continually produce the vaccine construct through convenient bacterial amplification and do not need to repetitively attach the antigenic substance to the phage surface.",28.63865268341474,14.019319624097351

In early stage of vaccine development, in vitro serum antibodies and ELISpot assays are the direct detectable indicators of the clinical potential of a vaccine formulation. At later stage of development, morbidity and mortality (especially the improvement of survival rate after vaccination) in animals upon target pathogen challenge is a more certain way to confirm the protective efficacy of vaccines [28, 29] , as the ultimate goal of vaccine is to prevent the targeted disease. The efficacy of vaccine such as influenza vaccine could be monitored in human during subsequent influenza epidemic season [30, 31] or challenged with a controlled influenza virus [32] .

Antibacterial vaccines, both cellular and acellular, are still considered the most cost effective intervention against bacterial infections. Implementation of vaccine schedules has decreased worldwide the morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases such as diphtheria, pneumococcal and pertussis diseases. However, the treatment and prevention of other common bacterial infections, including but not limited to Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter pylori, Shigella spp. or Escherichia coli is still not possible [15] .",25.6537476769404,13.04224182933179

In most of the cases, in vivo DENV studies classically involve immunodeficient mouse strains such as AG129 which do not express IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptors. These mice are highly susceptible to DENV infection and generally die within two weeks after injection [166] [167] [168] . Following advancement of the knowledge about host-pathogen interactions and the advent of novel technologies (e.g., by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing), a paradigm shift can be anticipated. As an example of this, using a gene knock-in approach and a mouse-adapted virus strain, Gorman and colleagues recently developed an immunocompetent transgenic mouse model of ZIVK infection by replacing the mouse STAT2 by the human STAT2 [169] . This genetic engineering was conceptually made possible thanks to previous studies which showed that ZIKV induces the degradation of human STAT2 but not of the mouse ortholog [123, 124, 170] .

The basic rout of large-scale screening of the leptospirosis vaccines is shown in Fig. 3 . Before recombinant protein vaccines against leptospirosis can be used for clinical application, extensive testing is required. Recombinant protein vaccines must be free of contaminations, they should be stable and safe, and easy to transport and store. It has been found that a LPS vaccine may be serovar-independent. For example, LPS vaccine prepared from L. biflexa serovar Patoc can effectively protect hamsters against L. interrogans serovar Manilae. In this case, the protective effect strongly depended on the dose and administration times of LPS vaccine prepared from L. biflexa serovar Patoc [104] . However, it was also reported that a LPS vaccine can be serovar-dependent; for example, LPS vaccines prepared from several different serovar strains could not induce a protective immune response in gerbils against the strains of different serovars [105] .

To commercialize a plant-derived HBV vaccine, several points should be considered. First, the greatest barrier is the low expression levels of HBV antigen in plants; however, expression yield and plant production scale can still be increased using plant expression vector optimization, which should be focused on the target plant. The process can also be more competitive by improving the plant-derived antigen to increase the immune response to the vaccine. Second, an HBV antigen expressed in an edible plant has the advantage of being usable as an oral vaccine without processing. It is first necessary to analyze the characteristics of the target plants and the expressed protein for the development of an oral vaccine because plant components, secondary metabolites and foreign protein expression characteristics vary with plant species. To obtain feasible and cost-effective vaccines, the target plants for edible vaccines should have a long shelf life, be heat stable and be edible as a raw material. Candidate grain crops are maize and rice; candidate vegetative crops are tomato and banana. Third, consideration should be made of the public's acceptance of GM crops, especially plant-derived edible vaccines. For injected vaccine development, the most cost-effective method is a suspension culture in a closed environment, according to the regulations of good manufacturing practice. Further safety of plant-derived vaccines can be obtained by following the same regulations established for traditional vaccines. In addition, for oral vaccines produced from GM crops, environmental risk assessment and human risk assessment should be performed. For these reasons, plant-derived oral vaccines cannot be called cost efficient compared with traditional vaccines, and the current concern over the use of GM plants is now affecting research in this field.

Cohorts of animals are infected and euthanized, and viral load or immune responses are measured in predetermined tissues. This produces static snapshots of replication only at specific times and specific sites within the animal. Moreover, inherent animal-to-animal variability introduces significant confounding effects, resulting in studies that require hundreds of animals to acquire statistical significance. The power of these traditional approaches can be complemented, and many of these limitations overcome, by using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) (Fig 1) .

We have moved from the inability to protect from infection in various animal models of disease to a realm of medical countermeasures that protect prophylactically and more recently successful treatments that can be employed following known exposure to the viruses. Initial efforts, focused on preventing the disease with vaccination strategies, ranged from subunit vaccines to VLPs, vectored systems, DNA vaccines, and live-attenuated virus systems that express the EBOV or MARV glycoproteins. To that aim, vaccine efficacy has been achieved by multiple vaccines against parenteral and aerosol routes of exposure. With the success of these new vaccine platforms, the attention of the past 5 years has focused on the ability to treat infected patients. In the animal models, success has been demonstrated with traditional small molecules and antibodies directed against the virus or critical host proteins or pathways associated with pathogenesis. The ability to utilize various RNA silencing technologies has been a focus for therapeutics that could be beneficial for filovirus infection, other infectious diseases and cancer therapy. Despite these successes, there is much work to do to adequately prepare for this infectious threat. The ability to provide a beneficial therapeutic impact at a point when patients experience clinical symptoms and seek relief from caregivers remains a hurdle for the medical countermeasure development. Moreover, the quality of life of patients following infection and treatment may require additional development efforts or the combination of multiple therapeutic approaches. As seen in outbreaks, the clinical sequelae observed in patients that survive infection are severe and life changing. These observations emphasize the need for medical countermeasures that not only provide survival but also decrease morbidity and long-term pathological outcomes following infection. Lastly, the funding resources fortitude and the ability to navigate regulatory pathways will be essential to reaching either emergency use authorization (EUA) status or licensed drug status for therapeutics and vaccines.

Although there are some differences in the length of gestation, placental structure, and fetal development between humans and animal models, many structural and functional parallels exist, [94] [95] [96] which serve as tractable platforms for evaluating the safety and efficacy of various therapies during pregnancy. Similar to humans, pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have a hemochorial placenta, and their relatively short gestation and large litters are advantageous for performing high throughput screening of candidate therapeutics for safety and efficacy. Preclinical behavioral testing of rodent offspring has proven to be a promising avenue for identifying and predicting adverse effects associated with prenatal drug exposure in children. 97 Both rodent and rabbit models have been instrumental in testing teratogenic effects of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treating malaria in pregnant women. These studies concluded that drug-related teratogenic effects are limited to the first trimester, which supports the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that artemisinin may be administered only during the second or third trimester in pregnant women. 98, 99 One limitation of mouse and rat models, however, is their inability to recapitulate certain elements of human congenital disease. For instance, because murine CMV is not transmitted vertically as it is in humans, other animal models, including guinea pigs and nonhuman primates, are required for studying this aspect of disease pathogenesis. Studies in pregnant nonhuman primates have been instrumental for the identification of CD4 + T cell responses as critical for early control of CMV infection and transmission during pregnancy, 100 and studies in guinea pigs have demonstrated that a single-cycle infectious CMV vaccine induces immune responses similar to natural infection and protects against congenital infection. 101 Guinea pigs are also a useful model of chlamydial genital infection in humans. Experimental venereal infection with Chlamydophila caviae mimics disease associated with C. trachomatis in humans, including both sexual and perinatal transmission. Guinea pigs have therefore served as a useful model for testing candidate vaccines and treatments. 102 Rabbits continue to serve as an important model of venereal infection with Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, which is associated with congenital disease in humans. While natural infection in rabbits is associated with the species-specific T. paraluiscanuculi, rabbits can be experimentally inoculated with human T. pallidum, and have been instrumental in testing the efficacy of candidate vaccines. 103 Many mammalian species, including rodents, 104 ruminants, 105 and nonhuman primates, 40, 106 are susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and demonstrate similar fetal complications when infection occurs during pregnancy. Studies in various animal models have uniquely contributed to our understanding of placental listeriosis and serve as a platform for evaluating prevention strategies. 107, 108 Finally, mice, 85 cotton rats, 86 guinea pigs, 88 and sheep 87 are all susceptible to infection with RSV, and vaccination of pregnant animals has facilitated the development and testing of maternal immunization strategies for protecting against neonatal RSV.

Having an animal model that can recapitulate human disease is essential for vaccine and therapeutic development as well as testing. For a potential animal model to be susceptible to infection, the virus must be able to 1.) gain entry into host cells; 2.) overcome the host's antiviral responses; and 3.) disseminate virus following infection to allow infection of other neighbouring cells and tissues. It is also of importance for the model to be able to recapitulate human disease and viral transmission modes. When evaluating the ability of an animal to be infected by a virus and serve as a model, viral shedding, clinical disease, and seroconversion should be determined. The past animal models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not universal due to the expression of the virus-specific cellular receptors for entry [63] . As SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not share a cellular receptor, they do not share the same host range and susceptibility, which includes research animal models [64] . Cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, and cats were some of the first animals to be determined susceptible to SARS-CoV [65, 66] . The advantage of ferrets is that they are a smaller animal compared to non-human primates and also are able to recapitulate some of the clinical symptoms and transmission kinetics of human respiratory viruses including coughing, sneezing, fever, and weight loss [67] . Although mice can be infected with SARS-CoV, as shown by recovery of vRNA and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, infection does not cause severe disease [68] . However, SARS-CoV could be passaged in mice (15 times) for the establishment of a model with clinical features [69] . After the identification of MERS-CoV, it was quickly determined that typical research animal models were not susceptible to the virus including mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets. Larger non-human primate models, such as Rhesus macaques and common marmoset were determined susceptible. To make use of small animal models, transgenic mice have been engineered for MERS-CoV susceptibility through expression of the human DPP4 receptor [70] . Other attempts at other mouse model developments were not successful, including an immunocompromised 129/SATA1-/-1 mouse [63] . Having an understanding of the animal models and model development previously utilized for the other coronaviruses of interest will aid in the development of a model for 2019-nCoV.

The recent advancements in the technological and bioinformatics fields enable computer-based approaches for this purpose. Peptide vaccines have been in use against animals for some time.

Recombinant DNA technology and naked DNA have been used to induce immune response against virus infections; synthetic peptide vaccines have been the other approach in peptide vaccinology [19] . These have prompted adaptations along similar lines to develop vaccines for new viruses; the NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), under the NIH (National Institute of Health), USA, has taken up the case of the Zika virus with urgency and is pursuing several paths, including a DNA-based vaccine using a strategy similar to that of a flavivirus vaccine for West Nile Virus, a live-attenuated version of the Zika virus and a genetically engineered version of vesicular stomatitis virus, all of them are presently on the lab bench [20] .",26.720708323136307,10.904677162980404

The efforts toward development of vaccines against this deadly virus have also been continuously increasing leading to the emergence of promising interventions. The two viruses, in other words, SARS and MERS have some common challenges in the development of an efficacious vaccine. As evident from reports, the aged population is more vulnerable to MERS-CoV. The lesson learnt from preclinical studies of SARS-CoV suggests that vaccines fail to protect aged animals, while being effective in young ones. Similarly, in clinical settings, the risk of mortality is even higher in individuals with chronic conditions or an immunocompromised state. An effective vaccine, thus, should offer universal protection, including the vulnerable populations. To do so, there is a need to evaluate the promising vaccines in the comorbid chronic conditions and the immunocompromised rodent models. Since the virus can comfortably replicate in macrophages, the risk of vaccine-derived immunopathology cannot be negated and must be considered using heterologous challenge models. Further, balance must be struck between protection and excessive immune activation while evaluating a successful vaccine candidate. The vaccine development against MERS-CoV is mostly influenced by the SARS-CoV. However, to aid the development of better vaccines, there is need to further enhance the knowledge of pathology of MERS-CoV and outline critical differences between SARS and MERS-CoV. mAbs offers a window of opportunity, as a few candidates have shown potency in in vitro testing. However, care needs to be taken in humanizing mAbs so as to minimize the antimouse antibody response. Epitopes identified from mouse neutralizing mAbs can be neutralized for humanizing MERS-CoV. mAbs targeting RBD are reported to have higher potency than therapies directed against other S protein regions of MERS-CoV, as these could recognize critical residues for DPP4 binding. However, changes in such critical residues may render these mAbs ineffective and lead to development of escape mutant strains of the virus. As discussed, a few promising peptides have also been developed against MERS-CoV. The antiviral activity, stability and solubility of these peptides can be further improved similar to the peptides developed against HIV. This will lead to the development of optimized next generation peptides having better inhibitory action directed against MERS-CoV. Alternatively, as a novel approach, the peptide inhibitors can be combined with mAbs (e.g., RBD specific). The combination can be evaluated for the synergistic effect against divergent and resistant strains. Studies are also needed to explore novel delivery technologies and optimizing vaccine immunity with a suitable combination of adjuvants. In summary, there have been encouraging results in the area of the development of MERS-CoV vaccines in preclinical settings.

These animal models are indispensable for the deeper understanding of any diseases and safe and protective vaccine development process (Lorenzen et al., 2015) . The main criteria for the validation of animal models in preclinical studies are face validity, predictive validity and target validity. The face validity means that the proper similarity between the animal model and the human disease in terms of the biology and symptoms of the disease. However, assessing face validity is a tedious task due to the lack of understanding on the core biology of the disease symptoms. Predictive validity means the display of clinical interventions which exhibited similar effect in the animal models. This is also very difficult to achieve due to the incomplete correlation between animal models, the mechanism of human diseases and the incapability of standard drugs to active in many animal models. Target validity is another essential component for the validation of animal models in which the target under study must have an analogous function in the disease model as in the clinical condition (Denayer et al., 2014) . An ideal animal model is the one where an immunocompetent animal, on receiving the challenge virus at a realistic dose through a suitable inoculation route, is able to replicate the characteristics of a human disease as closely as possible (Doremalen and Munster, 2015) . Ferrets, hamsters, mice and other small laboratory animals are not ideal animal models for MERS-CoV owing to the variations in DPP4 receptor. The rhesus macaque and the common marmoset are the first non-human primate species (NPS) to be used as the animal models for MERS-CoV. Glycosylation of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) prevents its binding to S protein of MERS-CoV. Hence, transgenic hDPP4 (human DPP4) mice were developed as animal model (Peck et al., 2015) .

A dengue vaccine sponsored by Sanofi Pasteur has been licensed in multiple dengue endemic countries, and several candidate vaccines are at various stages of development (73) . Although the US military has maintained interest in several different candidate vaccine to prevent dengue, Sanofi Pasteur in 2010 initiated the first phase 2b proof of concept trial using their CYD tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV). The trial was conducted in Thailand among 4,000 children aged 4-11 years. CYD-TDV is composed of four chimeric live-attenuated viruses (CYD1-4) based on a yellow fever vaccine backbone (YF 17D) with structural DENV proteins (74) . Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that a three-dose vaccination regimen induced balanced immune responses to all four serotypes, and pre-existing flavivirus infection seemed to induce a more rapid immune response with no increase in vaccine-derived viremia. Unfortunately, this tetravalent vaccine did not provide equal protection against all four dengue serotypes, with especially low efficacy against DENV-2 (75). Subsequent multi-country phase III trials in Asia and Latin America in 2-to 16-year-old children showed good efficacy against DENV-3 and 4, moderate efficacy against DENV-1 and marginal efficacy against DENV-2. Notably, an increase in relative risk of severe dengue in vaccine recipients aged 2-5 years during the third year of the Asian phase III trial (76, 77) led to the age indication of children 9 years of age and above. CYD-TDV (trademarked as Dengvaxia ® ) eventually received licensure in 20 dengue endemic countries but has not yet been approved in the US. Based on an assessment of potential overall public health benefit, WHO recommended in July 2016 that vaccination could be carried out in highly endemic areas (>70% dengue seropositive rates) (65, 78) . However, in November 2017 Sanofi, who continued to monitor safety of their vaccine, announced the results from a new laboratory test that could infer dengue serostatus prior to vaccination in subjects from their phase III trials and found that seronegative persons of any age (including those >9 years) who receive Dengvaxia ® had a higher risk of severe dengue. On April 19, 2018, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization revised their recommendations, emphasizing individual testing before vaccinating in order to minimize the likelihood of seronegative individuals receiving Dengvaxia ® . 1 The US army initially focused on tetravalent live-attenuated vaccine candidates, entering into a partnership with GSK in early 2000. A tetravalent live-attenuated dengue vaccine candidate was eventually evaluated in a phase II clinical trial in Puerto Rico (79) .

Notably, the efficacy of vaccines against IAV infections can fluctuate and there is a significant immune response variability across the population. Factors such as previous exposure to IAV infections or vaccines, age, and the closeness of the match between the vaccine and circulating strains are important to explain differences in vaccine effectiveness between seasons and group populations [44, 46, [150] [151] [152] . However, multiple reports have demonstrated that the host genetic background and polymorphisms on key immune response genes modulate the immune response to infection or vaccination [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] .

The activation of immune cells by GNPs, shown by several authors, may serve as a basis to develop new vaccine adjuvants. As in the case of the usual cells, interactions with various types of receptors on the surface of immune cells and, correspondingly, various types of GNP endocytosis depend largely on the surface functionalization of GNPs. Many researchers believe that the key role in macrophage uptake of GNPs is played by scavenger receptors. However, the interaction of functionalized GNPs with cells of the immune system is still far from being understood in more or less detail and requires further study. 236 In conclusion, it may be said that the time is probably right to talk of not only the biochemistry but also the biophysics of immune response, because it is the unique biophysical properties of metallic particles-in particular, the surface charge and the electrostatic eld of the particle (inuencing, in a certain manner, the charge, orientation and polarization of the antigen molecules adsorbed on the particles)-that have to signicantly affect the immune-response process.",27.876971020003857,11.085363072450205

The clinical assays with which the immune response and pathogen presence are measured in vaccine trials become part of the basis for licensure for all vaccine products [4] . Because vaccines are tested in healthy populations through all phases of clinical development for immune response and/or pathogen presence whereas drugs/biologics (post-Phase I) are most often tested in a population with specific disease to demonstrate improvement, the selected methods to measure vaccine responses and endpoints are of the utmost importance.

Consequently, there is a mixture of more or less natural relationships between the parasites and the rodent hosts when the latter are used as translational models for human infections (see Table 2 ). Many parasite genera contain species which naturally infect rodents (e.g., Plasmodium, Giardia, Cryptosporidium), although in most cases the very same species do not also infect humans. For other parasite species, the rodent model has been made susceptible, frequently by genetic means, to human relevant parasites (e.g., P. falciparum or C. parvum/C. hominis).

Studies in animal models have demonstrated that orally or nasally administered immunobiotics are able to improve protection against IFV by three main mechanisms. First, immunobiotics increase the respiratory antiviral state by their capacity to improve levels of type I IFNs, the number and activity of antigen presenting cells, NK cells, CD4 + IFN-γ + T, and IgA + B lymphocytes, as well as the levels of systemic and mucosal specific antibodies. Second, immunobiotics beneficially modulate the IFV-triggered respiratory inflammatory response by inducing changes in the levels and kinetics of proinflammatory factors and immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-10 that allow the clearance of virus with a minimal inflammatory lung tissue damage. Finally, as demonstrated by our recent research works, immunobiotics modulate lung immune-coagulative response triggered by TLR3 activation or IFV infection, mainly by downregulating lung TF and restoring TM levels. Studies in animal models suggest that immunobiotics would influence principally the innate immune response, modulating in that way the early antiviral inflammatory response and the subsequent cellular and humoral immune responses. Therefore, immunobiotics would have mainly an adjuvant effect. However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which immunobiotics differentially modulate the innate antiviral immune response against IFV remain to be elucidated.",26.270910819842484,10.968948183621885

This defect can be corrected by several treatments, including depletion of inhibitory macrophages from the lungs and direct activation of respiratory dendritic cells, important in initiating the immune response or transfer of activated dendritic cells prior to infection. All of these modalities result in improved initiation of the immune response and an enhanced anti-virus T cell response. Inefficient activation of the immune response may play a role in human SARS, and our results suggest possible strategies that might be used to develop novel anti-viral therapies.",26.362307375924107,11.407513969331692

Additionally, much of the population, such as the aged or immunocompromised, are unable to mount an effective immunologic response for existing vaccines. Vectored Immunoprophylaxis (VIP) is a novel approach designed to address these challenges. Rather than utilizing an antigen to trigger a response from the host's immune system as is normally done with traditional vaccines, VIP genetically engineers the production of tailored antibodies from non-hematopoietic cells, bypassing the humoral immune system. Direct administration of genes encoding for neutralizing antibodies has proven to be effective in both preventing and treating several infectious diseases in animal models. While, a significant amount of work has focused on HIV, including an ongoing clinical trial, the approach has also been shown to be effective for malaria, dengue, hepatitis C, influenza, and more. In addition to presenting itself as a potentially efficient approach to solving long-standing vaccine challenges, the approach may be the best, if not only, method to vaccinate immunocompromised individuals. Many issues still need to be addressed, including which tissue(s) makes the most suitable platform, which vector(s) are most efficient at transducing the platform tissue used to secrete the antibodies, and what are the long-term effects of such a treatment.

Binding of MHCI or MHCII receptors on T-cells results in the activation of either a CD8 + T-cell (cytotoxic T-cell) or a CD4 + T-cell (helper T-cell) immune response, respectively (44) . In mammals, numerous cellular studies have confirmed the ability of DNA vaccines to induce a cellular immune response in the control of pathogenic infections (45) (46) (47) (48) . Indeed, one study showed that the percentage of CD3 + CD4 + CD8 − and CD3 + CD8 + CD4 − T-cells identified in the spleen of mice increased in response to DNA vaccines encoding the GRA17 and GRA23 genes from Toxoplasma gondii (49) . To date, cellular immune responses induced by DNA vaccines in fish models have largely been investigated via transcriptional responses. This has been due to the lack of availability of antibodies for markers of specific T-cell subpopulations (50) (51) (52) (53) . Recently, with the production of specific antibodies for fish T lymphocytes, it has become possible to investigate cellular immune responses at the translational level. This has been exemplified by the investigation of cellular immune responses induced by various antigens in carp and rainbow trout (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) . In this study, we used FCM analysis of single stained CD4-1 + , CD4-2 + , and CD8β + cells to evaluate the cellular immune responses induced by the pVAA vaccine. High percentages of CD4-1 + , CD4-2 + , and CD8β + T lymphocytes were observed in the peripheral blood, spleen, and head kidney of fish vaccinated with pVAA compared to the tissues of fish injected with the negative control pcDNA3.1. This is in line with the findings of a previous study indicating that DNA vaccines are able to induce an adaptive cellular immune response, via the upregulation of CD4 and CD8 (60) . The proliferation of antigen-specific T-cells in pVAA vaccinated flounder fish following bacterial infection indicates the induction of a specific cellular immune response and demonstrates the potential of this antigen as a vaccine candidate. Correspondingly, a previous report of a viral infection-specific T-cell immune response induced by a DNA vaccine to the spring viremia of carp virus was identified through the proliferation of Zap70 + T-cells (42) . This opens up the potential of future studies evaluating a possible antigen-specific T-cell response induced by the pVAA DNA vaccine.",27.131033361709992,12.712281707192368

Therefore, one must keep in mind that pre-clinical immunogenicity or even protection/therapy, and human immunogenicity are low hurdles and are not predictive of human efficacy. One reason this is so challenging is that, for many of the diseases under evaluation, scientists do not know which immune response or combination of immune responses and which antigen targets are the crucial elements for efficacy; the vaccine technology alone is not the only piece of the puzzle.

Consensus immunogens can focus the immune response towards conserved regions of important antigens, allowing for increased T cell cross reactivity as well as partially compensating for minor variability in the vaccine targeted antigens [48] [49] [50] . Consensus sequences using GD1 (type 1), B95-8 (type 1), and AG876 (type 2) EBV genes were generated for all 3 antigens ( Figure 1A ) to optimize the ability of the vaccines to elicit immune responses against all common viral strains, which are phylogenetically similar [51] . Modifications were made to remove repetitive sequences and to ablate oncogenic properties inherent to the proteins while preserving the structures of the antigens ( Figure 1B ). EBNA1vax had repetitive sequence removed, and all three antigens had amino acids modified to abrogate functional regions and cell signaling pathways (Appendix A Figure A1 ). Phylogenetic trees show close relationships between the vaccine antigens and known sequences from viral isolates ( Figure 1C ). Large deletions were made to repetitive sequences when engineering EBNA1vax, leading to divergence from known EBNA1 sequences and the long branch away in the diagram, although the retained sequences are well-conserved. The LMP vaccines lie well within their phylogenetic trees, with LMP1 demonstrating roughly 10-fold more diversity than LMP2A.

The RV-based MERS-CoV vaccine platform can rapidly induce antibody immune response and higher cellular immune response than the GEM-based vaccine platform. However, there is a risk of incomplete inactivation in the process of inactivating the RV/MERS. Additionally, RV/MERS vaccine needs to be purified through many purification steps. These factors must be considered in vaccine production. Antigen protein density and distribution on a particle are two key parameters in eliciting an efficient immune response in vaccine design; a high density and ordered antigenic array displayed on a particle makes binding events between the host B-cell surface immunoglobulins and the particle occur more easily, which is an important step in inducing sequential immune response [47] . The GEM-based vaccine platform could display antigen protein in a high density, while the RV-based vaccine platform not only displayed the antigen protein but also expressed the RV GP protein. This may be why the GEM-based vaccine of MERS-CoV induces a much stronger humoral immune response in mice than that of the RV-based vaccine. Micro-particles could promote a humoral immune response, and nano-particles are much easier to induce a cellular immune response [48, 49] . The size of the RV/MERS virion is about 167 nm, and the diameter of the MERS BLP particles is about 2161 nm. This may be a critical factor in inducing a different cellular immune response by two different vectors of vaccine platforms. Specific molecules of microbial origin, as intrinsic innate immune triggers, are endowed with adjuvant activity, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial lipopeptides, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and other conserved molecules [50] . The receptors for these molecules are the mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Members of the TLRs have been confirmed on the cell surface membrane (TLR1/2/4/5/6/10) and on the membrane of endosomes (TLR3/7/8/9) [51] . Peptidoglycan, the main component of the GEM particles, is a TLR 2 ligand which is an activation of TLR-2 receptors in human peripheralblood mononuclear cells inducing a Th1-type immune response [52] . Single stranded RNA, the component of inactivated rabies virus, is a TLR 7 ligand [51, 53] . TLR7/8 agonists have shown Th1 polarizing effects on the immune response. Different receptors play an important role in delivering different signals to the host cells. The activated antigen presenting cells (APCs) precisely define the nature of the perceived danger and send this information to the secondary lymphoid organs, inducing relevant adaptive immune response. This may be another ignored factor of inducing a different immune response by the immune system thinking that the danger is from a virus infection or a bacterial infection. The immune system is triggered by a combination of events and stimuli in vaccine immunology. The compound adjuvants containing the emulsion and PolyI:C (TLR 3 ligand) may be another assignable cause. The speed of the antibodies' production and cellular immune response needs to be further improved in future study of the GEM-based vaccine platform. To solve the problems, we can try to screen optimum adjuvants for the vaccine or co-displaying protein-adjuvants on GEM particles, such as flagellin (TLR 5 ligand). Furthermore, the GEM-based vaccine platform may be more suitable to develop mucosal vaccines considering that Lactococcus lactis has been safely used as a probiotic in our foods. Understanding the modes of action of the GEM-based vaccine platform will allow us to design a much safer, cost-effective, and protective vaccine with the desired immune response.",29.049397564875367,12.943900750012743

Deletion of E protein abrogated the virulence of CoVs, and several studies have explored the potential of recombinant SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV with a mutated E protein as live attenuated vaccines 13, 14 . The M protein can augment the immune response induced by N protein DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV; 15 however, the conserved N protein across CoV families implies that it is not a suitable candidate for vaccine development, and the antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 do not provide immunity to the infection 16 . The critical glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for virus binding and entry 16 . The S precursor protein of SARS-CoV-2 can be proteolytically cleaved into S1 (685 aa) and S2 (588 aa) subunits 10 . The S2 protein is well conserved among SARS-CoV-2 viruses and shares 99% identity with that of bat SARS-CoVs 10 . The vaccine design based on the S2 protein may boost the broad-spectrum antiviral effect and is worth testing in animal models. Antibodies against the conserved stem region of influenza hemagglutinin have been found to exhibit broadly cross-reactive immunity, but are less potent in neutralizing influenza A virus 17 . In contrast, the S1 subunit consists of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates virus entry into sensitive cells through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 18 . The S1 protein of 2019-nCoV shares about 70% identity with that of human SARS-CoVs. The highest number of variations of amino acids in the RBD is located in the external subdomain, which is responsible for the direct interaction between virus and host receptor 10, 18 . Blocking the initial entry of a virus is proposed as a successful strategy in controlling viral infection. Based on SARS vaccine development, most vaccine candidates target the S protein, which induces neutralizing antibody responses and stimulates a protective cellular immunity against SARS-CoVs 12 . Bukreyev et al. 19 showed that immunization of African green monkeys with the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV protects monkeys from subsequent homologous SARS-CoV challenge. Administration of SARS-CoV RBD proteins can also induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies and long-term protective immunity in animal models 20 . Thus, the generation of antibodies targeting the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 would be an important preventive and treatment strategy that can be tested further in suitable models before clinical trials 10 .",26.596422316782878,12.408963424716017

Host factors are the third aspect that is equally critical and deserves more attention. If the host fails to mount an adequate immune response or refuses to get vaccinated, it is irrelevant no matter how good the influenza vaccine is. Immunosenescence that occurs during aging is believed to be a major host factor responsible for the impaired immune protection of influenza vaccination in older adults, further review of which is beyond the scope of this article. [21] [22] [23] Age-related conditions, such as frailty, as well as sex and gender are other important clinical, biological, and social host factors that have significant impact on influenza vaccine immune response and clinical protection. 15, 24, 25 Emerging evidence suggests that stem cell therapy may enhance immune response to influenza immunization in aging frailty. 26, 27 Innovation and research will help develop strategies to address these and other host factors. Cutting-edge geroscience research may pave the way for the development of such interventional strategies. 28, 29 Government agencies, health-care providers, academic institutions, and the vaccine manufacturing industry are key players in this proposed roadmap. Other entities, including philanthropic foundations, international organizations, and venture capitalists, may also play important roles. Government agencies are responsible for policies and regulations, such as those on health insurance coverage of influenza vaccination cost and vaccine quality control and supply (red solid arrows, Figure 1 ).

First of all, it takes time to develop suitable animal models for newly emerging respiratory infections. Second, for each new vaccine, antigen potency and purity assays need to be developed for the appropriate quality assessment of the MVA vaccine preparations. Third, each new rMVA virus is a new biological entity. Therefore, each new vaccine must be tested thoroughly. However, in the case of a severe pandemic there would likely be no time to go through all the phases of clinical trials. Furthermore, combination vaccination strategies, e.g., priming with an adenovirus vector and boosting with an MVA vaccine, will lead to complicated regulatory procedures because two distinct biological entities need to be approved. Fourth, even though all the hands-on development work can be done rapidly, non-clinical safety testing, e.g., toxicity studies and ethics approval for animal experiments and clinical trials, and registration of the vaccine always depend on external parties, which could substantially slow down the development.

The origins of MERS-CoV, likely in African bats, are increasingly clear, although important questions remain about the establishment of dromedary camels as a reservoir seeding human outbreaks. Likewise, there have been important advances in the development of animal models, and both non-human primate and mouse models that seem to recapitulate human disease are now available. How MERS-CoV evades and inhibits the host innate immune response remains less clear. Although several studies have identified MERS-CoV proteins as innate immune antagonists, little of this work has been conducted using live virus under conditions of actual infection, but rather with ectopically expressed proteins.

Generally, DNA may be administered by different methods such as intradermal (i.d.), intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) [11] . In many cases, cutaneous administration has been associated with immunological benefits, such as the induction of greater immune responses compared with those elicited by other routes of delivery. However, the results of vaccination via the skin, have sometimes been conflicting, due to the lack of delivery devices that accurately and reproducibly administer vaccines to the skin [12] . In addition, the nasal route as a site of vaccine delivery for both local and systemic effect is currently of considerable interest. The success of intranasally delivered mucosal vaccines has been also limited by lack of effective vaccine formulations or delivery systems suitable for use in humans. Nowadays, the properties of polyacrylate polymer-based particulate systems are studied to facilitate mucosal immune responses [13] . However, conventional vaccinations involve subcutaneous or intradermal inoculations. It has been demonstrated in several preclinical animal models and some clinical studies that intratumoral and/or intra-nodal vaccination may be more effective than other routes.

The evaluation of an antiviral, in the context of a host with a functioning immune system, enables better understanding of therapeutics' potential efficacy. The evaluation of an antiviral in the context of an impaired immune system enables better understanding of therapeutic use in a particular immunosuppressed population. Pathogen host range, especially if not a simple issue of receptor utilization, can confound the ability to interpret, and extrapolate to the human, some of the nuances of the host pathogen interaction and prediction of potential human therapeutic benefit. Of the small animal models used to evaluate antiviral efficacy, all have used stringent virus challenges (all greater than 10 × LD 50 ) and shown survival benefit. Routes of infection have used methods that attempt to simulate potential human routes of infection and resultant human illness courses. Given the uncertainties of what a human infectious or lethal monkeypox dose is, it is difficult to extrapolate the potential -best fit‖ of any of these models for human disease. The clinical time course of disease in the prairie dog model, however, has a temporal relationship that is close to what has been described with human systemic orthopoxvirus (variola or monkeypox) disease. However, a limitation of the prairie dog and some of the other described animal systems, with the exception of the mouse model, is a paucity of immune reagents. There are a handful of antiviral compounds which show promise in these small animal models using monkeypox virus as the challenge.

Many veterinary vaccines are extremely pro-inflammatory in nature, an example being Clostridial vaccines used in cattle. When delivered subcutaneously, these vaccines tend to result in a large swelling which can persist for months. On the other hand, intramuscular injection does not result in overt swelling but causes significant tissue damage near the injection site. The cost associated with carcass trimming has been estimated to be between $1.46 and $40.00 per animal [19] . In addition, it is not uncommon for needles to break during intramuscular delivery, causing problems at processing, as well as the retail level. While injection of the antigens themselves can result in tissue damage, most killed vaccines also contain strong adjuvants which contribute to this damage. Adjuvants significantly increase the cost of the vaccines and also dictate both the quality and magnitude of the immune response, the former of which has been biased towards Th2 immune responses. Adjuvants currently in use are suitable for injection, but most are not compatible with mucosal delivery [20] .

In mouse models, DNA vaccines have been successfully directed against a wide variety of tumors, almost exclusively by driving strong cellular immune responses in an antigen-specific fashion [9] . However, there is still a need to improve the delivery of DNA vaccines and to increase the immunogenicity of antigens expressed from the plasmids [8, 9] . For example, tumor burden has been decreased by novel DNA vaccine strategies that deliver cytokines as plasmids directly into tumors in both mouse and human models. Altogether, the selected trials for DNA vaccines have shown that immune responses can be generated in humans, but they also highlight the need for increased potency if this vaccine technology is to be effective [9] . The reasons for the failure of DNA vaccines to induce potent immune responses in humans have not been elucidated. However, it is reasonable to assume that low levels of antigen production, inefficient cellular delivery of DNA plasmids and insufficient stimulation of the innate immune system have roles in low potency of DNA vaccine [10] . Therefore, with further optimization DNA vaccine strategies can be improved, with significant effects on the outcome of immunization. In designing vaccine, clearly regimens, plasmid dose, timing of doses, adjuvants, delivery systems and/or routes of vaccination must be considered [11] . Indeed, efforts to improve these aspects of DNA vaccines have resulted in their enhanced efficacy in animals. However, the uptake of DNA plasmids by cells upon injection is very inefficient. Nowadays, two basic strategies have been applied for increasing DNA vaccine potency including a) physical delivery to achieve higher levels of antigen production and b) formulation with microparticles to target antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [10] .

DNA vaccine development is based on its advantages compared with conventional vaccines, such as the ability to induce a cellular immune response instead of only a humoral immune response [2] . The expressed antigen could be designed as an extracellular protein, which is detected by Major Histocompability Complex (MHC) class II or an intracellular protein that is recognized by MHC class I. DNA plasmid is also stable at room temperature, facilitating its production and distribution. DNA vaccine production does not directly use the pathogen organism, which is safer for the production system [1, 2] . Some concerns about the DNA vaccine include potential genomic integration and auto-immune response [3] .

In general terms, there are some criteria which a vaccine must satisfy; it must be capable of eliciting the appropriate immune response, and it should be safe, stable, and reproducible. There are other issues such as cost, number of administrations, or immunization route which may also have to be taken into account [1] . Traditional vaccines have been developed using live attenuated organisms (such as BCG-Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella), killed or inactivated whole organisms (e.g., influenza) or inactivated toxins (including diphtheria and tetanus) [2] . Live vaccines have the advantage of producing both humoral and cellular immune responses and often require only one boost. However, these vaccines are environmentally labile and require refrigeration, making difficult the delivery of these therapeutic agents, especially in the developing countries. Furthermore, the use of attenuated pathogens can revert to a more active form, a danger particularly acute in immune-compromised individuals [3] . Killed or inactivated organisms generate a weaker immune response and typically require multiple doses [4] . Hence, these types of vaccines generally require the addition of an adjuvant to be effective [5] . These disadvantages led to the development of subunit vaccines, including synthetic peptides as antigen, which consist of a specific part of the whole pathogen which has been demonstrated to stimulate an immune response. These vaccines are attractive, because they cannot revert to their virulent form and can be produced in bulk, safely and reproducibly. However, subunit vaccines have relatively low immunogenicity [6] which makes necessary the use of adjuvants and/or vaccine delivery systems. Besides, proteinbased vaccines may be degraded by protease activity and have limited bioavailability, since they often cannot cross biological membranes [7, 8] . Finding the optimal combination between a given synthetic peptide and an adjuvant opens an unlimited clinical potential for these vaccines, because if adequate epitopes were identified for a certain disease, antigens could be synthesized on demand. For this reason, successful adjuvants need to be safe and well tolerated, simply produced and with inexpensive compounds, biodegradables, compatibles with many different antigens, and capable of function as a delivery system and immune potentiators [9] . Therefore, for licensing of new or newly formulated vaccines, nonclinical and clinical data regarding safety and efficacy are required, next to pharmaceutical quality data. These data are needed on the active ingredients, as well as the adjuvants and delivery systems, and their combination in the final product [10] . In this regard, there is only one guideline specifically dedicated to peptides, Guidance for Industry for the Submission of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for Synthetic Peptide Substances, published in 1994 [11] , which stipulates the lot release specifications (sufficient to ensure the identity, purity, and strength of the peptide and demonstrate lot-to-lot consistency). The need of eliciting both humoral and cellular immune responses has limited the efficacy against certain pathogens, such as malaria and HIV [3] . Activating the cytolytic immune response (CTL) is needed in the case of intracellular pathogens or tumors, and it is mediated by CD8 T cells, CD4 Th1 cells and natural killer T cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) have several innate features that make them ideal targets for vaccination purposes. They can capture antigens that enter the body and move to the T cell areas of lymphoid organs to find the right clones and start the immune response [10] . In peripheral tissues, DCs are found in an immature stage specialized in capturing foreign antigens. In response to microbes, DCs undergo a process of maturation into antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Meanwhile, they migrate from the periphery to the draining lymph nodes, where they present antigens to the T lymphocytes. DCs can present peptides to the T cells in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II molecules and also glycolipids and glycopeptides to T cells and NKT cells as well as polypeptides to B cells [12] . In order to achieve a CTL response, cytolytic cells must specifically recognize pathogen-derived antigens presented in MHC class I or in the CD1-lipid complex. Upon antigen recognition, immune cells release cytolytic agents that directly destroy infected cells and can induce inflammatory reactions which facilitate innate immune clearance and the development of some humoral response.",25.579910944849082,10.831654787890553

Since its identification in 2001, hMPV has been isolated from individuals of all ages across the world who have acute respiratory tract infections [4] . However, there are currently no effective vaccines or specific therapeutic reagents available for individuals with hMPV. Efforts are being made to develop vaccines against hMPV. However, hMPV challenge with formalin-inactivated hMPV enhances pulmonary disease and Th2 response, suggesting that inactivated hMPV may not be a suitable vaccine candidate [5, 6] . Several viral protein-based vaccine candidates have been developed recently, with some inducing a strong humoral immune response against both homologous and heterologous strains. However, such response diminishes rapidly over time, which might result from the lack of other viral protein(s) contributing to the immunogenicity and immune balance [7] . The other important group of vaccine candidates is recombinant live attenuated hMPV. Recently, a wild-type recombinant hMPV was approved as a suitable parent virus for the development of live attenuated hMPV vaccine candidates in experimental human infection trials [8] , providing a promising vaccine study direction for hMPV. We and others have developed several attenuated recombinant strains of hMPV by gene deletion or mutations [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Compared to other vaccines, live attenuated vaccines offer several advantages for the immunization of infants and young children, including no vaccine-associated enhanced viral disease, the induction of both humoral and mucosal immunity, intranasal vaccine delivery, and viral replication in the upper respiratory tract of young infants despite the presence of passively acquired maternally-derived respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) neutralizing antibodies [14] .",26.377720367513284,10.735944149951898

Homologous recombination requires the use of markers or reporter genes for selecting recombinants, which offers many disadvantages. Apart from the physical space needed for the marker gene, which is limited in therapeutic virus, the use of certain markers can introduce mutations or generate artifacts that are only found after an analysis of the generated virus.

The advent of new imaging and ""omic"" technologies has provided the ability to follow these interactions from whole animal to cellular and molecular levels, enabling a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved; this facilitates the development and refinement of new and existing vaccines and therapeutics. For example, advances in bioimaging provide a noninvasive means of identifying the internal systemic spread of infection in animal models and the impact of a prophylaxis or a therapy on the disease process. This can be combined with the analysis of responses at a cellular level using flow cytometry and microscopy techniques. The use of microarrays has also enhanced our understanding of the host response to infection and provides supportive information to help elucidate the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms essential for protection against pathogens, as well as the virulence mechanisms deployed by the pathogen. Although in its infancy, next generation sequencing also holds great potential for defining host-pathogen interactions. This review will assess the impact of these technologies on the ability to assess the host response and how this has been applied to help progress the development of vaccines and immunotherapies against biodefence agents described in the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) Select Agent list (http://www.selectagents.gov/). Biodefence agents are dangerous pathogens that require high levels of biocontainment and are relatively less-studied (compared with the majority of public health pathogens) and cases are relatively rare.

Due to a multiplicity of evasion mechanisms to circumvent the immune response, e. g. antigenic variability of surface structure [16, 17] as well as production of IgA 1 proteases [18, 19] , there is only a minimal antibody generation detectable after infection. Furthermore, the immune response primarily occurs at the mucosal level that is not sustained leading to potentially high reinfection rates even with the same strain [15] . For these reasons, the development of a vaccine is complex and is not in immediate sight [10, 12] . Nevertheless, by examination and determination of novel immunogenic proteins specific ways for treatment of N. gonorrhoeae could be possibly found, for instance, by inactivating virulence associated proteins preventing infection or by specifically disturbing essential cell processes.",34.96059785517318,15.124942529015659

Part of this response was for development of vaccines for potential use in control, a potential facilitated by the rapid identification of the causative agent, a new coronavirus [8] [9] . Applying the principles of infection control brought the epidemic under control but a concern for reemergence naturally or a deliberate release supported continuation of a vaccine development effort so as to have the knowledge and capability necessary for preparing and using an effective vaccine should a need arise. For this purpose, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases supported preparation of vaccines for evaluation for potential use in humans. This effort was hampered by the occurrence in the initial preclinical trial of an immunopathogenictype lung disease among ferrets and Cynomolgus monkeys given a whole virus vaccine adjuvanted with alum and challenged with infectious SARS-CoV [14] . That lung disease exhibited the characteristics of a Th2-type immunopathology with eosinophils in the lung sections suggesting hypersensitivity that was reminiscent of the descriptions of the Th2-type immunopathologic reaction in young children given an inactivated RSV vaccine and subsequently infected with naturally-occurring RSV [32] [33] . Most of these children experienced severe disease with infection that led to a high frequency of hospitalizations; two children died from the infection [33, 40, 41] . The conclusion from that experience was clear; RSV lung disease was enhanced by the prior vaccination. Subsequent studies in animal models that are thought to mimic the human experience indicate RSV inactivated vaccine induces an increased CD4 + T lymphocyte response, primarily of Th2 cells and the occurrence of immune complex depositions in lung tissues [32, 42, 43] . This type of tissue response is associated with an increase in type 2 cytokines including IL4, IL5, and IL13 and an influx of eosinophils into the infected lung; [32, 33, 42, 44] .",28.332553227256664,13.452113632191047

Potential immune correlates of protection have also been identified in studies by comparing profiles of lymphocyte populations following vaccination (prior to infection) and their responses during infection with Monkeypox virus [110] . In depth assessment of T-cell signatures in vaccines or individuals with naturally acquired F. tularensis infection suggested that these signatures could be used to identify protective correlates of immunity to F. tularensis [111] . Additionally, the identification of putative vaccine candidates [112] and the longevity of immune responses to vaccines have also been greatly aided by flow cytometry in follow-on studies of F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) vaccination [111, 113] . Immune responses to vaccination have also been used in preclinical animal models (murine and primate) and in Phase I clinical trials to assess host responses to a recombinant plague vaccine. Although a number of memory cell phenotypes were investigated, flow cytometry lacked the sensitivity to detect changes in immune profiles between vaccinated and placebo groups [114] .

Among vaccines of a single adenovirus serotype, however, transgene repression should minimize differences in growth kinetics, and chromatographic characteristics are believed to be determined by the (constant) structural proteins rather than the (varying) transgene [36] . It is likely that conditions pre-established to be suitable for a given serotype (i.e. for ChA-dOx2, ChAdOx1 and ChAd63, those conditions used here) will be applicable regardless of the transgene-and hence even those simple optimization experiments may not be necessary to assure satisfactory yields for early-phase clinical trials.

Data from both clinical and animal model studies demonstrate that pathogenic OW and NW arenaviruses elicit vastly different immune responses, which have implications in viral pathogenesis. LASV infection is characterized by weak or delayed IFN-I/ cytokine induction and T-cell responses, while pathogenic NW arenaviruses (JUNV and MACV) trigger a robust IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Though the mechanisms behind these differences remain poorly defined, several observations have been noted. JUNV and MACV infections activate a variety of PRRs likely through dsRNA accumulation, while LASV seems to evade PRR detection. For all arenaviruses tested so far, arenaviral NP and Z proteins are capable of interfering with PRR activation and blocking innate immune signaling in expression studies. Nevertheless, their activity during viral infection remains to be determined. Differences in the innate immune response likely account for the differences seen in the adaptive response to hemorrhagic fever-causing arenaviruses. Overall, LASV clearance is associated with an early and strong cellular immune response, while recent findings have implicated the cellular immune response as a key contributor to the chronic inflammation and sequelae seen in LF survivors. This has profound implications in LASV vaccine development, particularly for those LASV vaccine candidates that are based on a T-cell response. Protection and recovery from pathogenic NW arenavirus infection are mediated by the humoral response. However, pathogenic NW arenaviruses that invade the immune-privileged central nervous system may evade clearance, which potentially causes neurological sequelae. This knowledge may inform the development of a neutralizing antibody-based therapy to treat AHF and BHF patients. Appreciation of the differential immune response to highly pathogenic NW and OW arenaviruses should facilitate the rational design of targeted therapeutics and vaccines.

NHPs infected with LASV typically develop lymphopenia, though survival is correlated with increased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [44, 45] . Survival of NHPs from LASV infection has also been correlated with an early IFN-I response, while fatal NHP infections are characterized by a lack of type I IFN production [44, 45] . A LF chimeric mouse model, in which wild-type bone marrow cells are transplanted into irradiated type I interferon receptor knockout mice, has been developed recently and reproduces the main symptoms of LF [46] . In this model, T cell-mediated immunopathology apparently plays an essential role in LF disease, highlighting the dual activity of the T-cell response during LF. More studies are required to determine whether an early T-cell response aids in LASV clearance, or whether a late and dysregulated T-cell response may actually contribute to the severity of LF. On the other hand, JUNV infection elicits a robust IFN-I response in both NHPs and guinea pigs [47, 48] . As observed in LF patients, neutralizing antibodies against LASV do not form in either surviving NHPs or guinea pigs during the acute phase of infection [45, 49] . In contrast, neutralizing antibodies that develop early in infection are critical for clearance of JUNV infection of guinea pigs [50] . MACV infection also induces a potent IFN response in NHPs [51] and guinea pigs [52] .

However, the immunopathology seen in vaccinatedchallenged animals also occurred in animals given vaccine without alum. In an effort to determine whether an adjuvant that induced a bias for a Th1-type response would protect and prevent the immunopathology, we initiated an experiment where the DI PBS suspended vaccine was adjuvanted with Freund's complete adjuvant, a Th1-type adjuvant. However, this experiment was aborted by the September, 2008, Hurricane Ike induced flood of Galveston, Texas. An experiment with a SARS-CoV whole virus vaccine with and without GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) adjuvant ASO1 in hamsters has been reported [25] . This adjuvant is thought to induce Th1-type immune responses [49] . The authors indicate no lung immunopathology was seen among animals after challenge, including the group given vaccine without adjuvant; however, whether the hamster model could develop a Th2-type immunopathology is uncertain. Finally, a number of other studies of vaccines in animal model systems have been reported but presence or absence of immunopathology after challenge was not reported. A summary of the SARS-CoV vaccine evaluations in animal models (including the current report) that indicated an evaluation for immunopathology after challenge is presented in Table 2 . As noted all vaccines containing S protein induced protection against infection while the studies with VEE and vaccinia vector containing the N protein gene only did not. Also shown is that a Th2-type immunopathology was seen after challenge of all vaccinated animals when evaluation for immunopathology was reported except the study in hamsters with a GSK whole virus vaccine. Thus, inactivated whole virus vaccines whether inactivated with formalin or beta propiolactone and whether given with our without alum adjuvant exhibited a Th2-type immunopathologic in lungs after challenge. As indicated, two reports attributed the immunopathology to presence of the N protein in the vaccine; however, we found the same immunopathologic reaction in animals given S protein vaccine only, although it appeared to be of lesser intensity. Thus, a Th2-type immunopathologic reaction on challenge of vaccinated animals has occurred in three of four animal models (not in hamsters) including two different inbred mouse strains with four different types of SARS-CoV vaccines with and without alum adjuvant. An inactivated vaccine preparation that does not induce this result in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates has not been reported.",27.941146588534014,11.265641090942884

Future studies in suitable animal models should carefully evaluate the distribution of the mRNA, expression of the encoded antigen in distant organs, potential safety risks, including local and systemic effects, toxic effects of new delivery systems, as well as the induction of self-reactive antibodies in humans. mRNA vaccines, like DNA vaccines, are able to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, encode any antigen of choice and allow a high degree of adaptability. In terms of manufacturing, both platforms allow production of different vaccines using the same established production process and facility. However, since the production process of mRNA is based on in vitro systems and does not require amplification in bacteria or cell cultures, manufacturing of mRNA vaccines is a comparably short and simple to monitor process. As mRNA vaccines do not interact with the host-cell DNA, they avoid the potential risk of genomic integration posed by DNAbased vaccines. Since mRNA vaccines represent a minimal vector containing the ORF encoding the antigen of choice flanked by specific regulatory elements, they do not induce anti-vector immunity as observed for certain viral vector-based platforms (171, 172) and therefore can be administered multiple times. Furthermore, mRNA vaccines can be administered by different routes using conventional needle-based injections and, unlike DNA vaccines, they do not require any additional administration device such as gene gun or electroporation. Therefore, mRNA vaccines offer a flexible one-for-all largescale, rapid and cost-effective manufacturing process with fast turnaround time. This is vital when facing a pandemic threat requiring a rapid response platform capable of producing protective vaccines in the short time-frame necessary to protect at-risk populations and have an early impact on the progression of an outbreak.",30.885928228868096,12.88949585793472

One of these proteins, SERP-1, is a potent inhibitor of both thrombolytic and thrombotic proteases and has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties in a wide range of animal models [36, 37] .

However, employing DNA as a basis for vaccination also implicates some disadvantages. A concern in this context is the long-term persistence of DNA plasmids upon injection. Indeed, DNA persistence was shown in various preclinical studies that demonstrated the presence of plasmid DNA for up to 2 years upon IM injection with low but detectable expression and immunogenicity in a mouse model (88) . According to the FDA, DNA persistence is not generally evident at ectopic sites in biodistribution and persistence studies, but remains detectable at the injection sites for periods exceeding 60 days 8 . Especially in the context of this long-term persistence, the presence of foreign genetic information in the nucleus of transfected cells poses the additional risk of genomic integration into the host's chromosomes and the resulting threat of mutagenesis and oncogenesis. Despite negative results in several studies focusing on detection of DNA integration events upon IM injection in small animal models, genomic integration events were detectable following electroporation in mice (89, 90) demonstrating that integration represents a small risk that nevertheless needs to be considered in systems with enhanced DNA uptake. The FDA recommends integration studies to be included whenever plasmid DNA exceeding 30,000 copies per µg of host DNA persists in any tissue by study termination. The WHO advises integration studies as part of the preclinical safety program of DNA vaccines 9 . In addition, injection of bacterial DNA, sensed by the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs, has been associated with safety concerns, such as the generation of antibodies against the injected DNA. However, no anti-DNA antibodies have been detectable in mice, rats, rabbits or non-human primates (90) . Potential expression of the antibiotic resistance marker in vaccinated organisms has likewise raised safety concerns that are met by the replacement of these markers in next generation DNA vaccines. Lastly, expression of cytokines or co-stimulatory molecules that are used to enhance DNA immunogenicity might lead to unintended adverse effects upon cytokine expression and release such as generalized immune suppression, chronic inflammation or autoimmunity. The WHO recommends monitoring the persistence of a cytokine expressing plasmid as well as appropriate preclinical models, such as animal models responsive to the respective human cytokine to ensure vaccine safety.",22.112201288678225,10.037750580279322

The entry of filoviruses into target cells is the first essential step in the viral life cycle, and the viral and cellular factors involved in this process are potential targets for antiviral strategies.

Consequently, defining which domains in GP are essential for cellular entry and can be targeted by the humoral immune response is pivotal to the design of effective vaccines. In addition, insights into the multiple, sequential interactions of GP with host cell factors required for cellular entry can define novel targets for therapeutic inhibition.

Among the first approaches was a format, whose two components, free and protamine-complexed mRNA (a small arginine-rich nuclear protein that stabilizes nucleic acids), provide both strong antigen expression and immunostimulation (147) (148) (149) (150) . This vaccine format has proved to be immunogenic and capable of inducting protection against lethal challenge infections with influenza or rabies virus in several animal models (124, 151) . Using this format, CV7201, a candidate vaccine against rabies, was investigated as the first ever prophylactic mRNA-based vaccine in healthy human volunteers. The subjects received 80-640 µg of the mRNA vaccine three times by conventional needle-based injection or needle-free injection devices via the intradermal (ID) or intramuscular (IM) route. The vaccine was generally safe with a reasonable tolerability profile and led to the induction of neutralizing antibody titers at levels of 0·5 IU/mL or higher (as the correlate of protection) in 71% of subjects who had received ID injections of 80 or 160 µg mRNA vaccines by needle-free intradermal injection, while needle-based injection was ineffective (152) . Antibody responses waned one year after first vaccination but could be boosted to 0·5 IU/mL or higher in 57% of subjects using 80 µg of mRNA delivered ID with a needle free injection device, indicating the induction of B cell memory responses.

However, this initial optimism was dampened by continual setbacks faced over the years. Some of the major obstacles included the vast genetic variability of HIV, arising from the absence of a proof-reading mechanism in RT that allows mutations to happen rapidly during the replication cycle. Absence of a suitable animal model has also been a major hindrance in vaccine development efforts, with the chimpanzee model being far from ideal. Moreover, there are no clear correlates of protection, necessitating Phase III human clinical trials in order to establish the efficacy of a vaccine.",28.151731208673354,13.272199519970947

Of these, the nasal route is the most straightforward and is suitable for vaccine administration. Advantages and disadvantages of nasal vaccination are summarized in Table 1 . The prime inductive site for mucosal immunity in the nasopharyngeal tract in rodents is the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) [7] [8] [9] . NALT is considered the rodent equivalent of Waldeyer's ring (Fig. 1) , the lymphoid tissues (tonsils) present in humans [10] . Waldeyer's ring forms a protective site at the opening of the pharynx to provide immunity [11] . Protection at this mucosal surface is correlated with secretory immunoglobulin-A (sIgA) antibodies which, alongside other innate defence mechanisms, provide additional protection from pathogens [12] . Murine NALT is a functional analogue to human tonsils, and animal research has provided insight into human immunology. Such studies are essential before any human trials of vaccine candidates. However, human immunity and biological composition can differ from those of animal models. For nasal vaccine development, development of appropriate in vitro models has provided a reproducible approach in which phenotypic and physiological features of the NALT can be simulated [13] .

Such safety concerns have forced vaccine makers to shift their focus to subunit vaccines, composed of nucleic acids, recombinant proteins, or short peptide sequences, which favor safety over efficacy and may thus require additional immune stimulating agents, known as adjuvants [4] .

The common mucosal immune system has been studied quite extensively in rodent models but less so in large animal models such as the pig. Reasons for this paucity of reported induction of the common mucosal immune system in this species may be that distal mucosal sites were examined but no induction was observed and therefore it was not reported. However, we suspect that the majority of investigators simply did not sample distal mucosal sites and therefore there is little evidence of immune response induction in the literature. It is our hope that more pig immunologists and infectious disease experts who perform mucosal immunizations or inoculations on pigs will sample distal mucosal sites and report their findings, whether results are positive or negative. In this review, we highlight papers that show that immunization/inoculation using one route triggers mucosal immune system induction locally, systemically, and within at least one distal mucosal site.

However, rats are rarely used in nonclinical pharmacology studies that are focused on protective or therapeutic immune responses to a vaccine candidate. Instead, mice, rabbits and/or nonhuman primates (NHPs) are typical species in vaccine pharmacology studies based on available models of diseases and attempts to predict immune responses from animals to humans. In order to ""bridge"" the toxicology and pharmacology animal species, a measurement of immune responses in species selected for nonclinical safety evaluation (e.g., rats) to a vaccine candidate is included in a separate study or within a repeat-dose toxicity study [ 39 ] . This approach provides indirect evidence of the exposure and activity of the vaccine and is aligned with the general principle of all toxicology studies, in which the demonstration of the animal exposure to a test article following the administration of this test article in the course of a study is required. However, based on recent discussions and some regulatory guidelines [ 6 ] , there are additional expectations (if not requirements) for toxicology studies of vaccines, that is, the animal species should be sensitive to the pathogenic organism or toxin targeted by the vaccine-induced immune response. Addressing this expectation in toxicology studies may be problematic when the ""disease-sensitive species"" are different from the ""routine species"" because the former are not well characterized to provide reliable data to distinguish between ""background"" lesions relative to what may be considered a vaccine-related effect. Typically, a solution to this problem would involve the use of more than one species to evaluate safety of such vaccine candidate; for example, using a routine species in a well-controlled toxicity study (i.e., compliant with Good Laboratory Practice regulation) and a nonroutine species in an exploratory safety study, which is likely less comprehensive but with endpoints focused on pathogen-speci fi c concerns [ 23 ] . In both types of studies, the immune response to the vaccine should be demonstrated. The evaluation of the immune response to the vaccine relies on immunoassays that are developed in order to measure the most relevant endpoint, i.e. antibody response or cellular immune response. For the measure of speci fi c antibodies, standard ELISA formats or multiplex assays for multiple antigens vaccine candidates are often applied [ 40 ] . When the candidate vaccine targets the cellular arm of the immune response, assays measuring cytokine-secreting antigen-speci fi c T lymphocytes (such as g -interferon ELISpot) can be utilized [ 41 ] .

As mentioned earlier, there are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines. In addition, many technologies used (production platforms, vectors, etc.) are new and need to be tested thoroughly for safety. The target for the vaccine, the S protein, has been identified, and vaccine candidates are being generated. This is usually followed by two important steps that are typically needed before bringing a vaccine into clinical trials. First, the vaccine is tested in appropriate animal models to see whether it is protective. However, animal models for SARS-CoV-2 might be difficult to develop. The virus does not grow in wild-type mice and only induced mild disease in transgenic animals expressing human ACE2 (Bao et al., 2020) . Other potential animal models include ferrets and NHPs, for which pathogenicity studies are ongoing. Even in the absence of an animal model that replicates human disease, it is possible to evaluate the vaccine because serum from vaccinated animals can be tested in in vitro neutralization assays. Post-challenge safety data should also be collected in these cases to assess for complications such as the ones seen SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV vaccines. Second, vaccines need to be tested for toxicity in animals, e.g., in rabbits. Usually, viral challenge is not part of this process, because only the safety of the vaccine will be evaluated. This testing, which has to be performed in a manner compliant with GLP (Good Laboratory Practice), typically takes 3-6 months to complete. For some vaccine platforms, parts of the safety testing might be skipped if there is already sufficient data available for similar vaccines made in the same production process. Vaccines for human use are produced in processes that comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) to ensure constant quality and safety of vaccines. This requires dedicated facilities, trained personnel, proper documentation, and raw material that was produced to be of cGMP quality. These processes have to be designed or amended to fit SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Although not scientifically proved, these concerns should persist until evidence proves otherwise. A possible mechanism of vaccine-associated autoimmunity is epitope mimicry, in which an antigen in a vaccine is similar to a self-antigen, causing the immune response to be directed at an antigen on a population of the animal's cells. Certain types of adjuvant can stimulate different pathways of the immune response and some vaccines may stimulate differentiation of pathogenic lymphocytes that recognize selfantigens. It has been shown that all adult humans have some B and T cell lymphocytes that recognize self-antigens; however, these cells are typically quiescent. With some vaccinations, these cells could become reactive or overreactive, resulting in autoimmunity. Because neonates often have a reduced immune response, it is thought they may be more protected from autoimmune reactions.

These include neutralization tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), and others. Well-validated reagents are needed as reference standards for essential laboratory tests as polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, and PCR primer pairs. One of the most sensitive issues was how to select an appropriate animal model to evaluate the candidate vaccines. For example, we observed that NMRI mice gave a very heterogeneous response whereas Balb-C or C57BL/6J mice responded uniformly to immunization with the vaccine candidate. Also, guinea pigs appeared to be a good model for the evaluation of immune responses. Beyond immunogenicity, it is important to work with an animal model that is appropriate for challenge studies, as an assessment of vaccine efficacy.

The epitope-driven vaccine is an attractive concept that is being successfully pursued in a large number of research groups, especially to the design of vaccines targeting conserved epitopes in rapidly mutating pathogens [13] . Studies show that using epitope prediction methods in combination with molecular docking technique improves the prediction accuracy significantly. Molecular docking is applied in order to measure free-binding energy of selected epitopes. Freebinding energy depends on the conformation of the protein the ligand and before and after binding. The specific cellular immune response is based on the recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes of immunogenic peptides presented in the context of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Due to the important and central role of the T lymphocyte in the immune response, the molecular basis of the interaction between the peptide-MHC (p-MHC) complex and the T cell receptor (TCR) is of general interest for medicine immunology, as well as for understanding the factors that contribute to stability and specificity in the formation of protein-protein and protein-peptide complexes [14] .

However, the need for extensive safety testing of such vaccines can delay entry of such candidate vaccines into clinical trials. Multiple studies have reported that antibodies directed against the spike (S) glycoprotein can neutralise SARS-CoV infectivity [6] [7] [8] [9] .

Engineered animal models are proving invaluable to pharmaceutical research since small animal models of disease may be created and validated to mimic a disease in human patients. Mouse, rat, and zebra fi sh are the most common models explored and used. Genetic engineering can predispose an animal to a particular disease under scrutiny, and the insertion of human genes into the animal can initiate the development of a more clinically relevant disease condition. In human clinical studies, assessments of effi cacy and safety often rely on measured effects for surrogate biomarkers and adverse event reporting. Validated transgenic animal models of human disease allow for parallel study and possible predictability prior to entering clinical trials. Also, it is possible to screen potential drug candidates in vivo against a human receptor target inserted into an animal model.

We found that CV-B3 NtAb positivity in adults were very high. We compared the pseudovirus assay with CPE assay, which is referred as a gold standard assay for the detection of anti-enterovirus NtAbs. Although improvement on specificity was needed in the future, this pseudovirus based assay provided a superior replacement for anti-CV-B5 NtAbs detection. Development of antiserum reference standard for CV-B5 would help to optimize this pseudovirus assay, so that proper cutoff value to achieve the highest Youden's index could be set to produce the best balance of overall agreement, sensitivity, and specificity with respect to the reference CPE assay. To date, we had established pseudovirus based NtAbs quantification assay for EV-A71, CV-A16, CV-B3, and CV-B5. Following the successful licensure of EV-A71 vaccine in China, changes in HFMD pathogen spectrum have been noticed and multivalent vaccines against more health threatening enteroviruses co-circulating in HFMD epidemics have been proposed to be ideally for HFMD control (Klein and Chong, 2015; Mao et al., 2016) . There are challenges in many aspects of multivalent vaccine development, e.g. selection of potential vaccine strains (Klein and Chong, 2015) . Further, safe, convenient and robust bioassays as well as animal models for efficacy evaluation are necessarily required. These aforementioned pseudovirus-based NtAbs quantification assays for HFMD associated enteroviruses could be used for evaluation of vaccine induced humoral immune response. Establishment of reference standards like antiserum standards for measuring vaccine-induced NtAb titers is also an important part for bioassay development (Cooper et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, a new EV-A71 infection mouse model had been successfully established based on EV-A71 pseudovirus, which also showed impressive advantages in efficacy evaluation of EV-A71 vaccine .Thus, introduction of enteroviruse pseudoviruses (e.g. CV-A16, CV-B3 and CV-B5) to mouse infection models would also greatly facilitate the development of multivalent vaccine for HFMD.",25.917755665690272,11.930001965968508

A Review,"Unfortunately, relative phylogenetic closeness is not always a useful aid in vaccine development; for example, despite that the pathogenesis of SARS had been well characterized, much of this knowledge was not applicable to the MERS virus (Maslow 2017) . It was known that SARS infects cells by binding to an enzyme widely expressed in mammals (i.e., the angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Wong et al. 2004 ). Because of this, murine and other mammalian animals were readily used as models to test candidate vaccines against SARS. On the other hand, however, the MERS virus binds to the cell surface dipeptidylpeptidase 4, in which the receptor binding domain differs between susceptible and nonsusceptible species (Li et al. 2003) . MERS is restricted to primates, camelids, and bats. For this reason, rodents were not useful models, whereas camels, alpacas, and primates did develop infection (Crameri et al. 2016) but are expensive models for vaccine testing. These kind of difficulties can delay the development of vaccines against emerging diseases. Also, the lack of data on immunogenicity, dosing, and safety can hinder progress (Røttingen et al. 2017) .

The primary mediating hormone appears to be CORT. Stressors that cause a prolonged increase in CORT, such as prolonged restraint, suppress the ability of DCs to process and present antigen, and stressors that induce DC resistance to CORT, such as social stress, increase the ability of DCs to process and present antigen. These effects on the DC significantly affect the development of antigen-specific memory T cells, and although less well studied, are also likely to affect the antibody response to vaccines.

The ideal animal model for human viral disease should closely recapitulate the spectrum of clinical symptoms and pathogenesis observed during the course of human infection. Whenever feasible, the model should use the same virus and strain that infects humans. It is also preferable that the virus is a low passage clinical isolate thus animal passage or adaptation should be avoided if model species can be identified that are susceptible. Ideally, the experimental route of infection would mirror that occurs in natural disease. In order to understand the interplay and contribution of the immune system during infection, an immunocompetent animal should be used.

Vaccines have been developed against IBV, TGEV, CCoV, and FIPV. However, these vaccines do not seem to provide complete protection from wild-type virus infection. In some cases, the wild-type CoV rapidly evolves to escape neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies. In studies of vaccinated chickens, a live-attenuated IBV vaccine has been shown to undergo RNA recombination with wild-type virus to generate vaccine escape mutants. Killed virus vaccines may also be problematic for some CoV infections. Vaccination of cats with a killed FIPV vaccine has been shown to exacerbate disease when cats are challenged with wild-type virus. Therefore, extensive studies will be required to carefully evaluate candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. A variety of approaches are currently under investigation for developing CoV vaccines, including analysis of killed virus vaccines, live-attenuated virus vaccines, and viral vector vaccines (such as modified vaccine virus Ankara, canarypox, alphavirus, and adenovirus vectors). Studies have shown that removing the envelope (E) protein from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV is an effective approach for generating a live attenuated virus vaccine. In the absence of this structural protein, the virus replicates to lower titers in the lungs of mice, but still induces an immune response that is protective from challenge with wild type virus. The development of improved animal models for human coronaviruses will be essential for evaluating any candidate vaccines. Transgenic mice expressing human ACE-2 (for SARS-CoV) can be used as a model system for SARS, however the pathogenesis in ACE-2 expressing transgenic mice does not fully mimic the pathogenesis seen during SARS-CoV infection in humans. CoVs can be adapted for replication in small animal models.

This primary response must not be confused with the animal having been immunized. A subsequent dose of vaccine (exposure) will lead to immunologic memory. Subsequent exposures to the same antigen elicit a stronger response: a greater amount of antibody is produced and the subsequent response is more rapid. This process is known as the secondary or anamnestic immune response, which results in immunity.

Thanks to vaccination some diseases have been eradicated and mortality due to infectious diseases has been significantly reduced. However, there are still many infections that are not preventable with vaccination, which represent a major cause of mortality worldwide. Some of these infections are caused by pathogens with a high degree of antigen variability that cannot be controlled only by antibodies, but require a mix of humoral and cellular immune responses. Novel technologies for antigen discovery, expression and formulation allow now for the development of vaccines that can better cope with pathogen diversity and trigger multifunctional immune responses. In addition, the application of new genomic assays and systems biology approaches in human immunology can help to better identify vaccine correlates of protection. The availability of novel vaccine technologies, together with the knowledge of the distinct human immune responses that are required to prevent different types of infection, should help to rationally design effective vaccines where conventional approaches have failed.",26.958895102377035,13.091582941345724

For some diseases affecting both livestock and humans there is a clear commercial incentive to develop vaccine products (Framework I vaccines) ( Table 2) . However, such development efforts are generally segregated in the animal and human health divisions in industry and academia, and have separate regulatory pathways. This results in a potential waste of resources and duplicated scientific endeavors. Interestingly, when one company (Akso Nobel), an animal health company, decided in 2003 on a strategic move into human vaccine development, it drew on its veterinary scientists to staff the program. As pointed out in this review, there have been isolated successful examples, e.g. a West Nile vaccine, of co-development of a vaccine for both veterinary and human indications, an obviously efficient strategy that broadened both the commercial and public health opportunity. Future efforts along similar lines should be considered on a case by case basis, depending on medical need, but in general there is value in closer connections between human and veterinary vaccines and regulatory science, and in the application of domesticated animals as models for development of infectious disease and cancer vaccines.

Many PCR and serologic diagnostic kits are available, and other diagnostic tools are under development [16] . Existing [17] reported that real-time PCR, coupled with an improved RNA extraction method, allows detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates with 80% specificity, a considerable improvement over first-generation procedures. This research was made possible by the availability of a set of well-characterized clinical samples from individuals with confirmed SARS, coupled with matched controls. Rigorous testing of diagnostic procedures using standardized samples remains a challenge to the international community, however. In addition, a more complete understanding of where in the body the virus can be found at different stages of the disease might lead to new diagnostic strategies. For example, the report that SARS CoV can replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in individuals with SARS shortly after the onset of symptoms indicates that blood might be an appropriate clinical specimen for diagnosis [18, 19] . Availability of a highly accurate and specific diagnostic assay that could detect SARS CoV before or shortly after the onset of symptoms would be a tremendously valuable public health tool in any future SARS outbreaks [20] . SARS pathogenesis and immune response. A complete understanding of SARS pathogenesis, together with a full picture of the human immune response, has not yet been achieved. In this regard, it is particularly important to understand what role, if any, the human immune response plays in severe disease outcomes. A recent report describing changes in cytokine concentrations in 61 patients seropositive for SARS CoV in Beijing at early, peak, and recovery stages of the disease indicates that the immune system responds abnormally to the virus [21] . This is the kind of study that can provide useful insights into both pathogenic mechanisms and the effectiveness of experimental therapies. Another report indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for SARS CoV [22] . Further work to systematically unravel all aspects of how SARS CoV interacts with its human host at the molecular and physiologic levels will help ensure rapid development of therapeutic techniques, diagnostic assays, and vaccines. SARS animal models. It has been shown that the virus will replicate in several small animals, including masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, mice, domestic cats, and nonhuman primates; researchers have a variety of animal models from which to choose. The development of vaccines and therapeutic strategies will rely on several different models, because each will have advantages in different experimental settings. However, no animal model described to date can reliably mimic the respiratory symptoms seen in humans with SARS. A recent report indicates that SARS-infected ferrets become ill, although these animals show no evidence of pneumonia [23] .

Since the first smallpox vaccine by Jenner, numerous different approaches for vaccination have been developed. Traditionally vaccine formulations are divided in two major classes, live and inactivated (Table 1) . Live vaccines contain attenuated or non-pathogenic strain of a pathogen or an expression vector. Such a vaccine is unable to induce disease but is able to induce suitable immunity; over-attenuation is a potential risk a vaccine scientist has to be aware of. It is the challenge for the vaccine developer to find the right balance between the virulence of the vaccine virus and its ability to replicate sufficiently in order to induce immunity. Attenuation can be achieved by many different ways (some examples are given in Table 1 ). For this, approaches used have been passaging of a pathogen in cell cultures, derivation and/or isolation of temperature sensitive mutants, which are restricted for significant replication in internal body organs. The use of related apathogenic strain by Jenner is yet another example. More modern methodology would involve the use of molecular biological techniques to remove virulence genes from a pathogen or to engineer non-pathogenic, replicating agents to express immunity inducing antigenic epitopes of a pathogen. Replication-defective vectors have also been developed as safe effective vaccines for some viral diseases. Live vaccines generally induce both Th1 and Th2 immune response and have been used in situations where antibody responses are not correlated with protection or where existing circulating antibody interferes with the induction of immunological response; interference due to maternally derived antibody (MDA) in un-weaned host is a common problem, particularly for killed vaccines administered parenterally. For many viral diseases, killed or inactivated vaccines have been widely used as a safe option. Killed vaccines generally induce humoral immune responses and often require the use of adjuvants to boost the immune response. Adjuvants can play a major role in the direction of the immune response. Aluminium hydroxide for instance is a strong inducer of humoral immune responses, whereas others such as saponins and derivatives may induce cellular responses as well [ [2] , and references therein]. As is the case with live vaccines, different inactivated vaccine formulations are known, such as inactivated whole virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, peptide vaccines, and split virion vaccines.",29.054414870221745,11.526340047178433

Even though a range of animal models are used for the evaluation of vaccines, results from immunogenicity studies in these models should be interpreted with caution. Although their functions may be similar, the MHC of mice, rodents, and non-human primates differ from human MHC (known as HLA in the context of human immune response) at the amino acid level and these differences effect which epitopes can be presented. This helps to explain why different strains of mice (Balb/C, C57Bl/6) have different immune responses to pathogens as well as vaccines for those pathogens (Klitgaard et al. 2006) .

Manufacturing a candidate vaccine for which there is no immediate market poses a significant dilemma because most stages of advanced vaccine development are carried out by large pharmaceutical companies that need to make profit to stay in business. While emerging infectious diseases pose a public health threat, they rarely present a compelling commercial opportunity. Vaccines require a large investment and historically have a relatively low probability of being successful without an extensive iterative process of evaluation and redesign. Therefore, in addition to new biological tools, there needs to be political will to prioritize public funding of advanced vaccine development and new business models for managing this process. 3 In this review, we describe the vaccine development efforts for three distinct viruses that collectively capture many of the challenges faced when developing vaccines for emerging viral threats.

It has been theorized that effective vaccines can be developed using the minimum essential subset of T cell and B cell epitopes that comprise the 'immunome.' Researchers are therefore using bioinformatics sequence analysis tools, epitope-mapping tools, microarrays, and high-throughput immunology assays to discover the minimal essential components of the immunome. When these minimal components, or epitopes, are packaged with adjuvants in an appropriate delivery vehicle, the complete package comprises an epitopebased immunome-derived vaccine. Such vaccines may have a significant advantage over conventional vaccines, as the careful selection of the components may diminish undesired side effects such as have been observed with whole pathogen and protein subunit vaccines. This chapter will review the pre-clinical and anticipated clinical development of computer-driven vaccine design and the validation of epitope-based immunome-derived vaccines in animal models; it will also include an overview of heterologous immunity and other emerging issues that will need to be addressed by vaccines of all types in the future.",29.388816880285113,11.954104374333996

The major factors that need to be addressed include (1) the political will to provide the resources necessary to conduct the epidemiology and laboratory work needed to support vaccine development, (2) new business models to create an infrastructure for advanced vaccine development that does not require profit motive, and (3) creative regulatory processes and clinical trial designs to evaluate products for efficacy during outbreaks that are by nature sporadic and causing social chaos. Importantly, achieving solid efficacy data that can support licensure is critical so products can be more readily available during future epidemics. Novel approaches to vaccine design may significantly shorten vaccine development timelines and increase the frequency of success. New technologies that have rapidly evolved over the last 5-10 years make atomic level antigen design feasible and provide mechanisms for rapid, iterative improvements in antigenicity and immunogenicity of candidate vaccines. In particular, high throughput sequencing provides a starting point for vaccine antigens and helps to define the extent of genetic variability. Relatively inexpensive gene synthesis, the ease of isolating and characterizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against target antigens, the ability to define structures of vaccine antigens in complex with mAbs with desirable functional properties, and the development of assays that evaluate immunogenicity of vaccines in animal models, provide the foundation for rapid development of highly characterized candidate vaccines and their advancement into clinical evaluation. The figure illustrates the steps taken in the case of MERS CoV to rapidly develop the tools needed to generate candidate vaccines. Advanced knowledge of effective vaccine approaches for a particular virus family together with these modern development and design approaches may significantly shorten the time needed to prepare vaccines for field testing in the setting of a new pandemic threat.",31.142064333567774,11.174836060989314

However, since October 2001 when anthrax spores were sent in envelopes through the US Postal Service, our understanding of biodefense has shifted significantly. We now see biodefense as the process to protect both civilian and military populations. It has become clear that many highly pathogenic microorganisms can be considered as either agents of biological warfare or naturally occurring emerging disease threats. In addition, we consider bioterrorism from varying points of view, including public health threats, veterinary threats, and agricultural threats. Taken together, they can be considered to be ""biothreats"". The biodefense field represents a unique challenge for vaccine development as the traditional economic models for vaccine development are based on large populations purchasing a vaccine to protect against common infectious diseases in order that a vaccine pharma can make a profit. The situation in biodefense is very different where the goal is to stockpile vaccines with the hope that they will never be used. Relatively small markets, combined with the difficulties of working with many of these agents-many of which require biosafety level 3 or 4 containment-means that there are currently no vaccines licensed for general use in the United States and most other countries for nearly all of the biothreat agents. There are major hurdles to the development of biodefense vaccines. In addition to the traditional issues of identifying protective immunogens and platforms to deliver the vaccines, there are major difficulties in undertaking efficacy studies as most of the diseases are rare, occur sporadically, or are not found naturally. Accordingly, emphasis is being placed on appropriate animal models to demonstrate efficacy in support of licensure. However, at this time, no vaccine has been approved based on animal efficacy trials only. Nonetheless, a significant amount of data are being accumulated describing the molecular basis of disease, which provides a strong foundation for continuing product development. The current state of biodefense vaccines in clinical development is summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 : Current status of vaccines in clinical trials against priority pathogens and potential biothreat agents. Data for the table come from http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ and other sources as indicated. Many vaccines are in preclinical development, including a number of candidate vaccines for Lassa virus [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and Sin Nombre [7, 8] The advent of the 21st century has seen our expertise in molecular biology increase exponentially. With the increasing affordability of high-throughput sequencing, concepts such as reverse vaccinology-using pathogen genome sequences to produce peptides and nucleic acids for vaccine testing-have become more established [11, 12] . As our understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenesis continues to grow, coupled with large numbers of genome sequences for various pathogens becoming available and novel bioinformatics tools to facilitate their analysis, we are heading towards a position where vaccines can be rationally designed based on our molecular knowledge. This includes selection of an optimum immunogen and delivery system to maximize the host protective immune response rather than empirical approaches that were used for much of the 20th century. The continuing generation of high-throughput datasets characterizing high-priority biodefense and public health pathogens, and their host responses in the postgenomic era, will require novel bioinformatic techniques. These computational approaches will allow a more complete and thorough understanding of infection and pathogenesis, and greatly facilitate rational vaccine design. This review describes some of these methods and how they can be used in the development of novel vaccines against biothreat viruses.",27.862353115827748,13.104830430291909

Only a few nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection with HIV-1 and infected animals do not progress to AIDS. 56 Therefore, it is important to use other disease models that mimic the HIV-AIDS pathologic progression. 57 One such potential model is feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). FIV was discovered in 1986 and is known to cause an AIDS-like disease in domestic cats and mimics HIV-related dementia in humans. 58 A vaccine for FIV was approved by the FDA in 2002. 59 While the FIV model is potentially informative, its use is not sufficient as a basis for development of a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. An ideal animal model would display a pathological response to infection with HIV-1 that is very similar to the one that occurs in humans. Unfortunately, HIV-1 does not cause pathology leading to the development of AIDS in any host other than humans. [60] [61] [62] [63] However, animal models have been developed and used that allow partial understanding of the pathology of HIV-1, the natural immunological response to infection, and the response of the host to novel therapeutics. One of these models involves the simian immunodeficiency virus MAC (SIV MAC ) that replicates and causes an AIDS-like disease in baboons, cynomolgus, and pigtailed macaques. While the similarities of SIV MAC to HIV-1 have allowed for insight into pathology, transmission, and immunological response of the infected host to the virus, the differences between SIV MAC and HIV-1 are still too great to be able to draw conclusions regarding potential human responses to an HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine. 63 Therefore, to broaden the scope of animal model usage, a chimeric SHIV virus was engineered to incorporate both SIV and HIV-1 proteins or genes. 64 While macaques infected with SHIV do go on to develop AIDS, the time to progression is much different from the time to progression to AIDS of HIV-1-infected humans. Infection of macaques with SIV mac 251 strain mimics HIV-1 infection in humans by leading to chronic, slow disease progression. Route and dose required for infection, viral tropism, replicative capacity of the viruses, and pathology of SIV/SHIV-infected monkeys are all very different than these parameters in humans. 65, 66 This distinction has been well characterized by the recent Phase IIb STEP trial, which involved 3000 healthy, uninfected volunteers. The result of this trial was termination at its first scheduled efficacy assessment due to its failure to suppress viral load in subsequently infected individuals and then-suspected increased HIV-1 infection due to interaction of the immune system with vaccine components. 67 The vaccine, a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) virus incorporating the gag, pol, and nef genes from HIV-1, had been previously tested in an SHIV model in macaques and the results of that experiment were not suggestive of the results of the human trial. 68 This disparity underscores the need for animal models that more closely reflect the pathology seen in human infection with HIV-1 as well as identification of immunological correlates of protection that reflect control of HIV-1 viral load in human subjects. Therefore, the search for an appropriate animal model or the appropriate use of current animal models in the search for a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine continues. Until a model can be derived that will allow for observation of each stage of infection, progression of disease, and response of the immune system in a way that is comparable to this process in humans, we will not be able to logically predict which vaccine candidates should be moved forward to clinical trials.",32.64336491006074,12.999765573264263

These infections often serve as highly useful models of disease. For instance, MHV-1 causes severe respiratory disease in susceptible A/J and C3H/HeJ mice, A59 and MHV-3 induce severe hepatitis, while JHMV causes severe encephalitis. Interestingly, MHV-3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade [ 68 ] . Most notably, A59 and attenuated versions of JHMV cause a chronic demyelinating disease that bears similarities to multiple sclerosis (MS), making MHV infection one of the best models for this debilitating human disease. Early studies suggested that demyelination was dependent on viral replication in oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord [ 69 , 70 ] ; however, more recent reports clearly demonstrate that the disease is immune-mediated. Irradiated mice or immunodefi cient (lacking T and B cells) mice do not develop demyelination, but addition of virus-specifi c T cells restores the development of demyelination [ 71 , 72 ] . Additionally, demyelination is accompanied by a large infl ux of macrophages and microglia that can phagocytose infected myelin [ 73 ] , although it is unknown what the signals are that direct immune cells to destroy myelin. Finally, MHV can be studied under BSL2 laboratory conditions, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, which require a BSL3 laboratory, and provides a large number of suitable animal models. These factors make MHV an ideal model for studying the basics of viral replication in tissue culture cells as well as for studying the pathogenesis and immune response to coronaviruses.",28.788459319613963,12.512176430781588

Microarray studies characterizing the global host responses to the adjuvants alum, CpG, MF59, and LTK63 have identified transcript signatures common between and specific to these adjuvants [71, 72] . By understanding how these transcriptional responses correlate with the development of specific immune mechanisms, appropriate pathways could be stimulated with specific vaccines to induce the appropriate immune effector functions for that pathogen: as efforts to design vaccines to be as safe as possible continue, a potential side effect could be overattenuation leading to increased safety at the expense of immunogenicity and lasting protection. A possible solution could be the use of novel adjuvants to stimulate the signaling pathways associated with a strong immunogenic response. As an example, inflammasome activation was found to be a central regulator of the immune response to yellow fever vaccine [69] . Interestingly, a novel nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery method has recently been reported which includes lipopolysaccharide to activate the inflammasome alongside delivery of a protein subunit vaccine [73] . Combining findings such as these will be central to future themes of vaccinology.

Moreover, the characteristics and conditions that make an antibody protective against EBOV in animal models and/or in humans are not fully understood. Furthermore, the protective ability of a specific mAb in one animal model does not necessarily imply that it provides protection in another animal model. Nacayama and Saijo (2013) have comprehensively reviewed the different animal models used to study EBOV infection, mainly rodents and non-human primates (NHP), and have summarized their strengths and weaknesses. NHP, particularly rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, better mimic EBOV infection in humans and more closely reproduce the symptoms of the disease than do rodents. However, the use of NHP presents researchers with more significant practical and ethical hurdles (Nacayama and Saijo, 2013; Geisbert et al., 2015) than does the use of rodents. Different rodent models have been developed to do EBOV research, including some knockout variants (Brannan et al., 2015) . The practicality of using rodents in the laboratory and the possibility of using genetically modified animals has made them an attractive model with which to study the protective effect of anti-EBOV therapies and vaccines. However, the EBOV has to be adapted to cause lethal infection in rodents, which represents a highly restrictive situation given the high risk presented by handling a BSL-4 pathogen, such as EBOV. Moreover, some widely used rodents, such as mice and guinea pigs, do not exhibit some of the distinctive symptoms of EBOV in primates, such as fever and rash, which further suggests dissimilarities between the anti-EBOV immune response in rodents and primates. In general, anti-EBOV protection in rodents is not a conclusive indicator of protection in humans. Probably the best example of this is the case of mAb KZ52, which is neutralizing and protective in rodents but not in NHPs. In the particular case of anti-EBOV mAb therapies, NHP studies appear to be a mandatory step in predicting efficacy in humans. However, no clear correlation can be established between therapeutic effectiveness in NHPs and humans due to the limited amount of clinical data in humans.",30.064104138781346,11.397564500212074

Currently, the number of approved vaccine adjuvant-delivery systems for human use is limited, but the development of nanotechnology has sparked remarkable progress in nanoparticle-based vaccine development. This includes the use of immune adjuvant and antigen delivery systems aiming at a slow controlled release that allows single-injection vaccine formulations or even a needle-free mucosal vaccine as the ultimate goal for improving the quality of life of people. The application of well-defined nanoparticles to peptide-based subunit vaccines offers many advantages and has significant potential for the development of next-generation vaccines. From both a manufacturing and a preservation perspective, highly pure synthetic peptide antigens containing self-assembling sequences or lipid moieties are of exceptional interest, as they can be easily produced by SPPS and lyophilized to an amorphous form that is suitable for stable storage and medical use. Furthermore, peptides with the capability for self-assembly can form nanoparticles whenever required. Animal immunization studies have already demonstrated the utility of nanoparticle-based peptide subunit vaccines for induction of the desired immune response (cytokine productions, recruitment of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, and cellular and/or humoral responses).

Rather than acting directly through a well-defined, single ligand-receptor interaction, vaccine antigens and adjuvants have a series of complex interactions with multiple components of the immune system at or near the site of immunization and sometimes at systemic sites as well. These interactions prime the host for an anamnestic response to a subsequent infectious challenge, often at another anatomic site in the host, at a time remote from the immunization. The antigens in the viral challenge may have differences from those in the vaccine. In some cases, the host may have experienced infection with an antigenically related virus prior to immunization, adding an additional element of complexity to the vaccine immune response. The complex immunology that underlies protection from disease by immunization makes it a fascinating subject for scientific investigation. However, for practical vaccine development, straightforward, definitive, easily executed, reproducible, and readily interpreted immunological assays are needed to characterize and define the response to vaccines more fully. The intersection between the rich complexity of vaccine immunology and the practical need for simplicity in regulatory science contributes to a gap between the science and practice of vaccinology.",36.37962873233529,16.471510495827697

Furthermore, the need for new, high-performance vaccine platforms has prompted the development of nucleic acid-based technologies (viral vectors, plasmid DNA, conventional RNA, or self-amplifying RNA [SAM]), which are able to elicit broadly protective and robust cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, since expression of the vaccine antigens occurs in situ. Generally, RNA and SAM vaccines have proven more potent than plasmid DNA vaccines, and their production and purification is cost-effective, relatively versatile and readily transferable between different viral targets [48, 49] . Besides influenza vaccines, RNA and SAM vaccines targeting several other pathogens such as HIV and RSV have been evaluated, and were shown to confer protection in animal models [50, 51] . Some of these vaccines, including those against influenza and rabies, have also been tested in clinical trials, with promising but not yet satisfactory results [52, 53] .

Studies in the mouse model have suggested that vaccine responses may be compromised in these age groups. The development of the murine immune system may not provide an appropriate model for evaluating immune responses in these two age groups. To evaluate vaccine immune responses in the neonate, and to address questions regarding possible interactions between vaccines and maternal antibodies, large-animal models may be much more appropriate [172−174] . However, other than mice, there have been very few investigations of vaccine responses in geriatric animals [175, 176] .

Disease protection against a wide variety of pathogens that invade through mucosal surfaces could be achieved by mucosal vaccination. Difficulties associated with efficient vaccine delivery and weak immune responses following mucosal immunization made the induction of protective immune responses at mucosal surfaces an elusive goal. Thus for the evaluation of mucosal vaccine-delivery technologies, effective and safe mucosal adjuvants, and the characterization of mucosal immune responses, an appropriate animal model is required. In mice, intranasal vaccination may be associated with inhalation and ingestion of vaccine antigens. This makes it difficult to discriminate between intranasal, oral, and intrapulmonary vaccination. However, larger animals like the pig or the cow can be used for the controlled delivery of vaccines to the nasal passages [178, 179] . The nasal passages of these animals more closely resemble that of humans than do those of the mouse.

Characterising the human immune response to infection is essential for identifying correlates of protection and for developing suitable animal models for vaccine development; an important component of this work is the collection of blood from survivors. Collection of appropriate volumes of antibodyrich serum from survivors are essential for the international standards and assays that are needed for vaccine (and diagnostic test) development, testing, and release, and for comparing one product (or even vaccine lot) with another. Similarly, specimen processing to obtain and analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells, although a more labour intensive process, is pivotal for the isolation and identification of light-chain and heavychain antibody sequences and the development of recombinant antibodies. Such specimens can also be used for the development of rapid diagnostic tests, vaccine design, therapeutics, and for the identification of correlates of protection, which can be useful as surrogate endpoints in vaccine trials. Validated measures of immune response are required before any regulatory authorisation for vaccine use can be granted. Such measures do not currently exist for Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, or Nipah virus, CEPI's initial priority patho gens, nor will they exist for the hypothetical Disease X. Ideally, the scientific community should agree on priorities for specimen analysis in advance of an outbreak, and the collection and distribution effort should be designed to serve the needs of vaccine, diagnostics, and therapeutics developers.

Both IIV and LAIV must be reformulated each year, and unexpectedly poor matching of vaccine with circulating strains of influenza virus can reduce efficacy to less than 50% even in those with healthy mature immune systems 136 . While LAIV is delivered intranasally and has been shown to induce a mucosal immune response more akin to natural infection, there is no demonstrated effect of LAIV on heterosubtypic immunity. Furthermore, LAIV is generally ineffective in older adults in whom preexisting immunity blocks local infection and the vaccine-induced immune response 137 . For RSV, vaccine development has been slowed by concerns about vaccine-enhanced immunopathology and inadequately defined correlates of protection, as well as the specific difficulties of inducing appropriate immune responses in infants. Candidate vaccines for other respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza virus, have been held back for both scientific reasons and economic reasons 138 . Therefore, a substantial clinical need remains for the development of vaccines, antiviral agents and immunomodulatory therapeutics based on increased understanding of immune and pathological responses of the respiratory tract.",36.64620982262228,15.166283793533415

In addition to their natural hosts, flying foxes, NiV has naturally infected pigs, horses, cats, dogs and humans; experimental infections of guinea pigs, hamsters and cats with NiV have also been demonstrated (reviewed in [78] ). In contrast, HeV appears less transmissible in nature and naturally acquired infections of only bats, horses and humans have been described, but experimentally HeV will infect guinea pigs and cats (reviewed in [78] . The use of smaller animal models to study pathogenisis and aid in the efficacy studies of vaccines and therapeutics has been problematic for both HeV and NiV. Neither virus appears capable of infecting and causing reproducible disease in mice or rabbits and infection of guinea pigs has also met with variable results, and to date, the only small animal model in use is with NiV in the golden hamster (reviewed in [79] ). Presently, among reported findings, the golden hamster and cat represent the available suitable animal models to examine the severe pathogenic processes of NiV or HeV infection and have been used in challenge experiments in the evaluation of potential antiviral therapeutics (reviewed in [79] ). A vaccination and challenge study with NiV was carried out in a hamster model using recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding full-length NiV F or G [81] . As expected, this approach did elicit neutralizing antibodies against NiV and was able to protect the animals from lethal disease. Although effective, neither of these platforms is likely to be a viable vaccine candidate for use in humans. Further, because of their BSL4 classification and highly pathogenic nature the development of live-attenuated HeV or NiV vaccines is also doubtful. However, recombinant subunit immunogens could be a viable approach for a NiV or HeV vaccine because they are extremely safe and can be administered with no risk of infection.",31.082017269782412,14.614194506871964

In the case of ABV, this seems to be a very difficult task. As described above, high anti-ABV-antibody titers are detected in clinically diseased birds, and in many cases, there seem to be a correlation between the increase of the titer and onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore it is fair to state that the antibodies that have been detected so far specifically against ABV are not protective. 87 It seems also likely that the pathogenesis of the symptoms caused by ABV are immune mediated and that ABV has developed mechanisms to escape the recognition of the immune system. 94 All these facts do not make steps toward a vaccine production very promising. To the contrary, it might even be that vaccine could in some circumstances induce the clinical disease or at least increase the severity of clinical signs. 72 However, when the pathogenesis and the details of the host immune response and the nature of different anti-ABV-specific antibodies are better understood, the window for the development of specific vaccines might open, especially based on recombinant vaccines.",23.204350511288542,14.378593411067687

However, the role of lipids in the immune response has historically been ignored or, at its best, relegated to a second level when compared to the importance given to proteins and nucleic acids. Nonetheless, advances in immunology and vaccinology are demonstrating that not only lipids are as potent as proteins and nucleic acids in mounting an immune response, but they also have the ability to modulate the response triggered by the antigen.

However, with recent developments in nanotechnology, material science and advances in immunology, subunit vaccines have gained prominence [9] . Nanoparticles (NPs) based on synthetic polymers as well as virus-like particles (VLP) offer several advantages and ways to address many of the challenges listed above. NPs provide the ability to deliver combinations of antigens in a single dose, target the vaccine formulation to specific cell types such as antigen presenting cells (APCs), allow encapsulation of either protein or DNA antigens or whole viruses, encapsulate domains that can elicit strong cross-neutralizing antibodies to protect against different strains [11] , act as adjuvants or immunomodulators, allow for sustained antigen release, enable single dose delivery to enhance patient compliance, and potentially obviate the cold chain [12] . There are several lead nanoparticle vaccine candidates that have shown great promise in mouse and other pre-clinical models, but have failed in clinical trials [13] . Therefore the selection of appropriate animal models for vaccine development is a key requirement that can aid in the translation of promising vaccine technologies to the clinic for many of these diseases [14] .

PFR-2 was tested as protein, DNA, or DNA-protein immunization, and protection levels against L. mexicana varied greatly depending on vaccine formulation, route of immunization, and sex of the animals [52] . Also, contrary to mouse studies, protein vaccination seemed more protective than DNA only vaccination. However, as in mouse studies, heterologous prime-boost vaccination with DNA and protein seemed better than DNA only [52] . Another DNA vaccine encoding PapLe22 was found to be immunogenic in hamsters and decreased parasitemia after infection with L. infantum, but further assessment of disease was not performed [54] . Immunization with KPM11 DNA induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response, but was able to protect hamsters against visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani [53] . In dogs, while several protein vaccines have been tested and a purified protein vaccine has now been licenced for veterinary use [77] , very few DNA vaccine studies have been performed. A heterologous prime-boost strategy using CPa and CPb DNA and protein was reported as immunogenic and protective [57] , but the study was of limited power given the reduced number of animals. In another study, dogs were immunized with a mixture of DNA vaccines encoding 10 different antigens previously tested in mouse models, and this immunization induced a very good immune response, with a high production of IFNγ [56] . However, evaluation of protection was limited to an acute in vitro assay [56] and further studies will be required to assess the potential of this vaccine in dogs.

Nonetheless, the relevance of such mouse models for the development of veterinary or human vaccines against these parasites has been challenged by some authors. The few DNA vaccine studies in nonmurine models of leishmaniasis suggest that some extrapolation may be feasible, but certainly not completely. Additional advanced preclinical studies of DNA vaccine candidates in nonmurine animal models such as rats, hamsters, dogs, or monkeys are thus warranted in the next few years, to further explore the immunology and efficacy of DNA vaccines against these parasites. As already observed in such studies for other pathogens, this will lead to the challenge of achieving in these species an immunogenicity of comparable level and protective efficacy as that obtained in murine models.

Similarly, information regarding packaging sequences, receptor utilization and other determinants of tissue tropism, and in vivo persistence and state of the vector genome will determine the relative usefulness of these vectors. Although preliminary studies have shown the feasibility of sequential administration of various nonhuman Ad vectors, this aspect needs to be investigated further in suitable animal models.

Given the importance of the immune response in establishing the relevance of the preclinical model, it is expected that information about the onset and duration of the antibody response be obtained. Guidelines indicate that these samples should be collected prior to exposure to the vaccine being studied, on the day of cesarian sectioning and at the end of the weaning period. While there are many ways to evaluate the immune response, antibody measurements are routinely used as a marker for vaccine-induced effects. Repeat-dose toxicity studies in non-pregnant animals may be used for this purpose unless evidence suggests that the immune response differs in pregnant animals.

The antigens may be of viral, bacterial, or parasitic origin but generally derive from those infectious agents for which no effective vaccine exists such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, dengue virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ebola virus. Because the immune response elicited by live viral III.

An initial canarypox vaccine primer is able to induce a strong cellular immunity.

Purified DNA that encodes for particular immunogenic antigens is injected in vaccine recipients. This antigen is presented to the host immune system in its native form and is processed similar to that for a natural viral infection. 316 Therapeutic immunization with a plasmid gp160 and gag þ pol DNA vaccine in HIV-positive chimpanzees have produced a significant decrease in viral load and a boost in the immune response. 317 In seronegative primates, studies show an induction of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response. However, the vaccine does not protect against HIV infection. 52 Two DNA vaccine candidates are currently in phase I trials. 52 Other potential prospects for HIV vaccine development are under investigation. In animal models, live-attenuated HIV vaccines are able to generate a broad and durable immune response. Due to potential safety concerns with live HIV virus, this vaccine has not been tested in humans. 52 Wholeinactivated vaccines have been used in chimpanzees, but inactivation of the virus often leads to a vaccine that is less potent or immunogenic without providing protection against HIV infection. 52 There is a risk that incomplete inactivation could lead to HIV infection of vaccine recipients.

Fortunately scientists almost always embark on vaccine development as soon as a pathogen is identified. The objective of those early studies of experimental vaccines is to demonstrate protection in animals. But success in animals cannot be transposed immediately to allow use in humans when an epidemic strikes.

However, a commercial safe and efficacious vaccine for HIV-1 is still not available and is unlikely in the near future, despite exhaustive efforts in HIV-1 vaccine development that began 20 years ago immediately after the initial characterization of HIV-1. 566 Several serious issues that must be resolved for future vaccine success include identification of immune correlates of protection against either lentivirus infection or virus-associated disease. The apparent difficulty of addressing this question was predictable since virus elimination has not been observed during natural infection with immunodeficiency-inducing lentiviruses, even when strong virus-specific cellular and humoral immune responses have been detected in the infected host. Vaccine-induced protection against pathogenic challenge has been difficult to achieve in both the SIV and FIV animal models, and when observed, has been inconsistent. An additional complication is presented by the specter of vaccine-induced immune responses that prove detrimental rather than protective as reported for FIV and more recently in the SIV animal model. The complication of virus strain diversity has barely been addressed by vaccine design in animal models and surely poses a major complication for HIV-1 vaccine success in the future. Successful resolution of these obstacles in vaccine development, and most particularly the lack of understanding of why some vaccines such as attenuated viruses are sometimes protective, absolutely requires continued examination of viral pathogenesis and host immune responses in animal models including both nonhuman primate and nonprimate lentivirus animal models. Elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms used by these immunodeficiencyinducing lentiviruses during the earliest stages of virus exposure and virus-host interactions will be critical for design of vaccines that will have any potential for sterilizing immunity, if such a goal is possible. Similarly, a far more precise understanding of viral mechanisms for immunodeficiency will also be necessary for design of therapies of immune reconstitution in both acutely and chronically HIV-1-infected hosts, which can only be gained through experimental animal model studies.",36.02131889932063,17.255596287403975

However, few vaccines for use in humans or specific antiviral therapeutics exist for several emerging/re-emerging viruses, including SARS, MERS-CoV, WNV, or BUNV. Thus, it is crucially important to understand the virus-host interactions that govern immunity, disease severity, and infection outcome. Recent findings have found that several viruses utilize multifaceted strategies to evade multiple arms of the innate immune response. Functionally pleiotropic suppressors such as IAV NS1 and EBOV VP35 reveal the complexity and level of sophistication by which these viral pathogens have developed as immune escape artists, but their nature as multifunctional antagonists also makes them attractive candidates in vaccines and therapeutics. For example, interventions that target IAV NS1 would suppress multiple IAV immunoevasion mechanisms, increasing the potential effectiveness of a candidate vaccine or therapy. Indeed, deletion mutants of IAV have already been tested in live attenuated vaccines in Phase I/II clinical trial, resulting in enhanced IAV-specific antibody responses [85] . With the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa, it is tempting to imagine that targeting the multifunctional EBOV VP35 may lead to the development of effective therapeutics and even a possible vaccine. Most importantly, studies aimed at expanding our understanding of viral evasion strategies undoubtedly reveal new insights into innate immune signaling and host antiviral defenses. Indeed, discovery of the RIG-I signaling pathway led to the identification of viral factors that antagonize RLR signaling. As viral pathogens continue to cause threat of global epidemics, improved understanding of host defenses will be crucial to limiting the burden of human disease.",25.067187092575193,10.43936719444192

Bactericidal activity of antibody to some of these proteins has been demonstrated, but their ability to protect against infection or enhance clearance of organisms in animal models has been variable.

In contrast, inactivated virus vaccines are safe, but unsuitable when natural infection by the pathogen itself fails to induce any long-term immunity. Recombinant subunit vaccines are considered as one of the most attractive modern vaccine types due to their high safety profiles. However, subunit vaccines are not inherently immunogenic [2, 3] . To overcome this limitation, adjuvants are incorporated in subunit vaccines to enhance immunogenicity of the vaccine antigen.

Even when the pharmaceutical industry recognizes the market potential of a vaccine against an emerging pathogen, such as HIV or hepatitis C virus, there are many difficult steps between the desire to develop the vaccine and its availability for purchase. There are more steps from the discovery of a newly EID agent to the availability of a vaccine against it than for a pathogen that has been studied for decades or more than a century. First, the pathogen must be characterized at the levels of biology, molecular composition, and its genome. Even well into the contemporary molecular, proteomic, and genomic era, knowledge of the proteome and genetic sequence provides no more complete understanding of the agent than possession of an encyclopedia, which written in a language that has been translated only partly, would impart omniscience . Second, appropriate animal models that adequately mimic the pathology of the human disease, anatomic distribution of the agent, and the human immune response to the infection must be developed. There are numerous agents that are so highly adapted to humans that no adequate animal model exists. Other models utilize animal species that do not permit effective analysis of the protective immune response owing to lack of reagents to evaluate the immune cells and proteins and absence of animals that are genetically inbred or have knockout of specific genes. Third, studies of animal models and of humans and their cells, cytokines, and antibodies are employed to elucidate the mechanisms of protective immunity. Development of a vaccine that stimulates the presence of memory cells that generate the immune components required to kill the invading pathogen rapidly requires determining which elements (e.g., antibodies, CD4, and/or CD8 T lymphocytes) are critical. Fourth, the antigens of the particular infectious agent that stimulate the protective memory immune components must be identified. For subunit vaccines, some antigens stimulate protective responses, and others suppress protective immunity. Fifth, the animal models are utilized to develop and test vaccine candidates that stimulate protective memory immune responses without harmful side effects. At the point of the primary identification of the etiology of the emerging infection, it would be unlikely that any of these five steps would have been addressed.",42.96747319886172,17.801688318909996

In the beginning, the technology of expressing antigenic determinants in plants was tapped for production of edible vaccines and local production of engineered edible plants for consumption was proposed (Artnzen, 1997; Prakash, 1996) . Later, with the technology developments, role of health care workers was discussed in order to define doses and ""Edible Vaccines"" are now more popular as ""Plant Vaccines"". Although the amount of protein required for oral delivery will vary among various antigens, oral delivery needs larger doses of the antigens in general (Rice et al., 2005; Streatfield and Howard, 2003) . For defining vaccine doses, powdered formulations can be produced from seeds or freeze-dried fruits and leaves using standard inexpensive food industry milling and processing techniques. Large scale batches of powdered plant materials can be tested to ensure consistency of vaccine dose and adequate quality control. This material may also be supplemented with mucosal adjuvant, vitamins and/or other vaccines to make it more effective. If vaccines are supplied in powdered formulations, it may also improve acceptability of vaccines in countries which are against growing genetically modified crops. The idea of plant vaccine is coming closer to reality. In recent years, a large number of antigens have been produced in plants and shown to activate the immune response against the antigen in the animal models.

Later, a SARS-CoV transgenic mouse model was developed by introducing hACE2 gene into the mouse genome. 51 The first animal model used for developing a MERS-CoV vaccine was rhesus macaques. Infected animals showed clinical symptoms such as increased body temperature, piloerection, cough, hunched posture, and reduced food intake. 52 Another frequently used animal model for MERS-CoV is the common marmoset, wherein the virus caused lethal pneumonia. 53 Humoral and cell-mediated immunity could be detected in both rhesus macaques and common marmoset following MERS-CoV immunization. 43 47 These hamsters are a potential model for studying CoV pathology and pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy.

In the humoral arm of the immune system, immune memory consists of long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells (MBCs). These high-affinity populations are generated during the initial immune response to infection and are mainly generated within the germinal center (GC), although they can also be generated in GC-independent pathways. Vaccines replicate this process without the threat replicating pathogens pose to the body. While vaccines have been the most effective intervention for many infectious diseases, there are still pathogens that have evaded successful vaccine design [7] . This can be the result of the genetic diversity of the pathogen, immune subversion and immunosuppression, and inconsistencies between local and systemic responses, for example, where a vaccine is not targeted to generating a mucosal immune response that may be critical for successful protection. In particular, persisting or recurrent pathogens such as HIV and Plasmodium are linked to an inadequate humoral response, in which the production of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies is delayed and the immune memory repertoire appears to be ineffective.",26.927549471742076,11.17581523319101

It is the administration of vaccine to produce immunity to a disease. Vaccination involves the stimulation of the immune system to prepare it for the event of an invasion from a particular pathogen for which the immune system has been primed (Arntzen 1997 ) . On recognizing the foreign substance (live/ weakened microbes, antigen or proteins) which enters the body through vaccine, the immune system activates, producing antibodies to destroy the invader. Not only this but this attack leaves behind the 'memory' T and B cells which guards body in case of any future attack by that pathogen. Some vaccines provide lifelong protection; others (such as those for cholera and tetanus) must be re-administered periodically (Langridge 2006 ) . Classically, this has been achieved by presenting the immune system with whole viruses or bacteria that have been killed or made too weak to proliferate much. However, these conventional vaccines poses threat of actually acquiring the infection from weakened or attenuated pathogenic strains. Thus newer approach uses sub unit vaccines and recombinant vaccines. These vaccines consist of specifi c macromolecules that induce a protective immune response against a pathogen rather than administering the whole pathogen in the body. A ""subunit vaccine"" refers to a pathogen-derived protein (or even just an immunogenic domain of a protein, i.e. ""an epitope"") that cannot cause disease but can elicit a protective immune response against the pathogen. Very often the subunit-vaccine candidate is a recombinant protein made in transgenic production-hosts (such as cultured yeast cells), then purifi ed, and injected as vaccines to immunize against a specifi c disease (Mor and Arntzen 2002 ) . These sub-unit vaccines increases vaccine safety by circumventing the need to use live viruses or microbes and has thus made them the preferred approach for vaccine manufacturers (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 1998 ).",32.08228528667009,13.134211671938306

Structural genomics was used in the past two decades in the rational design of important chemotherapeutics, such as HIV [43] or influenza drugs [44] , on the basis of the analysis of the complex structures from the target protein and the drug molecule. A focused structural genomics approach to determine the atomic-resolution crystal structures of virulence factors from high priority pathogens is used in the development of vaccines (structural vaccinology). Studies on the structural and antigenic characterization of the virus envelope of HIV provide some examples of the application of structural vaccinology [45] . To be effective, a vaccine must induce a strong protective immune response from B-and T-cells. Because antibodies, by specific recognition of antigen epitopes, are an effective line of defence in preventing infectious diseases, understanding the antibody/epitope interaction establishes a basis for the rational design of vaccines, leading to the development of epitope-driven vaccines, containing only selected epitopes that have been already described, for example, in the case of cancer [46] . Therefore, mapping of epitopes on the solved structure is a central point in the rational vaccine design. The atomic resolution of the epitope, however, requires a very high degree of sophistication and expertise. In silico prediction methods have the capacity to accelerate epitope discovery, and should assist in experimental design and interpretation of data. To this end, an important role is performed by immunoinformatics, which combines bioinformatics approaches with immunology (Box 3) and provides tools that are leading to a new understanding of the host immune response, with a positive impact in vaccine development [47] .",28.372584787930634,13.11178567486401

In our current study, despite a rigorous humoral immune response against NDV, these mice failed to develop a robust serum antibody response against tested NDV-expressed borrelial antigens. The fact that bacterially expressed forms of OspC and BmpA are immunogenic in C3H mice [36, 40, 42] , it raises the possibility that the near absence of a murine humoral immune response to borrelial proteins expressed by NDV vectors may be influenced by the production of glycosylated forms of these proteins by NDV. It is known that glycans can protect some viral glycopeptides from degradation in the endocytic compartments of antigen presenting cells [58] . It is also possible that glycosylated forms of borrelial proteins may mimic host sugar moieties leading to tolerance in murine immune system. Indeed, the α(2-8)N-acetyl neuraminic acid capsular structures of E. coli K1 and the type B meningococcal bacteria are poor immunogens because they are autoantigens in most mammals [59] . Other possibilities for the observed failure of antibody responses against OspC or BmpA also exist, such as the deficiency in the ability of antigen presenting cells for proper presentation of the antigens in correct forms besides the inability of T cells to respond to glycosylated forms of the proteins. Furthermore, the potential strong induction of CD8 responses could also affect the CD4-B cell help required for the development of strong humoral responses. Notably unlike NDV, VEE [25] or Vaccinia virus replicons [26] expressing another borrelial antigen (OspA) induced strong humoral immune responses in C3H mice. Thus, the lack of an antibody response in mice against the NDVexpressed borrelial antigens in the present study might be linked to an intrinsic property of the murine species, or the specific borrelial antigens, or post-translational processing, or some unknown deficiency of the NDV vector, or a combination of multiple factors. In contrast, irrespective of the cellular localization of antigens, hamsters were able to mount rapid, specific and efficient antibody responses against both borrelial antigens. The observed humoral immune response in immunized hamsters temporally coincides with the reported development of B. burgdorferi antibodies during tick-borne infection [60] . Therefore, our present study points to variations in immune response to virally produced borrelial vaccine targets in different mammals used as models of Lyme disease. Although immunization of non-human primates with NDV vectors shown to elicit protective immunity against emerging pathogens [14] , further evaluation of immune response to virally produced borrelial vaccines in primate models will reveal the suitability of NDV vectors against human Lyme disease.",27.862225587037372,12.648330266479162

In 1990, Dr. Arntzen introduced the concept of using transgenic plants to produce and deliver subunit vaccines. This idea of Arntzen proved that the edible vaccine can annihilate the restrictions in the production of traditional vaccines. In tobacco plant, (Streptococcus mutants) a surface antigen is expressed from hepatitis B by Mason et al. is the milestone in edible vaccine production. [12] In parallel to the production of edible vaccine in tobacco, they also started the production of hepatitis B and heat-labile toxin B in potato and potato plants [11] . These vaccines have an indefensible advantage of over traditional conventional vaccines. Particularly in the developing world, edible vaccine offer exciting possibilities of reducing the burden of diseases such as hepatitis b and diarrhoea where storing and administering vaccine are often major problems.

Our immune system destroys disease-causing germs that we call as pathogens and protects our body from their invasion. If our immune system is not strong enough to fight against the invading pathogens definitely we will get infectious diseases. There comes the importance of vaccination. An antigenic substance prepared from the causative agent of a disease or a synthetic substitute, used to provide immunity against one or several diseases is known as vaccines and the process of administration of vaccines is called vaccination [1] . Vaccines can be prophylactic or therapeutic depending upon the need. When the prophylactic vaccines prevent infections, therapeutic vaccines help to prevent complications of chronic infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and HPV by boosting the immune system and are still under investigation [4] . The three main vaccine production methods are the cell-based vaccines, vaccines developed by investigational manufacturing system and egg-based vaccines [5] . In common, the production of vaccines comprises of four main steps including propagation, isolation, purification, and formulation.

However, optimal antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were induced with high doses of DNA in nonhuman primates and human volunteers [2] [3] [4] .

This lower bioavailability may be due to major cellular barriers such as plasma, endo/lysosomal and nuclear membranes, nuclease degradation in vivo, and the fact that DNA has an overall net negative electrostatic charge [7, 8] . Although the use of DNA vaccines at high doses is feasible, it would impose serious limitations on the number of constructs that could be included in a vaccine. In addition, the use of very high doses of DNA is less favorable from a process economics standpoint [9] .

These approaches, which have given some encouraging results in terms of improvement of immunogenicity in animal models, are still unproven in humans.

One of its principal goals is the in silico prediction of immunogenicity at the level of epitope. The set of pathogen epitopes that interface with the host immune system is known as the 'immunome' . Recently developed in silico tools and databases can be used to identify, characterize or predict antigen epitopes recognized by T-and Blymphocytes, cells that play significant roles in infection and protective immunity. In particular, a central role is performed by Tlymphocytes, which activate B-cell growth and differentiation and are effectors of cell-mediated immunity. To carry out this role, they need to recognize peptide fragments of pathogen antigens displayed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins at the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Methods to model the MHC-peptide interface and predict immunogenic peptides sequences that account for T-cell responses, also known as T-cell epitopes, are essential in this approach to vaccine design. With the availability of entire pathogen genomes, the genome-wide application of immunogenetic approaches (immunogenomics), and immunoinformatics tools for epitope mapping, the discovery of T-cell epitopes has been accelerated, facilitating the development of vaccines [59] . Besides the cellular immune response of T-cells, the adaptive immune response is due to antibody-secreting B lymphocytes that are responsible for the humoral immune response. B-cell epitopes are defined by the discrete surface region of an antigen bound by the variable domain of an antibody.

A better understanding of the distribution of target cells and viral concentration will provide a guide for accurate and early detection of the virus. The status of the immune function should be a key parameter in gauging the treatment of SARS infection. The state of the immune system at different stages of the disease gives clues as to how immune suppressive, immune supportive and steroid therapy may best be administered in treating the disease, and may also help to determine the timing and the dosage of the treatment. Due to the lack of a good understanding of the pathogenesis and the role of immunopathology during the SARS epidemic, the administration of steroids in treating SARS was a controversial topic, and the outcome of such treatment was not uniformly beneficial. The wide spread distribution of the virus in the body and the high concentration of the virus in the blood and leukocytes imply that the virus may be transmissible through blood and body fluid. The detection of virus in the intestine, the kidney, the stool and the urine indicate that the contaminated stool and urine may also be a vehicle of viral transmission. The development of vaccine to SARS depends on the establishment of appropriate animal models. As immune dysfunction and immune pathology play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of SARS, the measurement of immune indices should be important parameters to be monitored in evaluating animal models and effectiveness of any vaccine under investigation.

This idea was quite promising in terms of providing a successful tool for mass immunization in developing countries where till now vaccination is hampered by high cost of production and delivery of vaccines. Basic concept of edible vaccines involves the production of plants containing antigens required to stimulate the immune response in human body. Thus by simply eating the plant product people will get vaccination against diseases. However the concept sounds quite simple but its development was equally complex. To produce edible vaccine, plants are engineered to contain desired gene of interest which codes for the antigen. This process is accomplished by transformation and the altered plant containing foreign gene is called transgenic plant. Thus, the process remains the same as with subunit vaccine preparation because it contains only desired antigen and not the whole pathogen. These vaccines basically work in the same way as the injected DNA vaccine, since a peptide sequence similar to an infectious part of a pathogen is synthesized, by itself, and is used to prime T and B cells in the body. The big difference in this case is that the protein sequences are encoded in a plant to form the desired protein. This protein is then ingested, as the plant or its fruit is eaten. One becomes immune against the ingested protein, as T and B cells become stimulated to proliferate and differentiate (Mor et al. 1998 ). Expression of vaccines in plant tissues eliminates the risk of contamination with animal pathogens, provides a heat-stable environment, and enables oral delivery, thus eliminating injection-related hazards (Walmsley and Arntzen 2000 ) .",26.360430408576782,10.127294168263305

The large-scale production of antigens for industrial purposes has been enabled by recombinant DNA technology. 45, 46 Some recombinant viral antigens can spontaneously assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) which are multiprotein structures without the incorporation of a viral genome. 47, 48 VLPs is a potentially safe subunit vaccine that can induce immune responses similar to those prompted by natural viral infection. 49 VLPs present repetitive high-density displays of epitopes and exhibit excellent adjuvant properties capable of inducing strong immune responses. 50 It has been found that VLPs are more stable and considerably more immunogenic than purified protein antigens. 47 Therefore, VLPs vaccines are considered as candidate alternative to whole-virus vaccines. At present, some VLPs vaccines have been licensed and commercialized. For example, 2 VLP-based vaccines produced in yeast, GlaxoSmithKline's Engerix-B® (hepatitis B virus, HBV) and Gardasil (human papillomavirus, HPV), are currently commercialized worldwide. 51, 52 A large number of VLP-based vaccine candidates are undergoing preclinical or clinical evaluations, such as influenza virus and parvovirus VLPs. 47, 53 In order to verify vaccine efficacy, various parameters have to be monitored, such as levels of antigenspecific antibodies, the immunization dose, the type of immune cells responding and adverse effects. 54 Before a new vaccine enters the market, many obstacles have to be overcome. Research and development often last for decades until a vaccine is on the market. During this time, the antigen composition of the target pathogen might be adjusted, and vaccine dosage can also be increased due to lacking the long-term immunity after immunization. 55 The antigen that can stimulate protective immune responses is usually chosen as a vaccine candidate. After researchers develop a vaccine candidate, preclinical studies with cell cultures, tissues and animals will begin. However, animal experiments are still the main focus of preclinical studies. 56 Depending on the type of vaccine and route of administration, different animal models are used, such as mice, rats, dogs and primates. 57 Pharmacological and toxicological effects of vaccine candidates should be assessed before initiation of clinical studies. Nevertheless, new vaccine candidates usually fail in the preclinical phase, since they can not guarantee safety and efficacy. The clinical evaluation involves studies of effects of vaccine candidates on healthy volunteers for immunogenicity, efficacy and safety. 58 The use of Pichia pastoris in recombinant subunit vaccine development E. coli is widely used in both commercial (for the generation of approximately 30% of biopharmaceutical products) and research laboratories (in the production of >70 % of proteins). 39, 59, 60 Although E. coli has many advantages as a production system, generating recombinant proteins in this system can often result in inclusion body formation or low yields of foreign proteins lacking post-translational modifications. 61 Therefore, this is a general decline in the use of E. coli as a host cell. Eukaryotic microbes offer many of the benefits of eukaryotic host cells, while retaining the advantages of being microbial. Among eukaryotic microbes systems, P. pastoris is a promising platform to produce various foreign proteins. P. pastoris is capable of synthesising the protein in a form that mirrored its native conformation and immunogenicity. Therefore, P. pastoris has been widely used to manufacture subunit vaccine candidates. To date, a multitude of recombinant subunit vaccine candidates have been successfully expressed in P. pastoris ( Table 1 ).

The ongoing threat to global public health and the need for novel therapeutic countermeasures have driven the development of animal models that can reproducibly replicate the pathology associated with MERS-CoV in human infections. The inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of mice, hamsters, and ferrets stymied initial attempts to generate small animal models. Identification of human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (hDPP4) as the receptor for MERS-CoV infection opened the door for genetic engineering of mice. Precise molecular engineering of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology maintained inherent expression profiles, and limited MERS-CoV susceptibility to tissues that naturally express mDPP4, notably the lower respiratory tract wherein MERS-CoV elicits severe pulmonary pathology. Here, we describe the generation of the 288-330 +/+ MERS-CoV mouse model in which mice were made susceptible to MERS-CoV by modifying two amino acids on mDPP4 (A288 and T330), and the use of adaptive evolution to generate novel MERS-CoV isolates that cause fatal respiratory disease. The 288-330 +/+ mice are currently being used to evaluate novel drug, antibody, and vaccine therapeutic countermeasures for MERS-CoV.

[62] After 572 passages, the virus lost ~15% of its genome and the ability to replicate in most mammalian cells. [63] It was used in Germany in the late 1960's to vaccinate over 100,000 individuals with very few adverse events. As smallpox did not circulate in Germany during or after this time period, there are no efficacy data on MVA. Newer versions of MVA are being produced by a number of manufacturers including: ACAM3000 by Acambis (www.clinicaltrials.gov # NCT00079820 last accessed 7/14/2009), IMVAMUNE by Bavarian Nordic [64, 65] , and TBC-MVA by Therion Biologics Corporation [66] . MVA is also a top candidate for inclusion in the US stockpile as an attenuated vaccine. NYVAC, another highly attenuated vaccine strain was derived from the parental Copenhagen vaccinia strain by deletion of 19 ORFs including the thymidine kinase, ribonucleotide reductase, complement binding, hemagglutinin and other genes. [67] While NYVAC is deemed to be a ""safer"" vaccine candidate, direct comparisons with Dryvax or Lister-based vaccines have shown that NYVAC possesses inferior immunogenicity. [18, 68, 69] From the standpoint of biodefense preparations against poxviruses, NYVAC is not an optimal vaccine candidate. On the other hand, foreign antigens can be readily incorporated in NYVAC based vectors and induce robust immunity. NYVAC is therefore a promising vehicle for the development of vaccines against other diseases. [69] [70] [71] A replication defective vaccine based on the Lister strain (dVV-L) was created through the deletion of the uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG) gene. [72] The resulting vaccine, while replication incompetent outside of certain cell lines which provide exogenous UDG is still capable of initial infection and early gene expression. Early work found that this vaccine candidate had an enhanced safety profile compared to wild-type Lister vaccine. [73] Mouse vaccination and lethal challenge studies found that dVV-L induced protective T and B cell responses against cowpox or vaccinia virus but required higher vaccine doses to prevent death in response to more virulent natural mouse pathogen, ectromelia virus. [74] The Dairen strain was used primarily in Japan during the eradication effort and more recently was used to create the attenuated Dairen-I strain. [75, 76] This strain lacks several host range and immunomodulatory genes [77] which restrict its replicative potential and may enhance its safety profile. Similar to NYVAC, Dairen-I has served as a useful vector in the development of vaccines against mycobacterium, HIV, SARS and other pathogens. [78] [79] [80] A variety of other attenuated vaccinia virus strains have been created through the selected deletion or alteration of host range genes, virulence factors and immunomodulatory genes. [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] These recombinant vaccinia strains have been shown to grow to lower titers in various organs, and/or exhibit less toxicity and morbidity in immunocompromised animal models. Other groups have used genetic engineering to incorporate growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and innate immune activators into vaccinia virus in an attempt to boost immune responses after infection. [88] Overall, attenuated vaccinia strains are far safer in animal models, especially those with defective immune responses, and in a number of cases (MVA, LC16m8) induce fewer side effects in human populations. Unfortunately a growing body of literature indicates that they are less immunogenic than their conventional vaccine counterparts, requiring high doses of antigen and/or repeat immunization to induce similar levels of antibody titers or cellular immunity.",28.232162828122235,11.399614834493526

Rhesus macaques can serve as a model for mild MERS-CoV disease, which is increasingly being reported in humans infected with MERS-CoV. 27, 28 Common marmosets are the more suitable model for severe, potentially fatal, cases of MERS-CoV disease, which are typically reported in individuals who have an underlying comorbidity or in individuals of an older age. The severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia that develops in common marmosets inoculated with MERS-CoV makes marmosets an ideal model for testing the efficacy of medical countermeasures, such as antivirals, therapeutics, and vaccines. The smaller size of common marmosets favors this model for drug studies because it significantly lowers drug quantities; however, it precludes repeated blood sampling within a short time frame, and fewer species-specific reagents are available for marmosets compared with rhesus macaques. These limitations suggest that rhesus macaques may be a more suitable model for vaccine studies if repeated analysis of immune parameters is warranted.

Vaccination should have long-term, lasting protection. Table 5 lists diseases that are preventable through available vaccines. However, there are limitations to the value of existing vaccinations. The protective effective of the vaccination may take longer than the time between exposure and onset of disease, many vaccines require multiple doses to achieve a protective immune response, not all persons mount an immune response subsequent to the vaccination, and finally, persons with impaired immunity either cannot generate an immune response to the vaccine or may experience side effects to the vaccine. Vaccines, as with any therapeutic product, may have side effects. Most side effects may be minor (injection site swelling, fever, malaise).

Based on the investigations of immune memory against SARS-CoV in follow-up studies of recovered patients (discussed above), T-cell responses can provide robust long-term memory and possess a considerable potential for cross-reactivity with heterotypic coronaviruses.

Infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response but these initial antibodies do not confer protection and can even be harmful by mediating an antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. In contrast, development of neutralising antibodies (NAs) is delayed and generation of cell-mediated immune responses, such as PRRSV-specific interferon (IFN)-c secreting cells, is initially erratic. In spite of this, induction of strong and rapid NAs and IFN-c responses seem to be required for effective vaccination. PRRSV strongly modulates the host's immune responses. The virus inhibits key cytokines, such as IFN-a, and may induce regulatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10. Development of NAs seems to be impaired by the existence of a decoy epitope close to the main neutralisation epitope in glycoprotein 5. This ability to modulate the host immune response probably varies among strains or isolates. The genetic diversity of the virus is very high and it has been shown that this diversity can have serious implications for the development of vaccines, since the immunity induced by one strain may be only partial against a different strain, even within the same genotype. With this panorama, the development of newer and universally efficacious PRRSV vaccines is challenging, but the present state of knowledge allows optimism if collaborative efforts are undertaken in the scientific community.",26.67841672581675,12.38765693792487

Although the YFV vaccine has been used in humans since 1937, little was known about how the vaccine protected from infection. With the advent of systems vaccinology, scientists were able to comprehensively examine initial molecular signatures in individuals vaccinated against YFV to not only elucidate the mechanisms behind the vaccine's efficacy, but also to establish predictive correlates for the later development of protective responses [172, 173] .

In many cases, these approaches have proven to be successful. Vaccines based on live attenuated or killed pathogens are usually very potent and can induce all aspects of immune responses. However, serious safety concerns may preclude the use of these approaches in the development of vaccines for some pathogens such as HIV (Baba et al., 1999) . New generation vaccines, such as recombinant protein-based vaccines, synthetic peptide-based vaccines, lipid-based vaccines/antigens, and vaccines based on polysaccharides, are thought to be potentially safer than traditional vaccines. Unfortunately, these new generation vaccines are often very poorly immunogenic, partially because the components having adjuvant activity were discarded in the purification or synthesis process. Some less or well defined structures of pathogens, such as bacterial cell wall components, unmethylated DNA, or double-stranded (ds) RNA, may activate the host defense system by acting as potent ""danger"" signals. Elimination of these components leads to poor immunogenicity. The reduced or lack of ability for some new generation vaccines to induce a cellmediated immune (CMI) response, especially a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response (CTL), is another limitation. For example, a recombinant protein-based vaccine elicits mainly humoral immune response (i.e., IgG and IgE production) if administered without proper adjuvants. The polysaccharide vaccine, without conjugation to an appropriate carrier protein, generates only a T cell independent (TI) response by the production of IgM (Lesinski and Westerink, 2001) . Importantly, it is currently believed that CMI, especially the CTL response, is as critical as neutralizing antibodies for the effective control of intracellular pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and malaria. In case of tumor vaccines, the ability to induce a tumor-specific CTL response is thought to be indispensable for them to be effective. Therefore, the discovery in the early 1990s that a vaccine based on plasmid DNA can induce both humoral and cellular immune responses produced great excitement in the vaccine and immunology community.",30.18526705803595,11.065184204734788

The demographic background (e.g. age for SARS) of the animal should be taken into consideration. By contrast, animal models used in vaccine/antiviral efficacy studies must demonstrate meaningful differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated control groups. Special consideration should be given to how animals from different demographic backgrounds respond to the vaccine/antiviral under investigation. To determine the correlate of protection, it is necessary to study the immune response to the vaccine as well as the response to challenge with the homologous coronavirus.

Classic viral vectors such as poxvirus, adenovirus and alphavirus vectors have been successfully used to deliver malaria antigens. Some of the vaccine candidates have demonstrated their potential in inducing malaria-specific immunity in animal models and human trials. In addition, emerging viral-vector technologies, such as measles virus (MV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and yellow fever (YF) virus, may also be useful for malaria vaccine development. Studies in animal models suggest that each viral vector is unique in its ability to induce humoral and/or cellular immune responses. Those studies have also revealed that optimization of Plasmodium genes for mammalian expression is an important aspect of vaccine design. Codon-optimization, surface-trafficking, de-glycosylation and removal of toxic domains can lead to improved immunogenicity. Understanding the vector's ability to induce an immune response and the expression of malaria antigens in mammalian cells will be critical in designing the next generation of viral-vectored malaria vaccines.

Vaccines developed by classical methods are effective for many viruses. In fact, classical vaccines played key roles on the eradication of the two important viruses, smallpox virus and RPV. However, classical vaccines still have disadvantages and thus the development of ideal vaccines using new methods is still required. Since reverse genetics of mononegaviruses has been established, the technique has been applied for the development of vaccines against many of them. In particular, reverse genetics technologies allow us to design not only improved vaccines against the mononegaviruses themselves but also multivalent vaccines inducing humoral and cellular immune response against other pathogens. Once new vaccines are developed, the efficacy and safety of the novel vaccines are first evaluated and used for the control of animal virus infectious diseases. The studies of vaccine development for animal mononegavirus diseases give us valuable knowledge, not only for applied science but also basic issues such as molecular determinants of virus virulence, and finally contribute to our health.

In the context of infectious diseases for which it is not feasible or ethical to perform clinical trials, animal studies play an additional role. Under the FDA's Animal Efficacy Rule (""Animal Rule"") therapeutics against rare, emerging, or virulent agents can achieve regulatory approval provided efficacy is demonstrated in two animal models (one of which must be a non-rodent species) that display clinical illness representative of human disease (FDA, 2014) . The ideal animal model is permissive to infection and reproduces the clinical course and pathology observed in humans. An algorithm for the development of animal models is presented in Fig. 1 . Small animal models offer several advantages over NHPs including availability of animals and species specific reagents, ease of handling, reduced cost, and the ability to use sufficient numbers for statistical analysis. Especially with coronaviruses, rodents vary in susceptibility and may be semi-permissive to infection and refractory to clinical disease , even so, they can be used to screen countermeasures Bisht et al., 2004; Buchholz et al., 2004; . Thus, to generate a rodent model that displays clinical disease it may be necessary to adapt the virus to enhance virulence for the rodent host or generate transgenic animals.

However, one of the main challenges for a recombinant protein-based vaccine is that the protein itself is poorly immunogenic. As such, many recombinant protein-based vaccines require the addition of an adjuvant to boost immune responses, especially when a Th1-biased immune response is desired. Most of the experimental malaria vaccines are currently using adjuvants that have yet to be used in licensed vaccines. In addition, many antigenic targets are highly structured and proper conformation seems to be required to generate a functional immune response. This leads to challenges in developing the purification process where refolding and isolation of proper conformers often results in complex manufacturing processes and low yields. Another challenge is the long-term stability of recombinant proteins when they are formulated in adjuvants at ambient temperatures. Viral vectors, on the other hand, appear to be capable of inducing both antibody and T-cell-mediated immunity in the absence of an adjuvant. Furthermore, complex process development may not be required for viral-vectored vaccines, which usually have a consistent purification process, irrespective of the transgene they express. As these vaccines use the eukaryotic cellular machinery to generate the antigenic targets, it may be possible to generate antigens with native conformation. Finally, some of the viral vectors have the capacity to deliver more than one gene. Thus, a single viral vectored construct may contain multiple antigens from the different parasite life stages and would have the potential to induce a broad protective immunity. Significant manufacturing cost savings could also be realized.",27.544206064421097,10.692309292671437

However, reports of immunopathologic reactions in older mice and in non-human primates vaccinated with SARS-CoV vaccines that were subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [57, 59, 62, 64] have revealed two concerns about proceeding to clinical trials with SARS-CoV vaccines. First, there is a precedent for coronavirus-vaccine associated disease enhancement; kittens immunized with a vaccinia virus vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus vaccines developed severe disease when they were subsequently infected with FIPV [65] . In these kittens, non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies facilitated viral entry into macrophages. The concern that is extrapolated from the FIPV vaccine experience to human SARS-CoV vaccines is whether vaccine recipients will develop more severe disease if they are exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV after neutralizing antibody titers decline. The second concern is whether recipients of a SARSCoV vaccine would be at risk of developing pulmonary immunopathology following infection with an unrelated human coronavirus e.g. 229E, OC43, HKU1 or NL63 that usually causes mild, self limited disease.

These infections often serve as highly useful models of disease. For instance, MHV-1 causes severe respiratory disease in susceptible A/J and C3H/HeJ mice, A59 and MHV-3 induce severe hepatitis, while JHMV causes severe encephalitis. Interestingly, MHV-3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade [68] . Most notably, A59 and attenuated versions of JHMV cause a chronic demyelinating disease that bears similarities to multiple sclerosis (MS), making MHV infection one of the best models for this debilitating human disease. Early studies suggested that demyelination was dependent on viral replication in oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord [69, 70] ; however, more recent reports clearly demonstrate that the disease is immune-mediated. Irradiated mice or immunodeficient (lacking T and B cells) mice do not develop demyelination, but addition of virus-specific T cells restores the development of demyelination [71, 72] . Additionally, demyelination is accompanied by a large influx of macrophages and microglia that can phagocytose infected myelin [73] , although it is unknown what the signals are that direct immune cells to destroy myelin.

In the past, many investigations relied on the similarities in the phenotypic presentation of disease in animals compared to humans, rather than similarities in the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. By relying on phenotypic similarities and assumed absolute conservation of molecular processes in closely related animals of different species, investigators have raised doubts about the ability of existing animal models to accurately recapitulate human disease or predict efficacy of candidate therapeutics in humans (Seok et al., 2013) . In addition, the scientific, funding, and regulatory communities realize that one animal model may not recapitulate all aspects of disease. Expectation of uniform or near uniform lethality from pathogen challenge is neither reasonable or in all cases appropriate. As a result, with the use of alternative endpoints besides lethality, investigators can evaluate MCM in nonlethal models rather than forcing a disease course more severe than the human condition.",31.342941673080038,11.223898080505895

The highest rate of RSV hospitalization is among infants less than 3 months of age 45 , which is when the ability to elicit a strong anti-body response to vaccine may be compromised by the presence of maternal antibodies and the immaturity of the infant immune system. In addition, vaccine formats that might be capable of eliciting strong RSV-neutralizing serum antibody responses in children, comparable to those achieved with antibody immunoprophylaxis (such as parenteral administration of properly folded viral protein subunits formulated with adjuvant), would be difficult to clinically develop, at least in part, because of concerns that these vaccines may potentiate RSV disease. In the 1960s, a formalin-inactivated, alum-adjuvanted whole-virus vaccine was tested in infants and children; however, it not only failed to protect against RSV disease but also resulted in immune-mediated disease enhancement 46 . The subsequent development of animal models of RSV vaccine disease enhancement suggested that parenteral vaccination of RSV-naïve animals with subunit vaccines could result in enhanced pulmonary pathology after RSV challenge 47 .

However, the development of a vaccine against AIDS represents a substantial scientific challenge related to HIV antigenic variability, the lacking understanding of immune correlates for protection, limitations of available animal models, and the enormous constraints associated with the probable need for multiple large-scale clinical trials in different parts of the world (for review, see Excler et al., 2014) . Moreover, the fragile immune system of HIV-infected individuals sets high standards to candidate vaccine safety. In the recent past, highly attenuated poxviruses continued to play a major role in the international search for an AIDS vaccine also taking advantage of established technologies for vector vaccine production at industrial scale. Different recombinant MVAexpressing HIV proteins have undergone preclinical and clinical testing for the activation of protective immune responses against AIDS often in combination with DNA-based and/or adenoviral vector vaccines (for review, see Iyer and Amara, 2014; Ondondo, 2014) . Recombinant MVA vaccines targeting different HIV-1 subtypes continued to prove safe and immunogenic in additional clinical studies (Goepfert et al., 2014; Joachim et al., 2015; Munseri et al., 2015; Nilsson et al., 2015) . Important new findings included data for the induction of high levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies and months durability of the vaccine-induced HIV Env-specific antibody responses. In this context, a necessary target antigen comprises the immunodeficiency virus envelope (Env) protein, as it could be shown to elicit antibody responses with enhanced protective capacity in nonhuman primate chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) or SIV challenge infection models (Barouch and Michael, 2014; Barouch and Picker, 2014; Roederer et al., 2014) . Recent approaches are working on the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies at the mucosal site of viral entry based on Env-specific vaccines. Other important HIV immunogens delivered by MVA candidate vaccines include Gag, Pol, and Nef proteins targeting the induction of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells . In addition, new synthetic HIV-specific ""mosaic"" immunogens are under evaluation as improved antigens for induction of CD8 + T cells (Ondondo et al., 2016) . The large number of different HIV candidate vaccine necessitates the development of preclinical model systems to evaluate and select the most promising vaccine candidates. In many preclinical experiments, varying degree of protection against homologous immunodeficiency virus infection has been found, predominantly depending on the challenge virus and/or the animal model used for evaluation. However, HIV has an extraordinary genetic diversity and the ""Holy Grail"" AIDS vaccine would have to cross-protect against different HIV clades. A major scientific challenge is now to find appropriate antigens or epitopes that elicit a cross-protective immune response. For sometime, induction of cellular immunity was the primary focus of HIV vaccine development but the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies is also believed to be indispensable (Douek et al., 2006) . Previous data from two studies in the macaque model showed that booster vaccinations with oligomeric or native Env proteins enhance Env-binding and virus-neutralizing antibody responses primed by recombinant MVA vaccines, and suggest that such antibodies are indeed likely to play a role in vaccine-induced protection (Earl et al., 2002) . Currently, SIV or SHIV challenge infections in different nonhuman primates are considered to be the most appropriate animal models to test for immunogenicity and efficacy. These models very closely mimic the pathogenesis of HIV infections in humans concerning viremia, progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells, and the clinical manifestation of AIDS (Van Rompay, 2012). The thorough characterization of recombinant MVA candidate vaccines in the SIV model continues to further elucidate on the protective capacity of SIV antigenspecific immune responses (Chamcha et al., 2016; Iyer et al., 2015; Kwa et al., 2015; Valentin et al., 2014) . Thus, these nonhuman primate models might allow for the generation of proof-of-concept data on antiviral immunity that effectively inhibits immunodeficiency virus replication and disease development.",26.98654281867346,12.589297454759283

The adoption of upto-date methodology for convenient vector generation, vector quality control, and vector vaccine immune monitoring has increased the pace of development, bringing recombinant MVA vaccines into clinical trials. Initial studies testing MVA vaccines for prophylaxis or immunotherapy of AIDS, malaria, human papilloma virus-associated cancer or melanoma have already been completed (Table 1) . First results are, overall, very encouraging and confirm clinical safety. Importantly, however, they also demonstrate clinical efficacy, despite the intrinsic difficulties associated with these target diseases. Renewed interest in the development of MVA as candidate vaccine against an orthopoxvirus-related biothreat is likely to provide the basis for feasible large-scale manufacturing of MVA vaccines. Indeed, first studies suggest that MVA would provide a suitable orthopox vaccine, if necessary. The use of recombinant MVA to simultaneously provide immunity against smallpox has been proposed.

This is of particular importance with coronaviruses, as some coronavirus vaccines showed immune-mediated enhancement of disease, or so-called ''vaccine-induced immunopotentiation.'' For these vaccines, vaccine-induced immunity in animals is atypical and wanes quickly. Subsequent infection with the agent of interest then results in increased pathology compared to unvaccinated animals (Deming et al., 2006; Vennema et al., 1990) . For SARS-CoV, this effect is thought to be caused by incorporation of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, resulting in induction of an atypical Th2 adaptive immune response and consequently eosinophilic immunopathology rather than the Th1 immune response associated with natural SARS-CoV infection (Bolles et al., 2011a; Tseng et al., 2012; Tsunetsugu-Yokota et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2004; Yasui et al., 2008) .",40.72182133097532,17.12197924459655

One issue is that some of the phenotypic markers used to discriminate immune cell populations in mice are absent in humans, and some subpopulations of immune cells differ between humans and mice (reviewed in REF. 18 ). In addition, mouse and nonhuman primate models often incompletely reproduce human disease phenotypes, and these species are often resistant to infection with human-specific pathogens 18 .

Production in transgenic plants is scalable and relatively inexpensive. Veterinary vaccines will ideally be stable and not require cold chain storage and transport; expression of vaccine antigens in plant storage organs such as seeds and tubers provides a protective storage vehicle. An easy route of administration will allow the vaccine to be used more broadly in settings where trained veterinary professionals are not at hand and for administration to large populations: Production of an edible vaccine in a fodder crop or reconstituted in feed pellets allows for easy administration by feeding. Most importantly, any vaccine must be safe and effective at protecting the immunized animal from the target disease: Plant-production systems have been used to express protective vaccine candidates, without the risk of contamination with animal pathogens.

However, several major issues discourage Prophylactic vaccines are given to healthy people of all ages to prevent disease. The safety of the product is thus paramount, but the risk of adverse events in all people given any pharmaceutical product will never be zero. In recognition of this problem, the US National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-660) established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which became operational in 1988. The VICP acts as an efficient alternative to the judicial system for those seeking recourse, who allegedly were injured by a select group of vaccine products, including childhood hepatitis A and trivalent influenza vaccines. Innovative vaccines are currently excluded from coverage under VICP. Low return on investment also adversely affects innovative vaccine development. Vaccine research, development and manufacturing requirements are similar to those of therapeutics, but vaccines generally are cheaper and are administered in smaller and fewer doses compared with most therapeutics, particularly those for chronic conditions. Therefore, investment in vaccine product development is less attractive than that for therapeutics. Within the vaccine category, more risk is associated with the development of innovative vaccines compared with incremental improvements made to previously approved products. The emphasis on childhood vaccines during the past decade has occurred, in part, because the market for childhood vaccines, most of which are government-recommended and required for entry into schools, is well established and understood.

Animal models are poorly predictive, and even immunological parameters in humans, like the induction of pathogen-neutralizing antibody responses, are not fully predictive. As a result, vaccine effi cacy has to be measured in terms of reduction of disease. This is sometimes very diffi cult because symptoms of a disease can be caused by more than one pathogen (e.g., infl uenzalike illness). To measure protection, one has to detect the infl uenza virus in the group with infl uenza-like illness. In addition, to measure reduction of disease, the groups in the trial need to be very large because it is unknown who will get the disease. Sometimes tens of thousands of people are included in phase 3 trials. Systems biology approaches that may limit these problems in the future are under development. The idea is to identify gene signatures that correlate with a protective immune response. This is done by a combination of gene expression analysis for, e.g., lymphocytes in the blood and functional assays like measurement of antibodies, cytokines, and cellular responses. Bioinformaticians try to unravel pathways and networks of genes involved in immune responses. Eventually, it may be possible to assign the activity of a limited number of genes to protective immune responses (Nakaya et al. 2011 ) . Perhaps that such gene signatures can be used in future clinical trials (Pulendran et al. 2010 ). This approach would allow for reduction of the size of clinical studies, reduce the risk of late stage failure, and assess the signifi cance of animal models in the preclinical phase of vaccine development.",34.90435954296729,15.313679050678505

It is noteworthy that although the major clinical manifestations of the disease involve the respiratory system, the key component of the pathogenesis seems to be related to the immune system. Hyperinduction of chemokines and cytokines, insufficient interferon reaction, and a compromised cellular immune response caused by direct infection or indirect injury of immune cells may all contribute to SARS-related pathological changes. 94 A compromised immune response may lead to aggravation of SARS-CoV-induced lung injury, which otherwise might not have been so widespread and devastating. A more comprehensive understanding of the key features of the pathogenesis is crucial to establish appropriate animal models, which are essential for the production of vaccines.

Finding any experimental studies that support this frequency is difficult. From other immune systems, it is clear that too frequent vaccination in young animals can lead to antigen-specific tolerance (ie, the lack of any immune response to the antigen) [53] , which is the result of suppressive T cells and the deletion of T and B clones specific for those antigens. Another possible adverse outcome of overvaccination is autoimmunity, whose development is based on priming against the animal's own antigens (self) or closely mimicking vaccine antigens to the animal's own antigens. An example of this mimicry is antibodies against one of the surface proteins of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) cross-reacting with a surface protein of the immune cells [54] . Stimulation of inflammatory mechanisms associated with vaccination (eg, adjuvants such as alum or microbial ligands) or repeated re-exposure to vaccine components that drive expansion of autoimmune B-and T-cell clones may occur with frequently repeated vaccine stimulation [55, 56] . In all animals after vaccination there is expansion in the populations of responding T-and B-cell clones (Fig. 3) . Requirements for good immune response are that this clonal expansion stops and that an active process of cell death (apoptosis) occurs (see Fig. 3 ). This ''waning process'' allows ''culling'' of T or B cells that may be poor responders or even cause autoimmunity to be removed by apoptosis [57] .

This problem has been demonstrated with several pathogens, including rotavirus [31] , BVDV [32] , bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) [33, 34] , bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) [35] , and Mannheimia (Pasturella) haemolytica [36] . The timing of many vaccines administrated by the parenteral route involves estimating when the level of maternal antibody is low enough for an active immune response to progress sufficiently to provide vaccine immunity (see Fig. 1 ). Most maternal antibody has a decay half-life of 16 to 28 days [37] . The prime window for vaccination can be anywhere from a few weeks to 8 months. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , this period can vary by animal and depends on the level of maternal antibody and the vaccine antigen, which presents a major challenge for vaccine development.

Vaccination of animal models with heat inactivated HMPV has also been shown to be unsafe with enhanced level of Th2 cytokines and eosinophil infiltration in lungs of vaccinated animals [40] . The outcome of vaccination with abovementioned inactivated virus suggest for the development of better strategies to generate HMPV specific vaccines. In past few years, nanoemulsion based inactivation of virus like RSV was demonstrated to yield safe vaccines which could induce effective humoral immune response and enhanced viral clearance from the host body [59] .

However, evidence for cross reactive immune responses against different CoVs is limited to a few studies. Convalescent SARS-CoV patient sera weakly neutralized MERS-CoV [75] and SARS-S reactive antisera showed low level neutralization of MERS-CoV [61] . Extra-RBD S1 or S2 epitopes could be responsible for this effect, as some neutralizing epitopes have been identified in these regions of the S protein [58, 62] . These may not be as immunodominant as the RBD epitopes but could provide a rationale for the development of a cross protective CoV epitope-focused vaccine. A recent study also demonstrated the potential role of adaptive response against N protein in protection against MERS-CoV infection as this vaccine candidate produced a protective T-cell response against MERS-CoV challenge which was also partially protective against SARS-CoV [27 ] . Moreover, infection of mice with SARS-CoV reduced MERS-CoV titers 5 days p.i. upon challenge suggesting the development of a cross reactive T-cell response [26] . Thus, mapping and focusing the immune response towards these critical neutralizing and T-cell epitopes, which could be subdominant, may provide a way to induce immune responses with a broader activity against different CoVs. Immune focusing may also be beneficial for the generation of a robust virus-specific immune response. As during vaccine preparation, some epitopes which are normally hidden in the full length protein structure get exposed. Some epitopes could be immunodominant and have a negative contribution on the overall neutralization capacity produced by the vaccine [76 ] . This also holds true for some non-neutralizing immunodominant epitopes, as S1-based vaccines induced slightly higher neutralization than whole S ectodomain-based ones [58, 53] . Additionally, the RBD induced higher neutralizing antibodies compared to an S1 subunit vaccine [48] , and shorter regions of RBD induced even higher neutralization responses [66] , indicating that additional regions inducing non-neutralizing antibodies may contribute negatively to the overall neutralization response produced. Additionally, antibody-dependent enhancement of the viral infection by non-neutralizing antibodies [77] [78] [79] , despite not being reported so far for MERS-CoV, needs also to be taken into consideration when developing a coronavirus vaccine. One approach to enhance the efficacy of subunit vaccines is to mask those negativelycontributing epitopes through glycosylation [76 ] . Other approaches are immunefocusing and epitope-based vaccines, all aiming at narrowing the immune response to target only critical or beneficial epitopes to produce a stronger protective response. A prerequisite to reach that goal is to map epitopes targeted by the immune system and identify their biological role as being neutralizing, non-neutralizing, infection enhancing, containing a Tcell epitope, and so on. This can be achieved by analyzing the activity and fine specificity of convalescent patient sera, infected animal polyclonal sera, monoclonal antibodies, animal and human PBMCs. Subsequently the predicted epitopes can also provide a basis for potential vaccine candidates when produced as nanoparticles or VLPs. Further characterization of the immune responses induced by these vaccine candidates when evaluated in an animal model may be utilized to optimize the vaccines for efficacy (Figure 1 ). This epitope-focused vaccine approach may allow for targeting less immunodominant B-and T-cell epitopes having broader protection, avoid eliciting immune responses against epitopes playing no role in protection or having a negative or harmful role. In addition to better targeting of protective immunodominant epitopes, a combination of those epitopes, B-and Tcell epitopes targeting different viral proteins, could be used to produce a broader and stronger protective immune response for both strain-specific and universal CoV vaccines.",28.681583039814495,12.875637707609922

Like any other virus, both innate and adaptive immune components are essential to clear the HMPV infection but it induces a weak memory response in the host [31, 38] . Innate immune responses are the first line of defence against the viral infection and act by recognizing the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) on the viral particles through the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present on the immune cells in the respiratory tracts. The common PRRs like membrane bound Toll-likereceptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), cytoplasmic RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptors (NLRs) recognize the viral PAMPs and initiate the inflammatory and immune response via the cytokines produced by the cells in respiratory tract [19] . MyD88 (common adaptor of TLRs) mediated pathways has been shown to be essential for pulmonary immune response to HMPV infection by recruitment of immune cells to lungs [83] . However, HMPV G protein has an important role in inhibiting the innate immune responses by targeting RIG-I in host cell cytoplasm [4, 55] . On the other hand, adaptive immunity is highly virus specific. During HMPV infection, the protective humoral immunity is mostly directed towards the F protein of the virus rather than G and SH proteins [35] . The cell mediated immune response is majorly responsible for immune surveillance in the infected host and clears the virus infection by activation of virus specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) which induces the apoptosis of infected cells or by activating the Th cells to further activate B cells and other immune cells like DCs and macrophages [19] . Studies done on mice models indicate that during HMPV primary infection, CD4 ? as well as CD8 ? T cells are responsible for inflammation and body weight loss leading to severe lung disease but they also have a protective role of clearing the virus infection from the host's body which is evident by accumulation of HMPV specific CTLs in the lungs of infected host at approximately 7 days post infection [2, 43, 54] . In the HMPV infected elderly hosts, Th2 skewing response seems to be the cause of aggravated lung diseases [25] . However, if CD4 ? T cells are depleted, the infection is less severe and CD8 ? T cells alone can effectively clear the virus infection [54] . Interestingly, it was also demonstrated in one of the recent study that the expression patterns of inhibitor receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) during HMPV infection leads to impairment of CD8 ? T cell response which further contributes to HMPV re-infection [33, 34, 104 ].",23.282900945292848,12.662697624744403

Additionally, protein-based vaccines were developed in various platforms as virus-like particles (VLPs) [60] , nanoparticles [61] , peptide-based [62] , and subunit vaccines directed against various regions of the spike protein S1 [58] , the N-terminal domain [63] , and the RBD [48, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . Those vaccines have the highest safety profile among vaccine platforms but confer variable degrees of immunogenicity which need adjustment for the dose, adjuvants, and site of administration to get optimal protective responses. Adjuvants influence the type and magnitude of immune response produced by vaccines, and thus the doses used [61, 65, 68] . Additionally, the route of administration is a determining factor for the type of vaccine-induced immune response produced in the host. While intranasal (i.n.) vaccination with SARS-N produced a protective airway T-cell response against SARS-CoV in mice, subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination, inducing systemic T-cell responses, did not [27 ] . Likewise, i.n. vaccination with MERS-RBD induced a significantly higher neutralizing and IgA antibody responses in the mice airways compared to s.c. vaccination [70] . This is important because mucosal immunity and airway memory T-cell responses are crucial players in protection against respiratory viruses, since these areas are the first to encounter the virus. Therefore, along with selecting antigens for a vaccine, the route of vaccination and adjuvants are key players that cannot be neglected in vaccine design.",24.388857697007918,11.60767665812895

Some TLR combinations can produce a stronger and selective immune response, and others can down-regulate cytokine expression (Gupta et al., 2014) . Cytokines are components of a fine-balanced network of immune responses with multiple feedback loops (Schat, 2015) ; thus, it is possible that inserting cytokine genes or using TLR ligands may deregulate the fine-tuning that exists in the naturally perfectly-timed system that leads to an enhanced immune response (Cardenas Garcia et al., 2016) . In addition, the immunomodulatory effect of cytokines and TLR ligands may depend on various factors, such as the type of the pathogen, the amount and type of the co-delivered antigen, the relative time of administration, and the amount of delivered cytokine/ligand.

HMPV, being a RNA virus, is highly prone to mutation and development of an effective vaccine candidate is a challenge, yet research on the development of a universal vaccine candidate is underway. Inactivated vaccine candidates against HMPV have not yet been successfully tested in animal models with most of them leading to enhanced disease severity upon subsequent natural infection. On the other hand, vaccination with subunit vaccine composed either of purified HMPV fusion protein or the fusion protein expressed via different viral or bacterial vectors viz. retroviral vector, alphavirus vector, rBCG etc. could induce protective immunity against both homologous as well as heterologous strains of the virus, though for a short duration. Fusion protein based VLPs in combination with certain adjuvants like TiterMax Gold are also highly immunogenic and protective against the virus. Though the inactivated or subunit vaccines are safe but the requirement of booster doses and lack of strong cellular immune response poses a limitation on its use. The live attenuated viruses overcome this limitation. Recombinant approach to develop live attenuated viral vaccine candidate through reverse genetics technique can be considered as one of the best approach, provided a good level of attenuation is attained and immunogenicity is maintained. Attempts to generate live attenuated HMPV vaccine candidates have been successful with good protective efficacy in rodents and non-human primates but none of them have yet entered the clinical trials. However, it can be said that though HMPV was discovered late, significant advances have been made to intervene the viral infection.",24.620636462337952,10.830298089691514

Further development of MERS-CoV and other CoV vaccines thus needs proactive collaborative efforts from researchers filling knowledge gaps, and market stakeholders providing funding for this costly process. The latter can be insufficient and/or unsustainable, therefore hindering development of even some promising candidates. In an initiative aiming at accelerating vaccine R&D process by providing sustained funding to be prepared for future epidemics, the World Economic Forum launched the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) [80] . CEPI is an international non-profit association aiming at removing barriers facing vaccine development for epidemic infections and getting ready for future epidemics, including MERS-CoV. However, we still face a number of challenges despite the fact that various promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidates are currently available. There is a lack of animal models mimicking the disease in humans in which vaccine platforms can be tested prior to human use. We need to take into account the populations to target with vaccination, with camels and camel handlers being the most relevant ones. The lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis and immune responses to the virus in humans and camels, which is crucial for vaccine development, also needs further investments. In addition, the longevity of immune responses post-vaccination has not been evaluated for vaccine candidates, which is important for the vaccination scheme development and for the choice of the best candidates for further development. Lastly, most of the vaccine candidates are developed against the highly variable spike protein and thus may not be able to provide protection against CoV strains evolving in the future. A more targeted vaccination approach aiming at conserved epitopes should be considered for the development of a more broadly-acting CoV vaccine. Given the propensity of CoVs to jump the species barrier, current efforts to develop a MERS-CoV vaccine may also be of benefit to prepare for potential novel CoVs that may emerge in the future.",27.35231194884601,10.363587464857675

The geometric mean anti-gp70 and anti-FOCMA values were considerably greater following SC vaccination than after IM vaccination. Only 2 SC doses were needed to produce strong gp70 and FOCMA antibody values equal to those observed following the 3-dose IM regimen. Thus, the SC route elicited an antibody response that was both stronger and more rapid than the IM response. It appears that route of administration, indeed, affects the immune response to antigens and that a 2-dose regimen may be sufficient for efficacy, although the manufacturers still suggest 3 doses for maximal effect.

This knowledge is being applied to the recent emergence of MERS-CoV in the human population. With its strikingly high morbidity and mortality rates in hospitalized individuals, it is clear that MERS-CoV has the potential have a profound impact on the human population. However, its low penetrance thus far suggests that the virus might ultimately fail to develop a niche in humans or it might still be adapting to human hosts and that the worst of its effects are yet to come. Studies with SARS-CoV suggest that MERS-CoV research should focus on establishing animal models that recapitulate replication, pathogenesis and transmission in humans. A priority is to develop treatments to prevent viral-induced immune pathology, particularly in the elderly. Furthermore, vaccines that target conserved alleles and provide broad protection against strains that are both closely and distantly related to the vaccine strain should be developed. One particular concern is the possibility that MERS-CoV vaccines can elicit T H 2 cell immune pathology, as seen with inactivated, vectored and DNA SARS-CoV vaccines. Live-attenuated vaccines and vaccine combinations (for example, inactivated virus combined with DNA vaccines) do not seem to induce this immune phenomenon; thus, these approaches might hold more promise for the development of successful vaccination strategies, particularly in older populations. Adjuvants that promote more robust T H 1 cell responses should also be evaluated in more rigorous models. A second concern is that for SARS-CoV escape from neutralization is driven by spike protein variability; thus, spike-dependent vaccine strategies might require multivalent approaches 124 . For MERS-CoV, the natural variation in the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein is mostly unknown; thus, it is essential that more natural isolates are recovered and sequenced from humans and reservoir species. Focusing on these priorities will not only help to combat the emergence of MERS-CoV but will also increase our preparedness for any future coronavirus emergence events that originate from the vast, mutable zoonotic reservoir. As such, heterologous SARS-CoV-and MERS-CoV-related isolates that encode even minute variations in the spike protein will be important reagents for evaluating vaccine efficacy against future emerging strains.",26.356476977488754,13.28562780246881

First, because of the possibility of delivering divalent or even perhaps multivalent vaccines, using a single type of vector can result in a single manufacturing process rather than several and possibly even a single vaccination rather than several. Therefore, vectored vaccines have the potential to be less expensive to the manufacturer and the end user. Because the foreign gene is being expressed in the cells of its natural host, it is expected that any post-translational modifications required will be correct and produce an authentic antigen, as opposed to Escherichia coli or baculovirus systems (among others) that do not always produce authentic foreign proteins. Depending on the vector selected it may be possible to deliver the vectored vaccine more conveniently to the mammal or bird by spray or water or some other means rather than by needle injection. Such a mass administration approach may be particularly relevant to the poultry industry. The vector could also be constructed to deliver simultaneously an immunomodulator (e.g., gamma interferon), which could modify the type or magnitude of the immune response to allow the vaccine to be successful or more successful than it would be otherwise. The vector only expresses the antigens from the pathogen that are required to elicit a protective immune response and therefore reduces or eliminates the chance of disease by being exposed to the whole pathogen as with a killed or modified live vaccine. Finally, the appropriate viral vectors will induce both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses and in some cases are particularly suitable for inducing a local immune response in the mucosal surfaces.",31.532513795927372,12.582450690390987

Although these tests have become substantially easier to implement, their performance is still dependent on specimen quality and technician training, because environmental contamination can easily confound accurate interpretation of results. Serologic assays-such as those based on immunofluorescence, immunochromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbence and live-virus or pseudovirus neutralization-vary in their performance characteristics, but provide benefits over NAATs in the form of easier implementation and more functionally relevant readouts 8 . The performance of any assay, particularly with respect to MERS-CoV, depends on when it is administered during the natural history of disease. A more detailed understanding of the key features of the clinical course of MERS-CoV infection is, therefore, needed to inform the optimization of existing assays and the development of next-generation diagnostics. It was generally agreed that, even in the absence of these data, there is an urgent need 18 . One of the lessons learned from the Hendra experience is that preclinical development and animal-model testing in relevant smaller animal models should be extensive before efficacy trials are commenced in larger-animal target populations, such as horses, or in the case of MERS-CoV, dromedary camels. Downselection of vaccine candidates in smaller animals increases the likelihood of success in large animals, which is crucial because the costs are much higher and logistical challenges much greater in the latter models. An additional lesson to take from previous experiences with animal vaccines for human health is to engage affected populations and educate them on the potential benefits and risks of a vaccine for their animals (i.e., camels) and communities. One of the difficulties facing the development of effective vaccines for MERS-CoV is the absence of an animal model that recapitulates the pathogenesis and natural history of severe human disease. Two presentations and pipelines and stressed that most vaccines fail to advance beyond phase 1 testing because of a lack of interest from funders and limited industrial support.

Also the only antigens that can be delivered are those that are encoded by nucleic acid. Thus such things as lipopolysaccharides are not deliverable. With any vector, regardless of type, only a limited amount of foreign genetic material can be inserted into the vector's genome stably and expressed appropriately. One must always be wary of altered tissue tropisms due to the expression of the foreign gene(s). Of course the effectiveness of a viral vector is limited by preexisting immune response in the animal from prior exposure to the virus used to construct the vector.

Consequently, vaccine efficacy in the elderly is a key property of efficacious SARS-CoV vaccines. Immunosenescence is common in animal models and in clinical studies that occur during aging, and vaccine efficacy is often attenuated in the elderly (Frasca et al., 2005; Song et al., 1997; Zheng et al., 1997) . Immune complications include a generalized decrease in the function of B and T cell and innate immune function, diminished macrophage and granulocyte function, diminished cellular traffic, cell growth and differentiation and decreased natural killer cell numbers and activity. New and different vaccine regimens should be developed and tested with the ultimate goal of eliciting complete protection against antigenically heterologous forms of SARS-CoV, especially in the most vulnerable elderly populations, and that there is a need for further testing developing vaccines that induce an anti-N response in more animal models, similarly to what has been described in other viral systems (Frech et al., 2005; McElhaney, 2005) .",29.802495233773943,11.039968839681064

The strict scientific position defends that there are no consistent data on the efficacy of current vaccine prototypes to carry out phase III clinical trials. Consequently, such investment should be concentrated in basic research in order to get a better understanding on the mechanisms of protective immune responses and to develop new relevant animal models. Faced with this stance, a more humanist position bases the start of phase III trials on the catastrophic situation in developing countries and on the counterargument that, if there are no adequate animal models, it will be anyway necessary to carry out all the phases of the studies, including phase III, in humans to obtain a definitive response. Despite the reticence and pessimism of a large part of the scientific community, the general impression is that phase III trials will be carried out. It is important to remember the cost and effort involved in these trials, which require the follow-up of 10,000 patients for at least five years to obtain conclusive results. Therefore, with regard to aids vaccines, we are living in difficult times in which a huge economic investment will be necessary so that the scientific community can generate, develop and evaluate all the vaccine prototypes imaginable in animal models in order to find the Holy Grail of vaccines. As a reference, in case the European Union decided to start a program of phase I and II clinical trials with a reduced number of vaccine prototypes already generated in European laboratories an investment of 1.2 billions euros in the following 10 years should be required. With this objective in mind, the development of vaccine research centers has been proposed 68 . These centers would combine: (i) a critical mass of investigators, (ii) their sole dedication to the development of prototype HIV vaccines, (iii) a long-term commitment by academic, governmental and private institutions, (iv) sufficient resources and (v) continuous exchange of information and collaboration with the private sector. As a consequence of this policy the main leader organizations (NIH, IAVI, ANRS, EU, Gates Foundation...) should finance vaccine development centers and would coordinate their work. The prototypes considered interesting would be prepared under the conditions of Good Manufacturing Practice for use in humans and would enter a previously defined process of pre-clinical studies and phase I, II and III clinical trials. All the prototypes would meet the minimum requirements for clinical application, which would mean not only defining these criteria but also involving the regulatory authorities (FDA, EMEA) in their development. The evaluation of prototypes also requires the definition of those immunological markers which must be used to evaluate their potential efficacy. This in turn would mean developing standardized and reproducible trials to evaluate the humoral and cellular responses to HIV and the approval of laboratories which would carry out these immunological determinations. Lastly, the necessary healthcare structures should be set up to carry out the trials in clinical phases in developing countries, and the ethical criteria to be fulfilled in these trials should be defined. Given the large number of current prototypes (table 2), the application of homogeneous evaluation criteria is the only way to reach consistent conclusions which can be extrapolated to all situations.",34.1062986112866,15.024116859836539

Given the healthcare, social and political priorities, this subject is sometimes affected by serious concerns outside the scientific world. These include the social pressure from international organizations and countries devastated by the epidemic and financial pressure from the pharmaceutical companies. Although some of these motives are understandable, given the severity of the situation, these attitudes can also distort the scientific process.

One of the quandaries of veterinary vaccines for some important food animal diseases is that effective vaccines exist, but they are not utilized because current surveillance procedures depend on detection of the host immune responses that the vaccine would induce. Bovine tuberculosis is an example.

Bacteriophages, as objects of intense study, may have a great influence on human life in the future. The phage-display technique, which is based on genetic modifications of phages, allows the display of foreign proteins on their capsids. This method has been successfully used for the development of vaccines with phage capsids as platforms for antigens. Significantly, the creation of a vaccine is not limited by the protein's size. It is possible to obtain phage particles displaying several kinds of antigens, as was shown by, among others, Sathaliyawala et al. [41] in 2006 for HIV p24, Nef and g41 proteins. These proteins were displayed simultaneously on T4 phages' capsids deprived of Hoc protein. In vivo studies showed that such vaccines may elicit a strong humoral and cellular immune response [41] [42] [43] [44] . Because the treatment of animals with these vaccines brought good results and considering the abundant advantages of this technique, it seems an interesting direction for further study. Another application of phage vaccines is anti-cancer immunotherapy. Identified tumour antigens are subsequently displayed on the phage capsid to induce an immunological response. Such a strategy was used, for example, with antigens of 4T1 breast adenocarcinoma. Peptides were displayed on T7 virions and orally applied to mice, inducing a specific immune response. As a result of this response, tumor growth and metastasis were inhibited [45] . The development of anticancer phage-based vaccines seems to be one of the most meaningful applications of phages.

NTD researchers do not use the tools because they lack access to and familiarity with them, and there are no widely publicized examples focusing on diseases that impact the developing world. A series of technical challenges for NTD vaccines have been described recently, including antigen discovery, process development, preclinical development, clinical trials in resource-poor settings and the immune response to NTD infection, including what is commonly referred to as the IgE trap, through which certain individuals, perhaps especially those in endemic regions, may have elevated preexisting IgE antibodies for potential NTD vaccine antigens, leading to increased risk with vaccination [91] . Computational vaccinology cannot currently address all of these challenges; however, the approach described here offers a unique opportunity to address certain hurdles early in the developmental process. Early in the pipeline, antigen discovery using T-cell epitope prediction and ranking, along with candidate epitope triage using cluster analysis and crossreactivity prediction provide valuable leads.

It is important to identify the host innate immune response genetics that are predictors of disease susceptibility and progression. This would help to improve prognostic capabilities and allow identification of patients likely to benefit from aggressive interventions. Such information is also of value in the development of entry criteria for interventional studies. 11 Since immune response might play a role in SARS pathogenesis, one must be cautious of the possibility of enhancement of the disease in immunised subjects. 27 This has indeed occurred for experimental vaccine directed against feline infectious peritonitis virus, which is also a coronavirus. Therefore caution has been urged on developing SARS vaccines. 27 However, given the urgent need for a safe and effective SARS vaccine, multiple strategies for vaccine development have been pursued simultaneously. At least 10 candidate SARS vaccines are at different phases of development. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] These include the development of live-attenuated and inactivated virus vaccine, in addition to other strategies that elicit strong T cell responses, such as DNA-based vaccine and engineered adenovirus vectors, as well as those that elicit production of neutralising antibodies. 11 Subunit vaccines based on S protein fragments and peptides are also being developed. SARS CoV S protein, expressed by attenuated vaccinia virus, has been shown to immunise mice protectively. 30 Similarly, a DNA vaccine encoding the SARS CoV S protein can induce T cell and neutralising antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model. 31 Viral replication can be reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors and protection is mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism. 31 All the experimental testing of candidate SARS vaccines would require an animal model that reproduces SARS symptoms and pathology as in humans. However, no animal model described to date can reliably mimic the respiratory symptoms seen in humans with SARS. 27 Even the macaques model, used initially to fulfil the last of Koch's postulates in confirming SARS CoV as the etiologic agent, 8 does not always reproduce the SARS-like symptoms when infected with SARS CoV. 27 This could be due to macaques not being inbred like mice. Finding a consistent SARS animal model which can be used for testing potential drugs and vaccines is certainly a top research priority.

Is there a specific immunologie reaction by these cells toward uveal antigens that is important in the production of human endogenous uveitis, or is the reactivity observed merely as an epiphenomenon? An equally feasible mechanism for the prolongation of an ocular inflammatory response could be the structural alteration induced by a nonspecific immunologie reaction. In the rabbit the development of systemic immune complex disease, with nonocular antigens, results in a change in ocular vascular permeability (Gamble et al., 1970 Howes and McKay, 1975) . It is conceivable that, once an animal receives this type of insult to its vascular system, the structural alteration of the ocular tissue is such that a chronic uveitis either develops or continues despite the lack of specific immune reactivity toward ocular antigens.",26.80204993455045,11.484060177097236

In contrast, vaccines for important emerging infectious diseases (EID, TABLE 2) are being developed, to a certain extent, by large biotechnology companies, particularly when these companies receive guaranteed purchase agreements or other incentives to accelerate vaccine development. Examples include the development of a vaccine for H7N9 (an emerging avian influenza) by Novartis and Novavax in 2013 [6, 7] and work toward the development of a new MERS-CoV vaccine in 2014 [8] . However, the standard approach to develop new vaccines for emerging (and reemerging) infectious disease threats, which is to implement previously existing vaccine design methodologies such as cloning and expressing the dominant surface antigen [9] , frequently results in the development of vaccines that are only effective when given with strong adjuvants [10] . This approach is particularly unlikely to work for pathogens that have complex lifecycles (such as parasites) or are highly mutable (such as RNA viruses). This article will discuss new, computational approaches that may accelerate and improve the design of vaccines for NTD and EID.",25.58160664037368,11.371325545394672

The success of BCG and rotavirus vaccines given at birth is proof-of-concept that effective and safe neonatal immunization is feasible [126, 127] . A framework to allow discovery of neonatal agespecific adjuvants is needed. Comparing responses of various immune-stimulators in cord and adult blood may not translate to complex adjuvant effects in vivo [128] [129] [130] [131] . Ultimately, answers will only come from human neonatal studies of vaccines containing novel adjuvants. To assist progress, there is a need to define and validate specific neonatal biomarkers of vaccine and adjuvant safety and efficacy. The beneficial effects in neonatal animal models of sugar-based adjuvants such as delta inulin, curdlan, and TDB on neonatal vaccine responses highlight the ability to identify compounds able to enhance neonatal vaccine responses. To understand the specific benefits of these compounds, more research is needed into the differences in immune signaling pathways between newborns and adults. Systems biological analysis of the host response to vaccination has provided new insights into the adult immune response to vaccination [132, 133] . Systems biology approaches employ highthroughput molecular and cellular measurements called 'OMICs' analysis [134] . For example, transcriptomic analyses showed early gene signatures following vaccination were predictive of subsequent measures of immunogenicity for seasonal influenza [135] . These high-dimensional methodologies could be applied to characterization of neonatal vaccine-induced molecular signatures that correspond to protection [79, 136, 137] . The importance of formulation to vaccine effectiveness is often overlooked, and hence there is also a need for research into development of new and improved formulations and stable delivery systems to improve neonatal vaccine immunogenicity. New knowledge will help in the rational design of neonatal vaccines and adjuvants, reduce empiricism and lessen the risk of failed vaccine candidates, thereby expediting the development of effective neonatal vaccines.",26.97311752637811,11.222650762003717

Models that can evaluate the genomic trajectory of particular RNA viruses in reservoir host species are essential to understanding how viral zoonoses are maintained in nature. Additionally, models that incorporate selective pressures (e.g. resources such as food and water, predators, breeding cycles), infection history and the heterogeneity in an animal's ability to maintain and amplify a pathogen can be used to probe how viruses are maintained in their reservoirs and to determine what drives spill over into new nonreservoir species. There is a need for increased surveillance of wildlife diseases and inclusion of this data in model formulation and analysis. Difficulties encountered due to case acquisition and underreporting, and lack of existing wildlife surveillance infrastructure and validated diagnostic tests need to be overcome [152] . Modeling is crucial given that the successful spill over event is rare, and can help drive hypothesis testing that can capture such events in controlled experimental or field settings. With respect to immunological pressures, many unanswered questions need to be addressed with models. For example, what are the mechanisms of the immune response in the wildlife host that lead to a persistent infection or to the possibility of a superspreader? How and why does it differ in the spill over dead-end host that either dies or has no productive infection? How does the immune response differ when a host is infected with a single versus multiple pathogens? What effects do seasonality or climate change have on the immune response and disease susceptibility? What are the drivers of host-switching events that lead to emergence of new disease?

While this approach has been tremendously successful, it has a number of disadvantages: candidate vaccines are largely developed in animal models and then must enter large and expensive clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy; vaccine development also relies on an inconsistent or incomplete understanding of correlates of protection. Current issues that affect vaccine development, particularly for complex and hypervariable organisms, require a shift away from empirical approaches toward directed vaccine development approaches that capitalize on: cutting edge technologies; current understanding of innate and adaptive immune function; an increased awareness of vaccine safety; ability to predict and reduce adverse events; the effect of host-pathogen interactions; and the influence of the microbiome.

However, the recent emergence of the highly virulent H5N1 avian influenza virus in Southeast Asia has served as a wakeup call, reminding the medical community that novel influenza A viruses can unexpectedly enter the human population and that even the currently circulating seasonal strains are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Influenza A viruses, far from being benign respiratory pathogens, are a major public health problem that calls for a serious and sustained research response. An essential part of that process is the development of laboratory animal models of influenza virus infection for the study of pathogenesis and the evaluation of new drugs and vaccines. As described in this paper, a number of animal models have been developed, but many gaps remain. Many of the current models remain incompletely characterized, and none has been employed to its full potential. New and better models are needed to provide more accurate answers to critical questions in pathogenesis and therapy. It is hoped that this paper will contribute to the better use of laboratory animal models to combat the continuing threat of influenza.

However, the recent emergence of the highly virulent H5N1 avian influenza virus in Southeast Asia has served as a wake-up call, reminding the medical community that novel influenza A viruses can unexpectedly enter the human population and that even the currently circulating seasonal strains are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Influenza A viruses, far from being benign respiratory pathogens, are a major public health problem that calls for a serious and sustained research response. An essential part of that process is the development of laboratory animal models of influenza virus infection for the study of pathogenesis and the evaluation of new drugs and vaccines. As described in this paper, a number of animal models have been developed, but many gaps remain. Many of the current models remain incompletely characterized, and none has been employed to its full potential.

Second, pathological lesions and antigen expression indicated by IHC were detected after the mice challenged by MERS-CoV, although significant humoral and cellular immunity was elicited by the rNTD vaccination.

The development of a downregulating immune response to the epitopes shared between the pathogen and the host may be the best way of treating an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry. 107 Unfortunately, this method is not straightforward. Recently, a large number of published case reports of immunologic late reactions to vaccines raised the hypothesis that specific vaccines containing adjuvants are responsible for autoimmune diseases, especially in genetically susceptible patients. The entity autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants describes the role of various environmental factors in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases. Of these factors, those entailing immune adjuvant activity, such as infectious agents, silicone, aluminium salts and others, were associated with defined and nondefined immune-mediated diseases both in animal models and in humans. 108 Understanding the mechanisms of molecular mimicry may allow future research to be directed towards uncovering the initiating infectious agent as well as recognizing the self-determinant.

Therefore, vaccination with recombinant MVs was initially considered exclusively for young infants at an age when MV vaccination is recommended, thus replacing the standard vaccine with a bi-or multivalent vaccine protecting not only against measles, but also against other important diseases such as malaria. Such a regimen is certainly still a preferred option, and care has been taken to ascertain that in animal models various transgenes in MV do not hamper the immunogenicity against measles del Valle et al. 2007 ). However, measles immunity can be boosted in children who are preimmune after a first vaccination, particularly when the boost is given as an aerosol (Bennett et al. 2002) . Thus, it was probably wrong to assume that the immune reactions against measles in young infants, where the immune system is still immature, is necessarily similar in older children and adults. Since, for example, MV-based AIDS vaccines should be given much later, before sexual activity begins, it was important to ascertain, for the time being in animal models, that preimmunity from vaccination with standard MV vaccine does not prevent a boost with recombinant MV. In fact, boosts resulted in enhancement of immune responses against MV and induction of immune responses against the transgenes (del Valle et al. 2007; see Fig. 4 ).",26.946045939547464,11.950911520469115

Plenty of treatment modalities were developed on the basis of animal experimentations. Meanwhile, there is an increasing number of failed clinical trials, particularly on chronic and complex diseases that biased from the results of studies on inappropriate animal models [4, 5] . It is time to ask whether animal models truly predict human health conditions. While validity and acceptability of current successful trials and guidelines are debated in the 21st century because they are not patient tailored, how could we rely on animal models as an appropriate predictor of human conditions? Simplifying a complex system is inevitable to study the basis of a complex phenomenon. However, simplified models do not reflect all the properties of complex systems [4, 6] . When an animal model is used as the basis of a clinical trial, it is needed to mimic the complex properties of the patients. Otherwise, animal models might be misleading; consequently, a large number of therapeutic modalities might have lost in translation [7] . This study was therefore undertaken to provide shreds of evidence against the validity of animal models. It has been systematically discussed why the authors believe that it is time to re-evaluate the validity of animal experimentations. Although plenty of state-of-the-art disease modeling techniques have been introduced recently, their acceptance and application in the medical science society are scarce; nevertheless validity of these modern modeling techniques needs further evaluation as well. There is a gap between bench and bedside that, unfortunately, has not been appropriately filled with the animal models.

The translation medicine in this point has to deal with this problem in order to support further and smooth development of PPPM. It is absolutely essential the experts in all fields of medicine, and beyond, are aware of the described problems.

It is now possible to have fully defined attenuating mutations clearly mapped on the virus genome. This logical design of vaccine strains can help ensure that the risk arising from a reversion to virulence is greatly minimised. The logical design of vaccines can also allow for immunomodulatory genes to be removed from an attenuated virus, while ensuring that protective antigens are not accidentally removed, hence increasing its efficacy in stimulating the immune system of the vaccinated animal. A great advantage of a designed vaccine is the ability to include their use in conjunction with epidemiological surveillance systems.

Sometimes additional postmarketing studies, also known as Phase 4, are required subsequent to licensure. Pre-clinical studies may include proof-ofconcept studies in animals to demonstrate immunogenicity and evidence of efficacy following a live virus challenge; for influenza and RSV vaccines these studies are typically performed in small animals such as mice, cotton rats, and/or ferrets (see Table 1 for summary). For RSV vaccines, animals should ideally be challenged with viruses that represent both subtype A and B viruses since it is expected that an effective vaccine will need to provide immunity against both subtypes. The need for an adjuvant to enhance or modify the immune response can also be justified using these preclinical tests. Repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats or rabbits may be needed as well as reproductive toxicology studies (if the vaccine is intended for use in a maternal immunization program). Pre-clinical testing of influenza and RSV vaccines in animal models also includes studies to demonstrate the attenuated phenotype and stability of live virus vaccines.

Examples include: (1) viruses that exhibit extensive genetic variations (eg, influenza); (2) viruses that evolved multiple mechanisms for evading host immune detection and response (eg, HCV and HSV); (3) viruses that integrate their genomes in that of the host (eg, HIV); (4) viruses that are capable of developing latency (HSV). Some factors stem from the inability of the host to protect against infection (and reinfection) due to the inadequacy of the immune response (eg, RSV). Other factors that are unrelated to both virus and host include the lack of animal models that are suitable for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine candidates and economical considerations. Early antiviral vaccine success stories (eg, smallpox, rabies, and yellow fever) were based on empirical efforts in which vaccines were derived from either a live attenuated form of the virus or inactivated whole virus. It is clear that such approaches are not enough to address the current challenges. Developing an effective vaccine against many of the currently challenging viruses would require an integrative effort from scientists representing various disciplines. For example, public health studies would be needed to assess the disease burden in different populations in order to define the most vulnerable ones. Virological studies would be important for generating viral vaccine strains that lack immune evasion capacity, for example. Immunologists would define which arms of the immune response are needed to achieve protection. Bioinformaticians would need to work very closely with immunologists in order to transform high-throughput data and analyses into concrete, useful knowledge. Structural analyses would help in identifying important immune targets and how to rationally design immunogens that elicit maximal immune responses to such targets. Vaccinologists would then assess vaccine candidates in preclinical and clinical trials. Finally, engaging the pharmaceutical industry would be essential for scaling up the production of the final product.",29.574266553864405,11.733734900088045

Most recently, systems vaccinology has been used to study the immune responses to vaccines against yellow fever virus (YFV). 172, 173 Although the YFV vaccine has been used in humans since 1937, little was known about how the vaccine protected from infection. With the advent of systems vaccinology, scientists examined comprehensively the initial molecular signatures in individuals vaccinated against YFV not only to elucidate the mechanisms behind the vaccine's efficacy but also to establish predictive correlates for the later development of protective responses. 172, 173 Systems vaccinology was also used to establish the predictive correlates of a protective antibody response after administration of the trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine, 174 and similar approaches have been applied to the study of immune responses to Brucella melitensis and fungal infections. [175] [176] [177] Ideally, subsequent development of these models will define inherent and infection-mediated perturbations in the genetic regulatory networks of the host and will enable predictions about how the host will respond to vaccines. Based on these models, we can design vaccines that induce optimal immune responses without toxic effects, thus improving vaccine safety profiles. 75, 178 Once the correlates of vaccine-induced protective immune responses against infection are well defined with the help of systems vaccinology, new methodologies must be identified that can apply this information to the design and development of new vaccines. The likeliness that commonalities exist among many different vaccines regarding the correlates of successful immune responses will drive faster and more accurate ways of screening vaccine candidates for their effectiveness. For example, Pulendran et al 179 predicted the development of a vaccine chip microarray, similar to the Mam-maPrint prognostic chip that was developed for breast cancer, which will be able to predict the immunogenicity of any vaccine. Although this specific technology may so far still exist only in theory, several systems biology approaches are being used currently to aid with antigen discovery and vaccine development. Phage display is one such technique that enables the screening and identification of unique molecules with highly specific affinities for targets of interest. 180 This approach works by introducing a foreign sequence at an appropriate site within a bacteriophage coat protein gene that results in the display of that protein on the phage surface. If random sequences are inserted, then it is possible to obtain a library containing a large number of distinct proteins, each displayed on a different phage. By immobilizing a DNA or protein target to a solid surface, libraries can be ''panned'' for phages that recognize the target. After washing, phages that do not bind to the target will be washed away, whereas specific phages can be eluted and used to produce more phage, thus enriching the population for relevant binding phages and enabling the isolation of specific proteins of interest for use in subsequent applications. 181 Phage display is a powerful technique because of its many applications for vaccine and drug development. One application of phage display technology is the identification of the epitope repertoire of antibodies in postvaccination human sera. To this end, Khurana et al 182 used H5N1 influenza virus whole genome-fragment phage display libraries to evaluate the quality of antibody responses in humans after immunization with a novel virus-like particle vaccine. This approach also enabled the authors to determine the most appropriate dosage of the vaccine to induce the desired antibody repertoire and will help them to evaluate the usefulness of incorporating an adjuvant into the vaccine.",26.085170852854844,10.867674102088063

Systems biology is the integrative analysis of all the components involved in a complex biological process. 38 It includes the analysis of the genes (eg, transcriptomics), the molecules (eg, proteomics) and cells (eg, multiparameter flow cytometry) that were ""perturbed"" in the course of a certain biological process such as an active immune response. 38 Systems vaccinology refers to the use of systems biological approaches in analyzing human immune responses to vaccination. 38 Advantages of using systems vaccinology approaches include; (1) gaining new insights about the mechanisms of antiviral vaccine-mediated immunity; (2) defining new molecular signatures triggered by the immune response to various vaccines and adjuvants; (3) the potential use of those molecular signatures as alternative correlates of protection. 38 Moreover, applying systems biology approaches highlighted the important role played by the early innate immune responses in triggering adaptive immune responses to various antiviral vaccines. This role is usually overlooked when assessing the effectiveness of such vaccines using traditional correlates of protection (Table 15 .1). Analysis of the immune response to the yellow fever YF-17D vaccine was one of the earliest examples of utilizing systems vaccinology and it provided a proof of concept for such approach. 39 The approach was later applied to other antiviral vaccines such as those against influenza. 40 In summary, these exciting advances highlight the potential of systems biology to transform our understanding of not only how antiviral vaccines work, but also the mechanisms of immune regulation in general.",28.36497444225045,10.489893002405188

Studies in the mouse model have suggested that vaccine responses may be compromised in these age groups. The development of the murine immune system may not provide an appropriate model for evaluating immune responses in these two age groups. To evaluate vaccine immune responses in the neonate, and to address questions regarding possible interactions between vaccines and maternal antibodies, large animal models may be much more appropriate [172À174] . However, other than mice, there have been very few investigations of vaccine responses in geriatric animals [175, 176] . For the screening of adjuvants, the horse could provide geriatric populations [177] . An appropriate animal model is also needed for the development of mucosal vaccines. Disease protection against a wide variety of pathogens that invade through mucosal surfaces could be achieved by mucosal vaccination. Difficulties associated with efficient vaccine delivery and weak immune responses following mucosal immunization made the induction of protective immune responses at mucosal surfaces an elusive goal. Thus, for the evaluation of mucosal vaccine delivery technologies, effective and safe mucosal adjuvants, and the characterization of mucosal immune responses, an appropriate animal model is required. In mice, intranasal vaccination may be associated with inhalation and ingestion of vaccine antigens. This makes it difficult to discriminate between intranasal, oral, and intrapulmonary vaccination. However, larger animals like the pig or the cow can be used for the controlled delivery of vaccines to the nasal passages [178, 179] . The nasal passages of these animals more closely resemble that of humans than do those of the mouse. Surgical models have also been useful for screening a variety of mucosal vaccine delivery technologies and potential mucosal adjuvants [180, 181] .",37.45305867947119,17.252065918693365

Several potential approaches are feasible. The killed whole virus vaccine is attractive because of the availability of a robust cell culture system that yields a large quantity of virus particles. Attenuated virus vaccines are still unattainable because the parameters for virus attenuation are not yet well defined. Ultimately, the attenuation of viral virulence needs to be verified preclinically in animal models. Recombinant subunit vaccines consisting of the spike protein alone or in combination with other viral proteins can be prepared by using the recombinant proteins themselves or delivered by virus vectors or as DNA plasmids. These approaches are technically feasible. However, the timetable for the development of any of these vaccines is lengthy, and the potential success of vaccine development may be hindered by the lack of accessibility to animal models and a suitable population base for clinical trials. At the present time, the macaque monkey is an acceptable animal model. However, with the SARS epidemic virtually over worldwide, it will be difficult to test the efficacy of these vaccines. Eventually, 'ring' vaccination (vaccination of the at-risk populations around the exposed people) may have to be attempted. Nevertheless, vaccine development is clearly a top priority, as vaccines are the main weapons in the arsenal against future outbreaks, whether they are natural or man-made (i.e. bioterrorism) in origin.",42.38318330998691,16.297148134156217

One may pay particular attention to differences in how a pathogen is delivered in nature (i.e., mosquito, superficial dermis, salivary proteins) and how this may or may not translate depending on how we deliver in the context of vaccination (i.e., needle, intramuscular or subcutaneous, no salivary proteins). Note added after review: Back correlations between efficacious vaccines and mechanisms of protection should be carried out to derive correlates of protection. Alternative approaches using in vitro organoids and ex vivo studies should be used to supplement live animal models, although their role in supporting product development is uncertain. Several other parameters of animal models can be poorly reflective of the human infection and disease experience. For example, the time course of infection in animal models can be remarkably different from humans. Further, lethal challenge models (e.g., Nipah) do not provide endpoints suitable for translation to clinical trials. Model relevance was also discussed in the context of a Zika pregnancy model in immunocompetent mice, in which the infected dams did not get viremia and there was no detectable vertical transmission of virus, yet there was virtually 100% fetal demise. Monoclonal antibody blocking studies indicated that, despite the absence of productive infection, the pathology was apparently caused by virus, raising the possibility of fetal demise due to specific placental pathology [7] . There would be great value in developing high quality, standardized animal models and challenge strains of particular pathogens that are broadly accepted. Following Good Laboratory Practices within high bio-containment required for handling some pathogens is difficult and could impact countermeasure development efforts in these areas. Note added after review: Emphasis should be placed on working with biocontainment labs to get as close to GLP compliance as possible. Once a candidate vaccine or drug has entered into clinical testing or has been proven safe and effective it would valuable to go back and assess how pre-clinical animal models supported or did not support informed programmatic decision making.",34.77905876075405,15.406731843176605

Although a vaccine against TB, BCG, exists and is given to children in most countries at birth, it is not effective at preventing infection and subsequent disease.

To date, the only wellestablished indicator is a vaccine-induced reduction in bacterial load using animal models before they go into human trials.

In the context of infectious diseases for which it is not feasible or ethical to perform clinical trials, animal studies play an additional role. Under the FDA's Animal Efficacy Rule (""Animal Rule"") therapeutics against rare, emerging, or virulent agents can achieve regulatory approval provided efficacy is demonstrated in two animal models (one of which must be a non-rodent species) that display clinical illness representative of human disease (46). The ideal animal model is permissive to infection and reproduces the clinical course and pathology observed in humans. An algorithm for the development of animal models is presented in Figure 1 . Small animal models offer several advantages over NHP's including availability of animals and species specific reagents, ease of handling, reduced cost, and the ability to use sufficient numbers for statistical analysis. Especially with coronaviruses, rodents vary in susceptibility and may be semi-permissive to infection and refractory to clinical disease (47) , even so, they can be used to screen countermeasures (48) (49) (50) (51) . Thus, to generate a rodent model that displays clinical disease it may be necessary to adapt the virus to enhance virulence for the rodent host or generate transgenic animals. Pathogenesis in these models should be fully characterized because the disease mechanism of an adapted virus or in a transgenic animal may be different from that in the natural host ( Figure 1 ).",32.13368568248492,11.914794296020563

Despite intensive research since the 1980s there are no vaccines or drugs that can successfully prevent or eradicate the disease. The major barriers to HIV vaccine development include the variability of HIV, lack of a suitable animal model , lack of correlates of protective immunity , lack of natural protective immune response s against HIV, and the reservoir of infected cells conferred by integration of HIV's genome into the host [ 1 ] . Within the main HIV-1 subgroup, Group M, there are nine clades as well as dozens of recombinant forms, and clades can vary up to 42 % at the amino acid level [ 15 ] . A vaccine immunogen derived from a particular clade may therefore be ineffective against other clades, posing a signifi cant obstacle to the creation of a global HIV vaccine. Importantly, one of the principal barriers limiting discovery of an HIV vaccine has been that protective immune response s tend to be polyclonal and involve antibodies directed to several different epitopes; thus, antigenic variation among the different HIV-1 isolates has been the major problem in the development of an effective vaccine against AIDS [ 1 ] . Although several 3D structures of HIV-1 envelope protein fragments have been determined, this knowledge has not yet led to the design of an HIV-1 vaccine. The mechanism by which an HIV vaccine might confer protection therefore remains uncertain, and an effective vaccine may require induction of an immune response that is signifi cantly different from that seen during natural infection [ 16 ] . Overall, current vaccination strategies have not helped in developing a vaccine for HIV; hence novel ""out-of-the-box"" strategies are essential in developing an HIV vaccine [ 17 ] .",38.34015972227625,15.758014970856607

At birth, puppies have few circulating antibodies in their bloodstream. Only about 3% of the antibodies they need to protect them from disease cross the placenta and are present at the moment of birth. Antibodies ingested passively in colostrum protect puppies until they can generate their own immune response at about 4 weeks of age. Puppies usually are immunized several times, with a 2-to 4-week interval, to ensure a good immune response. The factors that can prevent a good response are (1) our inability to recognize exactly at what time the animal becomes capable of responding to an antigen introduced by vaccination and (2) the presence of antibody from the dam, which will neutralize antigens introduced with the vaccine. Immunization of puppies is therefore a balancing act in which we try to promote the pup's own immune response without allowing the concentration of antibody derived from the dam to fall so low as to risk the pup being exposed to disease without adequate protection. Because there is no good way to know whether or not a pup has responded to vaccination or whether it still has protection against disease from its dam, it is not recommended to expose pups to strange people or dogs much before vaccination at about 8 weeks of age. For most vaccines, it is recom-mended that pups be immunized at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age. Some people prefer to begin vaccinating their pups at 6 weeks of age; the manufacturer's recommendation always should be followed. The occasional puppy does not respond to vaccination; measurement of antibody concentration in serum 2 weeks after the final vaccination in the series may allow a veterinarian to determine whether the puppy is adequately protected or should receive another vaccination before the annual booster as an adult.",26.322770371461115,10.626590962507795

Animal models are widely used, but there are frequent debates about how animal models translate to action in humans. 100 Whole fresh blood with antigen plus adjuvant can be followed by monitoring of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b or IFN-g release by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 101 Assays used in the development of vaccines and associated adjuvants include stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine productiondeither Th1 (IL-2, IFN-g, and TNF-a) or Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10); quantitation of the expression of cell activation markers on cell surface such as CD25, CD69, CD80, and CD86 by using a fluorescenceactivated cell sorter (FACS) 102 ; quantitation of different lymphocyte subpopulations by FACS, e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16/CD56, CD19, CD20, and CD45; augmentation of NK cell cytotoxicity; stimulation of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a production by macrophages in response to LPS; and stimulation of antibody plaqueeforming cells and antibody production. In vivoeassociated assays include stimulation of antibody titers by specific antigens and determination of Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles. 102, 103 There is a gradual move toward more systems-based approaches in assessing vaccine efficacy, and some applications of omics technologies are also included in this. The most widely used technology to date is the application of microarray technology to examine RNA expression posttreatment. 97e99 In addition, microchip technologies can be applied to well-established assays such as ELISA and the enzyme-linked immunospot assay. 104, 105 The application of microarray technologies has been recently reviewed. 106 Another commonly applied assay uses Luminex technology. In this case, beads bearing either single DNA strands or antibodies are introduced into the sample in a 96-well-plate format and the analytes of interest are captured. 107 The technology is highly suitable for quantifying response to an antigen via measurement of an array of cytokines and allows systems biology approaches to be used in assessing vaccine response. 108 Further down the omics ladder, the application of proteomics in adjuvant research does not appear to be widespread. However, the use of metabolomics to find lowmolecular-weight metabolite markers of vaccine effects is just beginning to emerge. Metabolomics simply aims to profile all the metabolites within a biological fluid or tissue. In effect this means that somewhere between 200 and several thousand metabolites are monitored depending on the instrument technology used for screening.",32.35510165681975,13.935253418651103

Development of these vaccines was enabled by clinical and animal model studies showing that antibodies directed against a specific viral target antigen (e.g., the HBV surface antigen or the HPV L1 protein) were implicated in protection. In addition, molecular biologic approaches enabled the derivation of fully recombinant vaccine antigens (such as those developed using a limited set of defined antigens of Bordetella pertussis), including genetically modified versions of bacterial toxins that maintain their proper antigenic structures but are no longer toxic. However, for many of the pathogens for which vaccines do not currently exist, application of these recombinant DNA technology-enabled strategies are insufficient due to incomplete understanding of the pathogen antigens that would elicit a protective host immune response.

Considering that most novel vaccine technologies (other than killed or attenuated vaccines) need to adapt the current production processes, many vaccines will never develop further enough to reach market. Nonetheless, animal vaccine research is a very attractive research fi eld with many advantages and complexity over human vaccine fi eld. Firstly, due the larger number of target animal species or segments (ruminant livestock, poultry, porcine, equine, companion animals, aquaculture, and other animal vaccines), secondly, the lack of deep knowledge in the immune mechanisms and lack of reagents adds more difficulties if immune response characterization is needed.

In addition, the standardization of immune assays used in the assessment of innate and adaptive immune response is essential for the comparative analysis of such vaccines.

In contrast, vaccine strategies have been limited due to the absence of robust animal models. Typically examined in mice, the presence of specific charge and glycosylation difference between human and rodent DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV, prevent infection (Peck et al., 2015). Therefore, the traditional approaches to study pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy have been stunted.

For example, the immune response to one antigen may dominate or interfere with the others in the vaccine. In endemic areas, many people suffering from helminth infections are polyparasitized [75], making a coinfection animal model critical to vaccine development. Currently, multiple animal models are used as surrogates for human Ascaris and Trichuris infections, including rodents, pigs and nonhuman primates, with rodents and pigs used most frequently [23,41,42,45–49,76–78]. Rodent models, in other words, mice and rats, are more attractive than pigs or nonhuman primates for initial immunogenicity and efficacy studies as their small size and ease of handling allow larger numbers of animals to be evaluated concurrently. Additionally, genetically defined inbred strains allow identification of genetic backgrounds responsible for susceptibility and resistance to parasites. Several strains, including AKR, SCID and Nude, have been shown to be susceptible to T. muris, developing patent infections [49]. In contrast, while A. suum larvae migrate through the liver and lungs of C57BL/6-infected mice, to date, mice cannot support the development of adult worms, nor patent A. suum infections [79]. Nonetheless, several A. suum antigens identified by screening with immune serum from pigs have been shown to reduce lung larval burdens in susceptible mice, suggesting that protective immune responses in susceptible mice correlate with protective response in pigs [41,42,44–48]. Since C57BL/6 mice infected with a low dose of T. muris develop a TH1-skewed immune response and a susceptible phenotype [80], this mouse strain could potentially serve as an initial coinfection model for evaluating a pan-helminthic vaccine against Ascaris and Trichuris infections. Furthermore, mice would be invaluable in evaluating regulatory mandated immunogenicity testing of antigen/adjuvant combinations and future potency testing of a clinical vaccine [81]. Ultimately, to thoroughly evaluate a coformulated vaccine, both mice and pigs may be necessary to establish sufficient protection data to advance a potential vaccine candidate into product development. Pigs offer some promise as a laboratory vaccine model [82] although they have not yet been used extensively for evaluating T. suis.

In 2010, 2 murine models susceptible to CCHF virus were published, with deletions in either STAT-1.39 or the type-I interferon receptor.40 The STAT-1 knockout mice exhibit signaling defects in their response to all 3 major types of interferon (type I, IFN-α and IFN-β; type II, IFN-γ; and type III, IFN-λ) that leads to a complete abolishment of the intracellular interferon response.41 For the efficacy studies with the MVA-NP10200 vaccine candidate, mice deficient in the type-I interferon receptor were used since these have less immune deficiency. This was considered essential for testing vaccination approaches as IFN-γ is a major cytokine involved in the adaptive immune response.42,43 For the immunogenicity of the MVA-NP vaccine, we compared the immune responses in mice with the type-I interferon receptor deficiency and the parental wild-type strain. No differences were observed in either the antibody or cell-mediated response, demonstrating that the knockout mice elicited similar responses.

live bacterial vaccine strains followed by a classical method would be achieved by conducting multiple passages of microorganisms in suitable systems and by selecting desirable mutants,0.20567542997789018,0.7465875744819641,2.0404675006866455,d1261d78-cac2-477b-9b3c-e95096275c1d,noncomm_use_subset/A review of vaccine development and research for industry animals in Korea,"Live bacterial vaccines consist of a small quantity of attenuated bacteria that elicit good immune responses similar to that provoked by natural infection. Although attenuated bacteria are able to infect and multiply in the vaccinated host, they no longer are capable of causing clinical disease as the result of impairment of biological function of virulent determinants [36]. Immune reactions derived from vaccination with live bacteria last longer than those of immunity generated by inactivated bacteria. The major advantage of live vaccine is a broader scope and duration of protection because the animals are exposed to all stages of the replicating bacteria. However, it is critical to ensure that live bacterial vaccine is neither over- or under-attenuated in target animals. Whereas under-attenuated strains may be pathogenic and consequently causes their natural diseases, over-attenuation would not elicit enough amount of an immune response to be an effective vaccine [19,36,48]. Since live bacteria vaccines can elicit good levels of both humoral and cellular immunity, this property per se makes live vaccines highly desirable. Creation of live bacterial vaccine strains followed by a classical method would be achieved by conducting multiple passages of microorganisms in suitable systems and by selecting desirable mutants. This method is readily applicable for most target pathogens to be created as attenuated vaccine strains. However, there has been relatively little success in developing attenuated bacteria by such a classical method. For this reason, relatively mild selective pressure on bacteria during in vitro passage enables bacteria to temporarily suppress virulence determinants and then restart their expression of such determinants in vivo. Once development of such vaccines were not technically feasible for most bacteria due to lack of proper tools for doing so, however, currently advanced genetic techniques make practical the development of attenuated strains. This strategy provides opportunities to create desirable mutants of various types of bacteria, through manipulating a target gene with various genetic techniques, including gene-insertion, deletion, disruption, replacement, and point mutation. The best targets for a bacterial genome are the genes associated with virulence determinants, biosynthesis, and regulatory genes which are critical for bacterial survival. Interestingly, from the standpoint of creating a vaccine strain, deletion of virulence-associated genes in bacteria may be problematic since protective immunity is sometimes desired against the very virulence-associated protein. In such a case, this strain cannot provide good immunity as a vaccine strain. Chemically altered bacterial vaccine contains modified bacteria that have been grown in media supplemented with the proper level of a chemical that provokes mutation of bacteria, changing the ability of bacteria to cause diseases. This method would be another option for developing weakened bacteria and followed by a proper screening method that is suitable for selecting desirable mutants. Alternatively, temperature sensitive mutants can be generated by selection of the mutants which lost their ability to grow at animal body's temperature but can grow at the temperature present in ocular or nasal cavity. In general, killed vaccines for Salmonella are able to stimulate strong immune response, but offer a relatively low degree of protection as compared to live attenuated vaccine. They are also difficult to apply to large flocks, requiring a lot of labor for vaccination [49]. Thus, the live form of attenuated Salmonella vaccine effectively stimulates better cellular immunity and IgA than those of killed vaccine.",26.509865291271105,11.090038650804482

Vaccine clinical assays measuring humoral and cellular immune responses developed early in a program will likely evolve as clinical development progresses or as the scientific knowledge base of the pathogen and relevant immunology broadens. As improvements in technology occur over time, early vaccine assays are often re-designed and bridged to assays with higher throughput, multiplexed detection, reduction of sample volumes, and automation to support testing of large numbers of specimens for late-stage clinical trials.28–35 Often, a variety of tests are evaluated early in the program and, based on the usefulness of the data, a down-selection occurs so that the most relevant few remain to support large Phase 3 clinical trials and licensure of the vaccine.2,35,36",27.139095939825246,10.836921892732972

Our results are consistent with an earlier report, wherein PLGA encapsulation of vaccine Ags (hepatitis B core antigen) and adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A) failed to increase an antibody response.79 Another advantage of NP-based vaccines is their ability to reduce greatly the required vaccine dose.

The use of epitopes also helps to mitigate potential safety concerns stemming from the use of intact recombinant proteins that may have undesired biological activity (e.g., enzymes, immunomodulators, cross-reactivity, toxins, etc.).

Taxonomic classification and detection through DNA/RNA-based inclusivity assays (i.e., using techniques such as PCR to detect the presence of a pathogen) can be designed using fragmented and incomplete genomes (e.g., SD and HQ sequences). Fully resolved ORFs (CC) further enable the development of immunological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA), for protein-based detection, and obtaining a complete genome opens the door to a plethora of additional downstream applications, including the design of exclusivity tests, the establishment of reverse genetics systems, and the design of robust forensics protocols.

Poly I:C binds to TLR3 and enhances robust CMI and potent type I interferon response. However, the major draw-back of stability and toxicity issues need to be addressed before proceeding to clinical application of dsRNAs. Recently, a clinically safe dsRNA, PolyI:C analogue (Ampligen), was investigated as an adjuvant for intranasal H5N1 Influenza virus vaccines (36). Bacterial flagellin, a TLR 5 agonist, is a known immunostimulator that induces high antibody titer, and mixed Th1 and Th2 type immune responses. The D1 portion of flagellin binds to TLR 5 and can be expressed in a fusion protein with selected vaccine antigens. Due to this characteristic of flagellin, a major advantage of the TLR5-dependent adjuvant is that a fusion protein can co-deliver antigen and TLR5 agonist to the APC (37). Thus, flagellin fusion proteins are suitable adjuvants for the development of vaccines to induce robust antigen-specific immune responses. Indeed, a flagellin/ hemagglutinin-based vaccine (VAX128) and a flagellin/matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) vaccine (VAX102) are in clinical trials of vaccines against influenza (38, 39).

Currently, the ferret is thought to be the most suitable animal model for respiratory influenza virus infection56 since ferrets are physiologically susceptible to wild type influenza viruses due to a similar respiratory tract and are able to transmit the virus once infected. As mentioned previously, ferrets display similar clinical disease as humans following influenza infection which include fever, weight loss, and sneezing and these positive features have been well discussed previously2124263056. As well, the ferret has been shown to have similar features as human in regard to IFN pathway function and is potential model for the study of human IFN-gamma signalling2457. Although the ferret is an appropriate model, it is imperative to be mindful of the disparities between animal models and the nature human infection to have an accurate assessment of research findings especially from ferret-influenza studies. During experimental influenza infections in animal models, a specific and known amount of virus is administered to the animal in a controlled manor, usually by intranasal inoculation. Modeling the infectious behaviour of a virus is more predictable when the infection route and dose are controlled. This is in contrast to natural infection where humans are infected with an unknown amount of virus in an unknown route, which must be considered when extrapolating results from animal model studies. Most significantly, ferrets as well as other animal models used in influenza studies are typically ‘Specific Pathogen Free' (SPF). In this case, the ferrets are determined to be influenza free prior to study initiation. Unlike humans who have been previously exposed to various subtypes of influenza viruses, ferrets used in influenza studies are completely naïve to the virus. The nuances of the immune response subsequent to multiple influenza infections, such as the phenomenon of original antigenic sin58, has only started to be elucidated in the ferret model53 and much work is still required to have a full understanding of the effect of sequential influenza infection on the specific immune response mounted. Furthermore, since the influenza virus is subject to both genetic shift and genetic drift35, the clinical manifestations of sequential virus infections by a virus that undergone multiple genetic drifts would differ from a response of a virus that had undergone a significant genetic shift as that of the H1N1 2009 pandemic variant.",35.52896581132487,13.919116427637602

The present conventional approach for vaccine development relies on antigen expression, in sufficient amount, from in vitro culture models; however, many antigens, while expressed sufficiently, may not be good candidates for vaccine. With these conventional approaches, it has not been possible to control different types of outbreaks of viral pathogens, such as recent avian and swine influenza strains, due to their time-consuming development process. Hence, the rapid in silico informatics-based approach has gained much popularity with the recent advancement in the sequencing of many pathogen genomes and protein sequence databases.8 The “vaccinomics” approach has already proven to be essential for combating diseases such as multiple sclerosis,9 malaria,10 and tumors.11 However, these methods of vaccine development usually work through the identification of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) ligands and T cell epitopes,12 which specify the selection of the potent vaccine candidates associated with the transporter of antigen presentation (TAP) molecules.13–16 Allergenicity assessment is one of the vital steps in the development of a peptide vaccine because when we provide the vaccine into the human body, it is detected as a foreign substance. As a result, inflammation occurs, demonstrating an allergic reaction. For the prediction of a B-cell epitope, hydrophilicity is an important criterion which is usually in the beta turns region. These assessments strengthen the possibility of the vaccine candidates.

During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2014–2016, thousands of people were infected and many of them died due to the viral infection [1]. EVD is generally considered as an endemic disease in Africa. However, its spread can be broadened through travel to all parts of the world. It is known to be transmitted from humans, bats, rodents, and chimpanzees to humans. Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family [2]. Ebola virus has a negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 different proteins and is surrounded by an envelope that contains the virally expressed glycoprotein (GP). There are five species of Ebola virus including, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, all of which were named after the places where they were first discovered [3]. Ebola virus GP is associated with viral attachment to the host cell receptor prior to viral entry into the cells [45]. To date, neutralizing antibodies targeting Ebola virus GP have been reported to be somewhat effective at reducing the severity of Ebola virus infection and disease progression in animal models and humans. For example, when Ebola virus-infected monkeys were treated within 24 hours following Ebola virus challenge with ZMAb (composed of three monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] against Ebola virus GP), all survived from Ebola virus infection, while all monkeys without ZMAb treatment died within five days of viral infection [67] Furthermore, ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) treatment is known to be effective at reducing mortality rates in patients infected with Ebola virus [8].

Some important molecules are involved in this process. For example, in Leishmania infantum infection, Dectin-1 and mannose receptor, two kinds of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) expressed on macrophages, respectively activate Sykp47phox and arachidonic acid-NADPH oxidase signaling pathways, and they are crucial for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and also trigger Syk-coupled signaling for caspase-1 induced IL-1β release. In contrast, specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin receptor 3 (SIGNR3), another kind of CLRs, helps parasite resilience through inhibition of the leukotriene (LTB) 4-IL-1β axis. Therefore, CLRs are key modulators for macrophage polarization, and are served as potential targets for prevention as well as treatment of Leishmania infantum infection 37. Arg1 is not only an important marker of M2 phenotype macrophages but also a regulator of the immune response in parasite infestation. A study using myeloid cell restricted Arg1 deficiency Schistosoma mansoni infection model suggested that Arg1 appeared to be a key mediator for the development of helminth infestation through restraining both unrestricted Th2-mediated fibrotic pathology and intestinal damage associated with increased Th1/Th17 cytokines, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 2 levels, and endotoxemia38, 39. However, it is not a generalized effect in the pathogenesis of parasite infestation.

In addition, the ability of Cas13d to process its own crRNAs from a crRNA array means that multiple crRNAs targeting different regions (e.g. Fig. 3E , and PAC-MAN-T6 in Fig. 5A ) could be delivered simultaneously 9 , further reducing the chances of viral escape. As a further advantage, we demonstrate a potential pan-coronavirus strategy to target not only viruses that circulate in humans, but also those that currently are found in animal reservoirs that might transfer to humans to cause disease. If the crRNAs targeting these viruses can be tested and validated before they ever infect humans, we can greatly accelerate the development of countermeasures for future emergent threats.",23.832861808909847,9.57322821993714
