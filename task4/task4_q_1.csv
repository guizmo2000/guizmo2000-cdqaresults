In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",31.049425877675215,9.968033145756204

The Hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the first drug repurposed with excellent results in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, but further, more extended studies, with a higher number of patients, are needed to confirm these results. Besides its limitations, repositioning clinical trials are still an attractive strategy: they may facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they may reduce the costs and time to reach the market; there is an existing pharmaceutical supply chain for formulation and distribution; and there is the possibility of combinations with other drugs in treatments that are more effective than monotherapy.

Indeed, one review stated that the WHO does not currently recommend corticosteroids in other viral diseases, like Dengue as the 'glucocorticoid-mediated stimulation of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis can also drive lymphocytopenia, or it may promote exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses that eventually cause a worsening of the pathogenic condition'. These are unprecedented times for the medical community and although evidence suggests a potential role for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in COVID-19 treatment, caution should be exercised until further evidence, specific to this infection strain, emerges.

COVID-19 is a self-limiting disease in more than 80% of patients. Severe pneumonia occurred in about 15% of cases as revealed in studies with large cohorts of patients. The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon Î±2b, interferon Î², chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon Î±2b and interferon Î² are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",40.83855887639169,15.332089255483698

Several important clinical features of COVID-19 have also been documented in this study. First, an attack rate of 83% within the family context is alarmingly high, indicating the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Second, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in this family range from mild to moderate, with more systematic symptoms and more severe radiological abnormalities seen in older patients. Generally, COVID-19 appears to be less severe than SARS. Third, an asymptomatic child was found to have ground-glass opacities in his lung and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in his sputum sample. This finding of asymptomatic virus shedding raises the possibility for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic carriers to others, which is later confirmed by others [2] .

In vitro studies using cell culture assays have shown that coronavirus infection commonly results in cytopathic effects such as cellular lysis or apoptosis [61] . Also, the virus can cause cellular fusion leading to the formation of syncytia. These cytopathic effects are caused by steps of the viral replica-tion such as the mobilisation of vesicles to form the viral replication complex [18] , leading to the disruption of Golgi complexes [62] . Parallel to results on other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV has been shown to cause cytopathic effects in Vero cells and the formation of syncytia in lung tissues. A further similarity with other coronaviruses seems to be the potential of the SARS-CoV to cause tissue fibrosis [63] .

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",37.779706797283126,15.192909078248771

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection.

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",26.023402019431877,8.758869079184274

The newborn and the mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be isolated in different rooms and be screened very carefully (4, 7, 21, 23) .

Generally, our review of literature showed that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and their newborns had less problems than would be anticipated for those with SARS-CoV-1 infection.

Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [7] .

The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] .

For example, Belardo et al. have demonstrated, in cell culture-based assays using different human and avian models, that the combination of NA inhibitors and nitazoxanide presents synergistic anti-influenza effects (117) . Convincing results were also obtained using a combination treatment including naproxen. In a clinical trial enrolling hospitalized patients infected by influenza A(H3N2), combination therapy with naproxen, oseltamivir, and clarithromycin showed improved efficacy in terms of hospital stay duration and patient mortality, when compared to oseltamivir treatment alone (118) . In the context of the evaluation of the antiviral activity of diltiazem in the reconstituted human airway epithelium model MucilAir TM , our group demonstrated that the diltiazem-oseltamivir combination treatment conferred a greater reduction of apical viral titers than that was measured with the same-dose monotherapy, with a marked delay of viral production (98) .

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3Â± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test.

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃÅ® 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",29.867696453362164,10.551831705103625

This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available. However, at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected, to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years, too. There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months. Some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in Italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels, and those above expected levels will then be attributed to COVID-19.",26.92161049934028,10.22834838601082

By the end of February 2020, it was already clear in the case of COVID-19 that it would be successfully suppressed in its primary focal point -Wuhan. It was also already stopped using the first line of defence in another thirty Chinese provinces and surrounding countries in Asia. Then, on the 28 th of February, the first estimates of death rates were published, suggesting that it was a disease with a death rate significantly lower than that of SARS and MERS [3, 4] .

It should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that, with more data, R0 for COVID-19 would start converging more towards 1.4.

Considering the current public health crisis, we considered the potential molecular interactions between COVID-19 spike protein and human CD26, with an interest to explore the structural differences or similarities between SARS-CoV and COVID-19 spike protein interactions. To this end, a computational model based selective docking was performed using the server Cluspro protein-protein docking (Www.cluspro.bu.edu) and Frodock (http://frodock.chaconlab. org/) for further validation using our modelled 3D homotrimer structure of COVID-19 Spike glycoprotein ( Figure 2 ) and the human CD26 (PDB: 4QZV) [10] .

The built glycosylation shield structures of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins were superimposed and are shown in Figure 1(C) . As shown in Figure 1 (C) and Table S1 , there are a number of conserved glycosylation sites between these two viral strains, however there are also several unique glycosylation sites in COVID-19 compared to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein.

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) .

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",31.541820393173268,10.007316554208465

It took time for the medical professionals to learn about the virus and the disease in order to make correct diagnosis. Secondly, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires two independent confirmatory laboratory tests, which should be taken at least 1 day apart. Our results showed that the lag correlation is shorter for the suspected than for laboratory-confirmed cases.

Due to the large number of critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients, AngII has been made available in Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom for compassionate use because, despite approval by the European Medicines Agency, it is not yet commercially available in Europe. Perhaps we will learn some important lessons from these patients, so as to inform our efforts going forward. For instance, should AngII be used for all COVID-19 patients in shock? Should it be considered earlier in the course of disease, perhaps as a first-line vasopressor? Finally, and more controversially, should we evaluate the modulating effects of AngII on ACE2 for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients without shock? AngII use has been described at sub-pressor doses, and multiple studies have shown that higher levels of MAP may not be harmful. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolves, we must consider any form of therapy that may ""flatten"" the curve (https://www.flattenthecurve.com).

A specific reference was made to data from South Korea where 30% of the 2,000 tested patients reported symptoms or anosmia or ageusia. The article states that doctors are advising patients to self-isolate if they experience these symptoms as it could be an early indication of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. This is particularly pertinent since current governmental guidelines in the United Kingdom (UK) state that if you have either a temperature or a dry cough then to self-isolate. Should anosmia emerge as a symptom of COVID-19, this could encourage more people to self-isolate, even in absence of other symptoms, to prevent further spread of the virus. Therefore, more information surrounding this possible symptom is crucial. However, whilst it is possible that anosmia and ageusia are in fact symptoms of COVID-19, to our knowledge there is currently no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia and/or ageusia/dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients.

Hassan et al. reported that influenza A viral replication activated the IRE1 branch of UPR [23] . The IRE1Î± pathway is also activated during a murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection [24] . Another study observed that hepatitis C virus suppressed the IRE1Î±-XBP1 pathway during infection [25] . Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a betaherpes virus, which can also inhibit the XBP1 target gene EDEM (ER degradation enhancing Î±-mannosidase-like protein) to benefit viral replication [26] . The investigation of cellular UPR during HSV-1 replication has been mainly focused on the PERK signaling pathway [13, 27, 28] . Although studies have shown that RNase activity of IRE1Î± was inactivated during HSV-1 infection [29, 30] , it remains unknown about the effect of IRE1Î± RNase activity on viral replication. Stress-induced JNKs activation was reported to be important for the efficiency of HSV-1 viral replication since JNK inhibitors could reduce the viral yield by 70% [31, 32] . Since activated IRE1Î± can lead to JNKs activation [22] , the relationship between JNKs and IRE1Î± during viral infection deserves further investigation. In the current study, we found that the IRE1Î± expression was up-regulated during HSV-1 infection, which suggests that the IRE1Î± branch may be involved in the regulation of HSV-1 replication. Further study showed that when IRE1Î± RNase activity was increased by either pretreating cells with chemical compounds or XBP1s over-expression, the HSV-1 replication was repressed, suggesting that the RNase activity of IRE1Î± is unfavorable for the virus. We presented evidence that the JNK is activated by IRE1Î± kinase activity, and thus facilitates viral replication. In conclusion, our research indicates that HSV-1 replication is regulated by both the RNase and the kinase activities of IRE1Î±, and these two activities have distinct effects on viral replication.",28.283844530383867,9.967705202033164

Moreover, the results are fairly consistent, regardless of the used model, virus strains, or method of Treg manipulation. However, adverse effects on viral load have been observed in the TMEV model. Here, a suppression of antiviral immunity occurred in the acute disease phase, characterized by high virus replication, whereas no effects are observed in chronic, low-level viral replication. Moreover, the effects were only observed in animals of a certain genetic background, which are highly prone to virus persistence by nature. TMEV infection has been performed in inbred mice with other genetic backgrounds (e.g., Balb/c, C3H, DBA/1, 129), and also recently in collaborative cross mice, resulting in a broad range of disease phenotypes and susceptibility to virus persistence [143, 163] . However, the studies did not investigate the impact of Treg manipulation on infection outcome. In the coronavirus model, Treg manipulation did not affect virus control in the CNS.

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data.

Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted.

Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty.

By comparison, the effects of viral infection on the respiratory microbiome appear to be relatively modest, but detectable. While the effects of these alterations on risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia have not been studied, potential mechanisms by which these changes might modulate susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections include alterations in the nature and magnitude of the immune response in the host (microbiome on host effects) and facilitating growth of pathogens in the absence of normal commensals (inter-microbial effects). In this article, we review the current understanding of how alterations in the microbiome following viral infection might alter host immune responses and increase susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.

To clarify the relationship of NOP53 redistribution with viral replication, DNA polymerase inhibitor PMEG 42 was used for nuclear and cytoplasmic separation analysis.

Such an event is common enough in the viral world, particularly among positive-stranded RNA viruses, and may in principle be achieved either in cis (the proteinase domain cleaves the polypeptide of which it is a part) or in trans (it cleaves another polyprotein molecule). Our structure precludes the possibility of the C-terminus of PRO looping back towards the entry to the catalytic cleft in the same molecule. Therefore, cleavage of the TYMV replication polyprotein at the PRO/HEL junction occurs only in trans. This cleavage is a regulatory event in the replication of the TYMV RNA genome. It occurs in the replication complex comprising the two products of the first cleavage: the 66K RdRp and the 140K protein. 140K harbors PRO and localization determinants to the chloroplast envelope, where it recruits 66K. There, cleavage of 140K at the PRO/ HEL junction into 98K and the 42K helicase contributes to the switch to synthesis of the +strand [7] [8] (Fig. S1 in Text S1). A strictly trans cleavage likely takes part in the regulation by requiring a sufficient local concentration of 140K at the chloroplast membrane and/or remodeling of this membrane into a special compartment for viral replication before synthesis of new viral genomes.

That these signatures of adaptive evolution might reflect genetic conflicts with multiple inhibitors is consistent with the fact that OAS1 and cGAS detect multiple pathogens [15, 32, 33, 35, 38, 65] .

Structural analysis shows that COVID-19 probably derives from a bat SARS-like coronavirus, which has mutated in the spike glycoprotein (protein S) and nucleocapsid N protein The positive-sense RNA genomes of COVID-19 is differ from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV approximately 29.9 kb, 27.9 kb and 30.1 kb, respectively [6] . The COVID-19 complete genome was annotated to possess 14 open reading frames ORFs encode 27 proteins. Sequence analysis revealed that COVID-19 is identity 80% more than to SARS-CoV and 50% to the MERS-CoV which originated in bat [7, 8] . In addition to that, spherical external spike protein displays a characteristic crown shape can be observed under an electron microscope [9] . Current study, we have compared between novel COVID-19 complete genome with other related corona virus to provoke the mutation and the gaps. We selected the data from NCBI and we did the FASTA and BLAST. The comparison between genomes with alignment has done using MAAFT-7 software. COVID-19 gene bank (MT188341.1), COVID-19 (MT066175.1), bat-SL-CoVZC45 (MG772933.1), SARS-CoV BJ182b (EU371561.1) are identical alignment in 99%, 89%, and 82% respectively. In figure (1) shows the differences between 4 complete genomes shows as follow: Upon to the result above, we revealed that all COVID-19 strains are closest similarity compared to other strains related to the same family. In other words, we believe that COVID-19 came from several mutations happened to other members of coronavirus relates to the same infection. Although genomic analysis does not support the belief that COVID-19 is a laboratory construct, currently it is impossible to disprove or prove the theories of its origin. To identify the COVID-19 origin, obtaining virus sequences from immediate animal sources would be the most definite method. The first ORF (ORF1a/b) translates two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP) which takes two-thirds of viral RNA. The remaining ORFs encode structural proteins including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein.

Our approach entails utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-expressing, non-replicating cells as carriers and presenters of immunogenic antigens, so called ""Icells"". By using irradiated cells as presenting vehicles of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens(s) in a cellular context, these presented viral proteins can be recognized by the host immune system, thus, an efficient protective immune response might be elicited. Another advantage of this strategy is that the manufacturing process is scalable and yields uniform cell products allowing for ""off-the-shelf"" frozen supply availability. To prevent engraftment and proliferation of the cells after administration, the cells will be irradiated post-harvesting abolishing in vivo replication potential. Specifically, immunoreactive Spike-1 proteins from SARS-CoV-2 are expressed on the surface of irradiated target Icells. Utilizing this innovative strategy, these viral antigen-displaying decoy cells will be developed as a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 disease.

Reporter virus assays and reporter cell assays are similar in approach but different in design. In a reporter virus assay, a reporter gene is inserted into a nonessential region of a viral genome, leading to expression of the corresponding reporter protein when the virus replicates inside cells. When using a reporter cell assay, a reporter gene is inserted into the target cell and activated upon viral infection. As such, inhibitors of viral replication decrease reporter-protein expression and thus the activity of the reporter protein. This loss-of-signal endpoint can yield a potentially high number of false-positive hits, deriving from molecules that interfere with the activity of the reporter protein and from molecules that adversely affect the health of the target cell and thus its ability to host robust replication of the virus. For this reason, a cytotoxicity assay, when performed in parallel with the primary screen, can assist the discovery of viral-specific inhibitors as first demonstrated in the discovery of inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (6, 7) and in a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of the measles virus (8) . While reporter-based assays utilize live virus and, thus, offer advantages presented by the above-described cytopathic viral assays, the loss-of-signal endpoint of reporter virus/cell assays illustrates the need for robust counter screens to rapidly identify genuine anti-viral lead compounds.",24.746860500229246,9.043247073261437

Interestingly, a growing number of individuals with no travel history to China and no direct contact with infected patients have become infected (Lim et al., 2020) . To understand how this virus rapidly spreads within a community, and to inform infection control messaging, it is essential to develop an experimental animal model that can support the active infection, shedding, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to sentinel animals. In this study, we established an infection and transmission ferret animal model for COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 was found to efficiently infect ferrets and induce moderate increases in body temperature ($38.5-40.3 C) . Moreover, we were able to detect viral RNA in blood (for 4 dpi), nasal washes (for 8 dpi), urine (for 8 dpi), and fecal (for 8 dpi) specimens.

The economic fall-out from COVID-19 appears to be profound, at least $20 trillion in a few short weeks, and may exceed the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The direct costs of COVID-19 travel bans, social distancing, and other responses are merely one aspect. Far more devastating is the uncertainty that has gripped capital markets. Declining economic activity and large drops in capital markets have a mutually reinforcing impact, undermining the capacity of heavily indebted businesses and households to cover their debts. Uncertainty is the primary driver of such crises, and stems in large measure from lack of close coordination and science-based decision-making. Were there more certainty, households, investors and other economic agents would be less inclined to panic. COVID-19 appears certain to become a very costly lesson that DRR does indeed save many more multiples in avoided costs than its initial investment. An additional point in this regard is that health is a critical infrastructure. The resilience of critical infrastructure is well identified in DRR literature (e.g. [18, 19] ). Resilience is fostered not just by sciencebased decisions and coordination, but also via redundancy to ensure buffer capacity when a particular system collapses [20] . Disaster-illiterate economic policy tends to see redundancy as inefficiency. But in order to cope with COVID-19 and alleviate -if not prevent -future emergencies, supply chains for at least some critical items need to be more local. In tandem, governments and private businesses will have to broaden their crisis planning to ensure timely availability of items essential to limiting pandemic risks.",25.20299401254416,7.650605364191891

The N95 respirator is designed with filtration requirements to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and minimize leakage from the facial seal. 14 As such, it protects the wearer from the inhalation of viral particles. Surgical masks are often fitted loosely but can prevent respiratory droplet transmission and prevent hand-to-face contact. They are considered to be more effective in preventing spread from an infected person wearing the mask to another than in protecting the wearer from infection.

Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3",34.6749514878061,13.776428110310762

In order for the virus to complete entry into the cell following this initial process, the spike protein has to be primed by an enzyme called a protease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) uses a protease called TMPRSS2 to complete this process. 10, 11 In order to attach virus receptor (spike protein) to its cellular ligand (ACE2), activation by TMPRSS2 as a protease is needed (Fig. 4) . 10 After the virus enters the host cell and uncoats, the genome is transcribed and then translated. Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicate, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene. 12 The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins. Besides RNAdependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3 0 -to-5 0 exoribonuclease, 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1 0 -phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic Genotype and phenotype of COVID- 19 3 phosphodiesterase activities. 13, 14 The proteins are assembled at the cell membrane and genomic RNA is incorporated as the mature particle forms by budding from the internal cell membranes. 15",32.66147885778214,12.921985062167376

Given successive single positive nucleocapsid gene on day9 and day 10, we hypothesize that this fluorescent quantitative PCR kit is more sensitive to amplify nucleocapsid gene than orf1ab gene, samples with low viral load might result in single positive nucleocapsid gene. From Fig. 1 , Ct value of nucleocapsid gene on day 10 (31.54) was less than it on day 9 (32.84), which showed a trend toward increasing levels of virus. On day 16, two positive target genes (orf1ab and nucleocapsid) were tested along with higher viral load. If we comply with the pending criterion of single positive gene in old edition guidelines, diagnosis of a COVID-19 patient with low viral load will be delayed or even missed.

According to the theory of TCM, the target organ location of COVID-19 is the lung, and the etiology attribute is ""damp and toxin plague"". The network pharmacology analysis showed that QPD has an overall regulatory effect via multi-component and multi-target. The primary site of pharmacological action is the lung, as 16 herbs to lung meridian, which indicated that the decoction is mainly specific for lung diseases. In addition, it can play the role of dehumidification through the rise and fall of the spleen and stomach, and exhibited the protection for heart, kidney and other organs. Among the potential targets screen, most of them co-expressed with ACE-2, the receptor of COVID-19, indicating the potential improvement of COVID-19. It can inhibit the replication of COVID-19 by acting on multiple ribosomal proteins. COVID-19 can lead to strong immune response and inflammatory storm [4] . Functional enrichment analysis showed that QPD could inhibit and alleviate excessive immune response and eliminate inflammation by regulating immune related pathway and cytokine action related pathway [5] .

This inhibition was observed using two Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol. Silencing of Hsp90 expression using siRNA also reduced viral replication. Hsp90 inhibition changed the half-life of newly synthesized L protein (the large subunit of the VSV polymerase) from >1 hour to less than 15 minutes without affecting the stability of other VSV proteins. Both the inhibition of viral replication and the destabilization of the viral L protein were seen when either geldanamycin or radicicol was added to cells infected with paramyxoviruses SV5, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, or SV41, or to cells infected with the La Crosse bunyavirus.

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members.

At present, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccine against COVID-19 infection for potential therapy of humans. The only option available is using broad-spectrum antiviral drugs like Nucleoside analogues and also HIV-protease inhibitors that could attenuate virus infection until the specific antiviral becomes available [7] . The treatment that have so far been attempted showed that 75 patients were administrated existing antiviral drugs. The course of treatment included twice a day oral administration of 75 mg oseltamivir, 500 mg lopinavir, 500 mg ritonavir and the intravenous administration of 0Â·25 g ganciclovir for 3-14 days [26] .

One 7 day course regimen for adults is 2 g of niclosamide on day 1 followed by 1 g daily for 6 days. 10,55 When treating human volunteers each with a single oral dose of 2000 mg of niclosamide, the maximum serum concentration of niclosamide was equivalent to 0.25â 6.0 Î¼g/mL (0.76â18.3 Î¼M). The wide concentration range was caused by the intraindividual absorption differences. Niclosamide is only partially absorbed from the intestinal tract, and the absorbed part is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys with no cumulative toxic effects in human. 10 Through a series of drug repurposing screening campaigns, niclosamide was found to be effective against a variety of human conditions such as cancer and viral infections. Currently, there are four ongoing human clinical trials of niclosamide in ulcerative colitis, prostate carcinoma, and colorectal cancer in the ClinicalTrails.gov clinical trials registry. 56 Of note, niclosamide has several weaknesses such as unneglectable cytotoxicity and limited aqueous solubility as well as relatively low absorption and oral bioavailability (F = 10%), which may hamper its extensive clinical development as an antiviral agent. 57 Our group has made substantial efforts in medicinal chemistry based on niclosamide as a lead compound and discovered a series of O-alkylamino-tethered derivatives as potent and orally bioavailable anticancer agents with improved aqueous solubility 16 and diversified salicylamide derivatives as potent anti-HAdV inhibitors with increased potency (submicromolar IC 50 s) and significantly decreased cytotoxicity likely by targeting different steps in the HAdV life cycle. 58 The ester derivative prodrug of niclosamide was also reported to increase its systemic drug exposure and extend the duration of exposure. 59 The development of nanobased formulations is another useful strategy for improving the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of niclosamide and maximizing its therapeutic potential for clinical applications. 60â62 The outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared to be a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO, and the development of effective therapies for fast-spreading fatal COVID-19 is in an urgent need. 3CL protease is a key enzyme that is responsible for proteolytic processing and is indispensable for viral replication and the infection process. 6 3CL protease has been solved by Zihe Rao and Haitao Yang (PDB ID: 6LU7, Figure 2) , and this may significantly facilitate the discovery of potent small-molecule inhibitors of COVID-19 by targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease via highthroughput virtual screening of compound libraries or existing drug libraries for drug repurposing. In addition, Wrapp et al. have determined a cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein trimer in the prefusion conformation that will also facilitate vaccine development and the discovery of antiviral therapeutics for COVID-19. 63 Although these crystal structures may provide new insights and helpful information for future drug discovery, extensive efforts are needed to identify effective binding pockets for small molecules and validate the drug targets.",29.411390896847536,12.149292133921128

We envision that once its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is validated in animal models or human clinical trials, niclosamide and its optimized analogues may be developed as effective antiviral therapeutics with the potential to benefit numerous infected patients in this outbreak of COVID-19.

Such treatment trapped viruses in the endosomes and dense lysosomes, but did not affect initial endocytosis [5] . In contrast, proteasomal inhibitors blocked endocytosis of influenza virus due to the blockade of ubiquitination of epsin 1, a cargo specific adaptor for clathrin [6] .

Thus, several unrelated viral families depend on the UPS system even before the onset of viral replication.

The national expert group has recommended lopinavir and ritonavir as effective anti-COVID-19 agents in China, and most clinical trials on COVID-19 select both drugs as positive controls. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Currently, only one trial combines emtricitabine/tenofoviralafenamide and lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19 patients. Arbidol as a 2â²-5â²oligoadenylates synthesis (OAS) inhibitor against severe pneumonia and virusassociated cytokine dysregulation has displayed anti-COVID-19 potential in clinical trials [4] . However, the mechanism needs to be clarified in the near future. Chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have elicited antiviral effects on several viruses such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E by interfering with endosomal acidification. Based on the advantage of known broadspectrum activity and rarely occurring adverse reactions, a series of clinical trials on chloroquine and its derivatives have been advancing rapidly. Presently, Chinese government authorities have approved chloroquine phosphate to be used to treat adult patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Further, treatments combining Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and chemical molecules (popularly known as Western medicine in China) have shown some exciting results. In view of inconclusive clinical evidence on TCM efficacy, pharmacologists should separate active pharmaceutical ingredients and identify explicit targets as soon as possible [5] . Surprisingly, various drugs are also in clinical trials despite the lack of biological rationale, such as the antiinfluenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir targeting neuraminidase, baloxavirmarboxil targeting cap-dependent endonuclease that is not found in COVID-19, ASC09 targeting protease with no anti-coronavirus research reported, and cobicistat targeting CYP3A4 with only unpersuasive predicted activity by computer virtual docking. As the crystal structures of COVID-19 spike [6] , dimeric full-length human ACE2 [7] and COVID-19 spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ACE2 receptor [8] are published in succession, the lead drug discovery strategy such as structure-based HTS and molecular dynamics simulation to discover inhibitors with affinity to ACE2, the S protein or the protein-protein interaction will be possible in the near future. There have been three major outbreaks of coronaviruses in the 21st century: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19. Drawing experience from effective screening strategies on antitumor drug development, the credible and large-scale screening system of the especially deadly coronaviruses must be set up at the molecular level and in animal models as soon as possible. Although the clinical safety of old drugs has been proven, some of them can cause serious adverse reactions. For example, hydroxychloroquine has the side effect of arrhythmia, which can itself lead to death. Thus, special attention needs to be paid to the safety of old drugs in new indications.",39.47521261312804,16.468229987009213

COVID-19, a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified, is similar to the coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV with >79% sequence identity; but it is more distant from MERS-CoV (only 50% homology) [2] . For all coronaviruses including COVID-19, at least three structural proteins are shared on the membrane: spike (S), the membrane protein (M) and small membrane protein (E). Also, another four functional proteins were found in almost all coronaviruses: 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase. During the viral infection process, including intracellular transport of virions, proliferation and assembling of virions in the infected cellnot only structural and functional proteins but also some proteasesplay a key part, suggesting that targeting these proteins or enzymes as a therapy against COVID-19 infection could be a promising strategy. To date, no special drugs or vaccines have been used to deal with human coronaviruses. Considering the seriousness and suddenness of the COVID-19 outbreak, ~200 clinical trials on COVID-19 have commenced in China, and it is promising to report that certain targets and their agents have displayed strong antiviral potential, of which some have been permitted to be used in an attempt to combat the disease in clinical trials.",36.493229342495376,12.68261594032073

Subsequent budding of the viral particles from the capillary endothelium and damage to the endothelial lining can favor viral access to the brain ( Figure  1B) .

Most of the evidence of ACE2 expression in the brain ( Figure 1 ) comes from literature and mammalian tissue expression databases, 2 which prompted us to investigate neurotropic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its contribution toward the morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. 3.1. Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Recently, a study posted in medRxiv 4 has reported neurological manifestations in COVID-19 in the current outbreak that involved 214 patients, of which 78 (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations, which affirms our rationale of the neurotropic potential in the COVID-19 virus.

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.

Nevertheless, based on the assumption that viral RNA load correlates with high levels of viral replication, 5 there are important insights to be gained from this time-course analysis. Currently, our understanding of the relationship between viral RNA load kinetics and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 remains fragmented. Zou and colleagues reported that patients with COVID-19 with more severe disease requiring intensive care unit admission had high viral RNA loads at 10 days and beyond, after symptom onset. 4 Unfortunately, it is unknown when in the course of their disease these patients deteriorated. By contrast, Lescure and colleagues report the viral RNA kinetics of two patients who developed late respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. It would be interesting to know whether viral RNA load in lung tissue, or a surrogate sample such as tracheal aspirate, mirrors the decline in nasopharyngeal shedding. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that these late, severe manifestations might be immunologically mediated and has obvious implications for the potential to use immune-modulatory therapies for this subset of patients. This finding is consistent with recent reports that corticosteroids were beneficial for acute respiratory distress syndrome, 6 and possibly those with COVID-19. 7 With more detailed data such as those provided by Lescure and colleagues, the use of viral RNA load to suggest potential clinical strategies to treat COVID-19 could be exploited.",37.81885197917076,13.084672247427783

It is also possibly confounded by the hemodynamic alterations associated with critical illness, such as hypotension, which stimulates the RAS. At present, the interpretation of any clinical observations regarding the RAS in patients with COVID-19 are difficult to interpret in the context of sepsis, viral infection, and pharmacologic effects of treatment.

Konig et al. and Karlas et al. 49, 52 share the highest number of matching host factors, perhaps because both of these studies used the same epithelial cell line and virus strain in their experiments. The other studies use different viruses (i.e. A â PR8 or VSV-G enveloped virus) and different cell lines (e.g. HBEC, Drosophila cell line). The source of the RNAi libraries may also be a contributing factor to the observed variation. However, when analyses are carried out at the pathway or complex level rather than the gene level, more common pathways can be identified across the published studies for influenza. These include pathways involved in ion transport; nuclear pore function; interferon-related and kinase signalling. In addition, analyses were extended to identify host pathways shared between influenza and other RNA viruses (e.g. HIV, HCV). Many common cellular pathways and complexes were found, for example, certain shared kinase signalling complexes are necessary for influenza, HIV, HCV and WNV replication. 49 Finally, host factor-directed inhibitors of influenza replication were tested. For example, CAMK2B is a host cell kinase involved in cytoskeletal regulation and CREB-dependent transcription. CAMK2B was found to be needed for optimal influenza virus polymerase activity and postulated to be involved in viral RNA transcription. Using the CAMK2B inhibitor, KN-93, viral replication was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Diphyllin that inhibits vATPases (several members of which were identified in the screen) was also effective in reducing viral replication. Both of these inhibitors warrant further study in animal models of influenza. Other studies have shown that host factor-directed inhibitors like targeting the Raf â MEK â ERK kinase pathway and the activation of NF-jB 53-55 lead to decreased viral replication.",25.05908538266393,10.69852468845775

At this time, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) has recommended continuing to treat with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, unless specifically advised otherwise by the individual's medical team. It is very important to keep on top of updates from the FDA or WHO, as their recommendations are susceptible to modification as new evidence becomes available. 12 Data in support of the efficacy and safety of these drugs is, in most cases, circumstantial and weak. Using drugs with unproven benefits may represent experimental use. Intentional research using such agents should be approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent needs to be applied. Clinical pharmacists can play a significant role in getting individuals enrolled in such ongoing studies.",28.3766417252395,11.493437421478898

To limit the virus spread, those in the USA are canceling both smaller (â¼100 people) and large meetings, researchers are limiting their travel both overseas and within the country, and student college and graduate school visit weekends are being postponed or stopped altogether. Still, there is much uncertainty about how to proceed and what other measures should be taken. Since the outbreak began in China, Chinese scientists have already faced many of the questions that those of us in other locations are now asking. We therefore asked several Chinese scientists to discuss the strategies that they are pursuing to limit the impact of the virus both on their research and on society. Some of the actions taken by the scientists and the government under this extreme situation may have a long-term influence and shift our future research and funding paradigm. We anticipate that their perspectives will be valuable to the community. global lifethreatening concern in recent days. The war against COVID-19 there has now reached the most critical moment, as confirmed COVID-19 cases have peaked for several days, and almost all the people in Wuhan City have been screened for suspected case identification (as of late February). We cannot imagine how people there are sacrificing to control the spread of COVID-19. As alumni of Wuhan University that is located in the center of Wuhan city, we became deeply saddened and worried as we watched the entire city cope with an unprecedented emergency situation. We wanted to provide a glimpse of what chemical biologists have been working on, from the perspective of scientists in China. In the past 40 days, we have heard more stories of hope and resilience than of worry and grief in China, where 1.4 billion people are doing their best to bring this serious outbreak under control. Right now, the epidemic situation outside Hubei is gradually improving, and the situation inside Hubei has shown signs of stabilization. It is noteworthy that although it is mandated that most people have to stay at home as a quarantine procedure, scientists in China have been increasingly devoted to combating COVID-19, with several clinical trials currently underway. As for scientists throughout the world, researchers in China are making extraordinary efforts toward rapid advancement of diagnostic and treatment approaches, and are doing so under highly challenging personal circumstances with extensive restrictions on not only travel, but day-to-day activities. As mentioned by WHO officers, Chinese scientists have been extremely professional in the face of this epidemic and have made their findings rapidly available to researchers around the world to coordinate global efforts to characterize, treat, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. One team led by Yongzhen Zhang from Fudan University completed the deep sequencing of COVID-19 and made its whole genome sequence publicly available on January 10, 2020. 1 Medical experts, virologists, structural biologists, and medicinal chemists have made significant contributions in areas such as epidemic prevention and control, patient treatment, virus classification and traceability, structure analysis, and clinical drug development. The current progress relied on the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the dedication of scientific researchers. During the epidemic, almost all industries not related to any antiepidemic efforts were halted due to the lock down of transportation and lack of manpower.

However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14] . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides [15] . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients [16] . 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes [17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 [18, 19] . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence [20] . Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.",29.95770374647305,11.629078952461818

General measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection will be of utmost importance for these patients. Depending on the local infrastructure, implementation of COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals is warranted. However, based on the local COVID-19-burden, a sharp separation of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" wards/hospitals may not be sustainable, although recent evidence provides somewhat reassuring data regarding the absence of environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA of inanimate surfaces outside patient rooms. 20 Wherever possible, patients with chronic liver disease requiring inpatient care for non-COVID-19 causes should be admitted to COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals. As these institutions may not be able to provide specialised hepatology-care, similar to our recommendations on outpatient care, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information to facilitate immediate hepatology consultations. However, due to the contagiousness of the virus, patients with underlying liver disease will become infected and will subsequently require inpatient care for COVID-19. With regards to nosocomial-infections, recent observations from Spain that compared patient characteristics between patients with community-acquired influenza and nosocomial-acquired influenza could not detect a significant difference between these cohorts with regards to underlying chronic liver disease. 21 Whether these observations will also hold up in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be proven.

At the national and international level, travel restrictions have been implemented for regions with the highest COVID-19 incidence currently, but these recommendations and polices are likely to rapidly change and warrant close monitoring. Patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 with recent travel to areas of higher incidence (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy based on the most recent CDC data) should be asked to wear a standard surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be placed in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne isolation room (negative-pressure room). 3, 7 It is important to note that travel history criteria for testing for COVID-19 will change as community-based spread is emerging within the United States and patients living in or with recent travel to areas where COVID-19 has been confirmed should be considered for testing as well. Any concern for possible COVID-19 should immediately prompt notification of institutional infection prevention and control as well as local or state health departments. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions (gown and gloves), airborne precautions (with N95 respirator), and eye protection (goggles or a face shield). Testing has been performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but is now more widely available in state and city laboratories and is becoming available commercially. It is important that more common respiratory illnesses (influenza, etc.) are also ruled out. What should we tell our patients based on our current knowledge? First, this is a rapidly evolving area with new information emerging on a daily basis. Therefore periodically checking on recommendations from leading national and international health organizations, such as the CDC or the World Health Organization (WHO), is the most important way for both patients and physicians to stay informed with accurate information. Second, it is important to realize that the majority of cases (80+%) have been mild, the fatality rate for COVID-19 is lower than prior coronavirus outbreaks, and the proportion of severe/fatal cases may be an overestimate as milder or asymptomatic cases are likely under-reported. 15 Third, there are currently no specific recommendations for people on immunosuppression, such as IBD patients. Prior IBD research has found that viral infections are more likely among patients on immunomodulators (such as 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine) than those on biologics but it is unclear if this can be extended to COVID-19. 16 There are no data currently about the impact of immunosuppressive agents, although one of the largest case series from China did note that 2 patients with immunodeficiency (not further specified) had non-severe disease. 8 17 Last, the best measures to decrease the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 are the same as standard practices against any viral illness. These include good hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizers or soap and water, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing, limiting touching your face, avoiding close contact with anyone with influenza-like and/or upper respiratory symptoms, and staying home if you are sick.",27.448287037484256,11.429027811304074

First, mis-incorporation of foreign nucleotides in replicating viral genomes may cause chain termination and disrupt subsequent replication or transcription. Chain termination may be immediate (obligate) or may occur following a limited extent of continued RNA or DNA synthesis (non-obligate). Second, NIs may incorporate into elongating nucleotide chains, mispairing with and/or substituting natural nucleotides, thereby introducing mutations that potentially impair RNA synthesis, structure, or RNA-protein interactions or protein functions. Accumulation of mutations and loss of virus viability are referred to as lethal mutagenesis and error catastrophe [14] . Through these mechanisms, NIs alter the genetic makeup of the virus, leading to a decrease in viral fitness with every consecutive replication cycle. Finally, NIs may cause depletion of pools of naturally occurring nucleotides by mimicking [15] .",30.896577154768472,11.941829839657284

First, collectively, Africa needs a unified continent-wide strategy for preparedness and response. The strategy must be comprehensive, and member states, donors, and partners should immediately commit to releasing financial resources to support country-customised implementation plans derived from the strategy. To help develop a common strategy that will allow for effective coordination, collaboration, and communication, the African Union Commission, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and WHO, in partnership with African countries, have established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR). The partnership has six work streams: laboratory diagnosis and subtyping; surveillance, including screening at points of entry and cross-border activities; infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities; clinical management of people with severe COVID-19; risk communication; and supply-chain management and stockpiles. Because mitigating the potential spread of COVID-19 in Africa will require rapid detection and containment, the laboratory work streams of AFTCOR, Africa CDC, and WHO are working closely to expeditiously scale up diagnostic testing capacity linked to enhanced surveillance and monitoring-eg, at the beginning of February, only two countries in Africa had the diagnostic capacity to test for COVID-19. However, as of Feb 25, 2020, more than 40 countries would have been capacitated to accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection, thanks to the coordination efforts of AFTCOR. 6 As testing becomes more available, it is possible that more cases might be detected. Second, any effective preparedness and response strategy for COVID-19 requires a committed political will; as such, the African Union Commission, Africa CDC, and WHO convened, on Feb 22, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an emergency meeting of all ministers of health of 55 member states to commit to acting fast and collectively to develop and implement a coordinated continent-wide strategy. AFTCOR taskforce was formed, and a continent-wide strategy was endorsed at the end of the emergency meeting, with a call for strong coordination of efforts. To prevent the occurrence of a social, health security, and economic tragedy, actions agreed at the emergency ministerial meeting will need to be acted on quickly, before any additional COVID-19 cases are introduced to the continent, and result in sustained human-tohuman transmission. The potential social, economic, and security devastation that COVID-19 could cause in Africa should be enough of an incentive for African governments to invest immediately in preparedness for the worst-case scenario. Third, commitment and release of financial resources from partners and donors before a crisis hits Africa will help anticipate demand and address supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs, such as large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents. Supplies of these items will be limited in Africa because of reduced manufacturing capacity.",28.65789593119965,11.772760459789048

As demonstrated in this report, the development of mild COVID-19 illness was insidiously initiated and persisted for a long period. The prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 detection in naso-oropharyngeal specimens of the COVID-19 patients with mild illness is of concern in epidemic areas. Clinical manifestations of viral respiratory infections range from asymptomatic or flu-like symptoms such as fever, nonproductive or productive cough, myalgia, rhinorrhea, and sore throat, to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organs failure. 10 Various viral pathogens cause community-acquired infections during the cold season in Taiwan.

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1Â·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1Â·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19.

Some of these agents are in phase III trials for COVID-19, including remdesivir, oseltamivir, ASC09F (HIV protease inhibitor), lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and cobicistat. 71 Many existing MERS-and/or SARS-CoVs inhibitors can be screened for efficacy. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has shown 96% identity to that of SARS-CoV, a critical finding since drugs developed for SARS-CoV RdRp might show similar efficacy for SARS-CoV -2 RdRp. 28 S protein is considered the major target for designing CoV antiviral therapies such as S protein inhibitors, S cleavage inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, RBD-ACE2 blockers, siRNAs, fusion core blockers, and protease inhibitors. 19 All such therapeutic strategies have shown potential in vitro and/ or in vivo anti-CoV activities. Comparatively, even though in vitro studies performed with these agents have shown efficacy, most of them lack sufficient support due to the lack of randomized animal or human trials, hence of limited use for COVID-19. Hence, the necessary support of extensive animal and human trials is required for such therapeutics to become useful. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 affects the balance of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), potentially leading to exacerbation of severe pneumonia. Thus, it is speculated that ACEI and angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) inhibitors might be able to reduce pulmonary inflammatory responses, thereby reducing the mortality. 72 The guidance to COVID-19 control might be based on existing measures for MERS and SARS, with some further precautions due to the unknown nature of this new CoV. 14, 73 The main treatments such as mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe cases. Furthermore, RNA synthesis inhibitors (like 3TC, TDF), remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, Chinese traditional medicine, such as Lianhuaqingwen and ShuFengJieDu Capsules, could be the promising COVID-19 treatments. 2 However, further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for COVID-19.

The in vivo study conducted in common marmosets (non-human primate model) showed that animals treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-1Î² had better outcomes than untreated animals. 74 The combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-1Î² is being evaluated for MERS in the MIRACLE trial. 75 The same two protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, when combined with ribavirin, were found to be associated with favorable clinical responses in SARS patients indicating therapeutic efficacy. 10 As an early attempt to evaluate these repurposed drugs in COVID-19, a controlled trial of ritonavirboosted lopinavir and interferon-Î± 2b therapy has been registered for hospitalized patients in China (ChiCTR2000029308). 76 Oral administration of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir has been used as an empirical drug for COVID-19 suspected cases in China hospitals even though there is no evidence of its efficacy. 2 Recently, the in vitro antiviral efficacy of approved drugs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, and chloroquine was compared with that of the two broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir and favipiravir for COVID-19. Among the evaluated drugs, both remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling COVID-19 in vitro. 63 The study also pointed out that the three nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, and favipiravir may not have significant in vivo antiviral effects against COVID-19 since higher concentrations were required to reduce the viral infection in vitro. Both remdesivir and chloroquine are being used for the treatment of other diseases and have a well-defined safety profile. Hence, such drugs can be used for evaluating their efficacy in patients of novel CoV infections.",37.718803455795864,14.447142734754191

We postulate that JAK2 inhibitors can be used to restrict the proinflammatory function of existing TH17 cells. In addition to JAK2 inhibitors, several FDA approved STAT3 inhibitors are also promising but may affect IL-21 signals in B cells.

Anti-rheumatic drugs as possible therapies: antimalarials, anti-IL6, anti-IL1 and baricitinib Some drugs usually used in rheumatologic field and targeting the host and its immune response seem to have the potential to interfere with CoViD-19 infection and their potential benefit is being studied in patients (Fig. 1) . The pathogenesis of CoViD-19 remains unclear, but modelling assays revealed a high degree of homology in the receptor binding domains between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. All coronaviruses express a surface glycoprotein termed a ""spike"" which bind to the host receptor for viral entry that has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2r) [1] , expressed by mature lung epithelial cells, enterocytes, kidney proximal tubular cells and endothelial cells [6] . After receptor binding, lysosomal proteases cleave the spike protein releasing the signal peptide that facilitates viral entry into the cell [7] . These mechanisms may be targeted and interrupted by therapies such as chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and preliminary data demonstrate that it may have clinical benefit in the management of CoViD-19 infected patients as determined by improved imaging and shortening of the diseases course [8] . We should note that hydroxychloroquine, which shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine but has a better safety profile and is frequently used particularly in connective tissue disease, has a more potent anti-viral effect than chloroquine in vitro. From the results of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models, a loading dose of 800 mg orally followed by 400 mg daily for four days reaches three times the potency of chloroquine and is therefore a promising drug for both the prevention and the treatment of CoViD-19, with low risk of toxicity [9] . These findings have led to several clinical trials that are ongoing to study the efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in CoViD-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine is thus being used in Italy for the treatment of CoViD-19 patients despite the absence of efficacy data in the clinical setting. In light of these data, the recommendation for rheumatic patients chronically taking antimalarial drugs is to not discontinue them, considering the antiviral efficacy and the immunomodulatory rather than immunosuppressive effect.",31.30387380962686,12.552731561022904

However, viral clearance was observed in only a small proportion of patients in ICU. Therefore, the clinical progression in these severe cases may not fit this biphasic model. Indeed, patients admitted to ICU were unable to defervesce without corticosteroid therapy or had significantly longer duration of fever compared with those in the non-ICU group. Persistent fever, lung damage and diseases progression could be partially explained by uncontrolled viral replication. To reduce the risk of disease progression and poor outcome, an effective antiviral to early reduce the viral load may be important. Several drugs are potential candidates to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, including remdesivir which is under clinical trial. 5 The host immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 may also contribute substantially to COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the current study, both older age and lower CD4 T cells count, indicators of immunosuppression, were significantly associated with ICU admission. For our patients who stayed in ICU, elevated interleukin 6 levels had been observed (data not shown), which is in consistent with the previous reports. 12 , 22 Therefore, the persistence of COVID-19 induced excessive but aberrant non-effective response which is associated with cytokine storm. 11 , 23 A small proportion of patients developed ARDS early in the clinical course and five of the patients in ICU did not improve significantly after viral control. Consistently, inflammation persists after viral clearance in SARS. 21 Taken together, these evidences indicate that disease progression may be a result of an over exuberant host response. Along this line, apart from effective antiviral agents which could decrease viral load at the early stage and in turn result in decreased immunopathological damage, the role of host-directed therapy could be an important tool to reduce the mortality. 24 Theoretically, corticosteroid treatment could have a role in the treatment of COVID-19 as it suppress lung inflammation. Despite of fever persistence and radiological worsening in the first week, most of the patients had normal temperature and improvement in images with or without supportive therapy from the second week after onset of symptoms. Most importantly, corticosteroid had been shown to delay clearance of MERS-CoV from respiratory tract and SARS-CoV from blood, respectively. 25 , 26 In the current study, delayed COVID-19 clearance was associated with ICU admission. Therefore, in agreement with the WHO guideline, we are against the usage of corticosteroid for the treatment of COVID-19. 4 , 27 There are some limitations of our study. First, a small proportion the patients were still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission. Therefore, clinical outcomes in these patients were not available and continued observations are still needed. Second, we did not test SARS-CoV-2 daily for everybody. Hence, the actual duration to viral clearance should be shorter than the estimated one. Meanwhile, we did not quantify the viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 and false negative of the PCR result for upper respiratory sample has also been reported. 15 For that reason, studies on the dynamic changes of the viral load are still warranted.",30.618875702427456,12.419990829698563

Screening patients and cancelling appointments only for those with fevers is not sufficient as there is known asymptomatic viral transmission and a prolonged incubation period. 3 Indeed, fever was only present in 43.9% of 7736 patients at time of hospital admission with Covid-19 in a study of 552 hospitals in mainland China. 4 Emerging research also suggests that COVID-19 viral particles remain viable in aerosol for several hours and can survive several days on multiple surfaces. 5 In summary, we feel the following measures should be immediately implemented:",29.963848106705306,10.970990250681941

Liver diseases including chronic viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcohol-related liver disease affect approximately 300 million people in China.

However, the exact cause of pre-existing liver conditions has not been outlined in the case studies of COVID-19 and the interaction between existing liver disease and COVID-19 has not been studied. Immune dysfunction-including lymphopenia, decreases of CD4+ T-cell levels, and abnormal cytokine levels (including cytokine storm)is a common feature in cases of COVID-19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality. For patients with chronic hepatitis B in immunotolerant phases or with viral suppression under long-term treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues, evidence of persistent liver injury and active viral replication after co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 need to be further investigated. In patients with COVID-19 with autoimmune hepatitis, the effects of administration of glucocorticoids on disease prognosis is unclear. Given the expression of the ACE2 receptor in cholangiocytes, whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 aggravates cholestasis in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, or leads to an increase in alkaline phosphatase and GGT, also needs to be monitored.

However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID).

Approximately 2-10% of patients with COVID-19 present with diarrhoea, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool and blood samples. 11 This evidence implicates the possibility of viral exposure in the liver. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the target cell, 7 where the virus replicates and subsequently infects other cells in the upper respiratory tract and lung tissue; patients then begin to have clinical symptoms and manifestations. Pathological studies in patients with SARS confirmed the presence of the virus in liver tissue, although the viral titre was relatively low because viral inclusions were not observed. 3 In patients with MERS, viral particles were not detectable in liver tissue. 4 Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), a diagnostic biomarker for cholangiocyte injury, has not been reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies; we found that it was elevated in 30 (54%) of 56 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalisation in our centre (unpublished). We also found that elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were observed in one (1Â·8%) of 56 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalisation. A preliminary study (albeit not peer-reviewed) suggested that ACE2 receptor expression is enriched in cholangiocytes, 12 indicating that SARS-CoV-2 might directly bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function. Nevertheless, pathological analysis of liver tissue from a patient who died from COVID-19 showed that viral inclusions were not observed in the liver. 13 It is also possible that the liver impairment is due to drug hepatotoxicity, which might explain the large variation observed across the different cohorts. In addition, immune-mediated inflammation, such as cytokine storm and pneumonia-associated hypoxia, might also contribute to liver injury or even develop into liver failure in patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.",31.148171319068503,12.047695057317974

COVID-19 spike protein uses the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the binding site to enter the host cell in tongue, bronchi and lungs. Any condition enhancing the expression of ACE2 would increase the vulnerability to infection. Heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase the expression of ACE2, which can be considered nature's endogenous ACE inhibitor at the cellular level. The renin-angiotensin system has 2 arms ( Figure, upper panel) : the pressor (conventional) arm, composed of Angiotensin II, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE), Angiotensin II-type 1 receptor (AT1R), and the depressor (non conventional) arm consisting of Angiotens in 1-7, ACE2, MAS receptor (MAS R) and Angiotensin II, type 2 receptor (AT2R) (2) . The ACE2 (the ""good"" guy, possibly ""the best of enzymes"") arm opposes the conventional arm and has beneficial effects in heart failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (3). COVID-19 spike protein is the ""ugly"" character in the play. It uses the ""good"" ACE2 as the binding site. While ACE is detectable in the entire capillary network of the alveoli in the human lung, ACE2 is primarily produced in club cells of distal bronchioles and type 2 pneumocytes in alveolar epithelium. Both cell types are involved in preventing ARDS. Club cells secrete a solution similar to surfactant and proteins protective against airway inflammation and oxidative stress. Type-2 pneumocytes are ""the defender of the alveolus"" and synthesize, secrete and recycle all components of the surfactant that regulates alveolar surface tension in the lungs. The binding of COVID-19 spike protein to ACE2 downregulates the enzyme, which in turn may contribute to ARDS for the unopposed, detrimental action of ACE (the ""bad"" guy or ""the worst of enzymes"") on lung tissue, triggering vasoconstriction, inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis. (Figure, lower panel) . The Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (4) highlighted the lack of any evidence supporting harmful effect of ACEi and ARBs in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak. This is important since an hypothesis suggests that ACEi might be helpful in treating COVID-19 ARDS. Chongqing Medical University is currently conducting a retrospective observational study that aims to evaluate the clinical differences between adult hypertensive patients with COVID-19 treated and those not treated with ACEi.

This is illustrated by recent reports that diverse viral families are unable to enter cells or replicate if the ubiquitin proteasome system is disabled by proteasome inhibitors, a treatment that also depletes free ubiquitin. Such treatment trapped viruses in the endosomes and dense lysosomes, but did not affect initial endocytosis [5] . By contrast, proteasomal inhibitors blocked endocytosis of influenza virus due to the blockade of ubiquitination of epsin 1, a cargo specific adaptor for clathrin [6] . For herpes simplex virus it was shown that UPS activity was required at a post-penetration step to transport the incoming capsid to the nucleus [7] . Thus, several unrelated viral families depend on the UPS system even before the onset of viral replication. In poxvirus-infected cells, two groups reported that inhibitors of the proteasome or of E1 enzymes delayed expression of early viral genes and blocked the formation of virus replication factories resulting in complete inhibition of intermediate and late gene expression [8, 9 ] . The UPS system is also required for the replication of coxsackie virus 3B since proteasome inhibition, ubiquitin knockdown, or increasing deubiquitinase activities all prevented CV3B replication [10] . Similarly, replication of human respiratory syncytial virus was decreased in the presence of proteasome inhibitors [11] . Although it has been speculated that proteasome inhibitors in clinical use might have anti-viral activity [8] , it has yet to be demonstrated that these compounds are able to inhibit viral replication in vivo.

Early identification of COVID-19 is important for the patients as well as the healthy population. Currently, the patients should be isolated for treatment from the healthy people for controlling the epidemic. It has been reported that chest CT is superior to RT-PCR in sensitivity for early detection of COVID-19. 22 Based on the epidemiological characteristics, clinically-diagnosed cases with typical CT features were treated with the same therapy in Hubei Province to offset the effects of possible false negative of the new coronavirus nucleic acid tests. 13 In our study, 44% and 36% pregnant women presented initial onset of fever in either laboratory-confirmed or clinicallydiagnosed group, which was less common than 87.9% in the nonpregnant population in the study by Guan et al. 11 and consistent with the previous study enrolling 9 pregnant women with COVID-19. 17 Currently, fever served as the basic screening flag in China. Absence of typical symptoms increased the difficulty of the surveillance in the pregnant population. Furthermore, the physiological findings about leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio due to adaptations to gestation could further complicate the situation. Nevertheless, no pregnant women were admitted to ICU.

As with unenhanced chest CT imaging of pregnant women during the epidemic in Wuhan, low dose technique was implemented with the DLP ranging from 50 to 150 mGy cm for diagnostic imaging in our study, which was safe for the fetuses. 23 Sixteen pregnant women were performed with post-partum CT in our study. As with the CT features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, the common characteristics in the pregnant group included pure GGO, GGO with consolidation or reticulation, and complete consolidation with predominantly peripheral distribution and bilateral lung involvement, which were similar to those of the non-pregnant group in our research as reported in the previous studies. 19 , 20 , 24 There were overlaps in imaging findings between COVID-19 and other viral infections, such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pneumonia, as well as H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 infections. 19 , 20 The patterns of GGOs or GGO with the above features in predominantly peripheral distribution will facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. 20 The above imaging findings could be mostly explained by a recently published research on the pathological investigation of COVID-19. 25 Diffuse alveolar injury superimposed with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline membrane formation was identified on pathology. Other findings included pulmonary edema and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (dominated by lymphocytes). Therefore, we have the GGOs, consolidations, and reticulations which indicate fibromyxoid exudates, the interstitial edema and the lymphocytes infiltrate resulting in the lymphopenia inside the blood. The more common consolidation and relatively higher TSS in the laboratoryconfirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant women suggested the more severity in pregnant women, except for three laboratoryconfirmed pregnant women showing no abnormalities related with COVID-19 pneumonia at CT. Therefore, there is no doubt that the CT study did a big favor in structuring the clinical treatment strategy for the pregnant women as we hoped. Fortunately, the infants were all normal without any evidence of vertical transmission from women with COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, which was consistent with the prior research by Chen et al. 16 While compared between the two pregnant groups, the consolidation were more frequent in the clinically-diagnosed group with a relatively higher TSS of 4 Â·8 (SD 3 Â·5), indicating relatively more severe lung involvement resulting from delayed treatment prior to a laboratory confirmation. Cases with initial negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 but high clinical suspicion were also reported in previous studies, and the SARS-CoV-2 was positive after repeated tests. 12 , 13 For the clinically-diagnosed patients, it is speculated that samples from the lower respiratory tract via lavage and repeat tests may be helpful to rule out the false negative results. Fortunately, the laboratory-negative cases with typical imaging findings were supposed to receive the same treatment protocol as the positive ones in China. Pleural effusion was identified in 6/16 (38%) and 6/25 (24%) patients in the laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant groups, which was more than that in the study by Song et al. 20 This phenomenon could be attributed to a common finding within 1-24 h of normal delivery. 26 Compared with adults, fewer children are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Nine children younger than 14 years out of 1011 patients were reported by Guan et al. 11 Our study revealed that the non-specific abnormalities (pure GGO or consolidation) distributed without peripheral predominance at CT unlike the adults. However, when superimposed with other pathogen infections, the pulmonary involvement was more severe, as simultaneous infection of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in one child was detected in our study. Nevertheless, it was difficult to distinguish if the consolidation was associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, since the consolidation and pleural effusion were also common in pure RSV infection. 27 The contact history and clinical symptoms of fever or cough may be helpful for the surveillance.",28.153257975292306,11.824509838480983

Accordingly, it is believed that the pulmonary lesions caused by COVID-19 infection are similar to those of pneumonia. More than 75% of suspected patients showed bilateral pneumonia [3] . In this context, the promising findings of several studies have highlighted the growing role of chest computed tomography (CT) scan for identifying the typical findings of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The common typical chest CT scan findings were summarized in Table. Among the published chest CT findings related to the COVID-19 infection, the most common imaging finding was pure ground-glass opacities with the occurrence rate of up to 74% (603 out of 807 patients). More than 62% of patients (224 out of 359) had mixed pattern opacities in their CT, which was a combination of consolidation, ground glass opacities, and reticular opacities. In addition, the bilateral distribution of lung lesions was the cardinal hallmark of COVID-19 with an occurrence rate of up to 76% (365 out of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 476 patients). More than 66% of lung lesions was peripherally distributed (399 out of 601 patients). [4, 20] .

We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported. Methods: Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared. Findings: Compared with the non-pregnant adults group ( n = 14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed ( n = 16) and clinically-diagnosed ( n = 25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults ( P = 0 Â·007, P < 0 Â·001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults ( P = 0 Â·001, P < 0 Â·001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twentythree patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6-9 days after initial CT scans. Interpretation: Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation. The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT.",30.264872935027185,11.142479835762188

Since its first description in December 2019, the total number of cases as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) had reached 191,127confirmed cases on February 18, 2020, with 7807 deaths [2] . The clinical picture and radiographic presentations were recently described [3, 4] and the clinical picture in nine pregnant women [5] were similar to non-pregnant women [3, 4] . One study showed that 15 pregnant patients with COVID-19 had mild disease [6] . All of the pregnant patients in one study and 66.7% of pregnant COVID-19 patients had C-section, moreover all the newborn survived [5, 6] . However, 4 of 9 (44%) pregnant COVID-19 patients had premature delivery [5] . In a previous study of MERS-CoV, there were 11 pregnant women [7] . A comparison between MERS-CoV and COVID-19 cases in pregnancy is shown in Table 1 . There was no difference in the age group of the patients, however, the gestational age was lower among MERS-CoV than COVID-19 patients. Of the MERS-CoV cases in pregnancy, 63.6% required intensive care unit admission and this is comparable to 50% of SARS pregnant women [8] . There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] . Thus, similar to the difference in the clinical presentation and course among SARS, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, there is also differences in the outcome and course of pregnant women with these coronaviruses' infection. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and outcome would guide healthcare authorities and public health on further risk mitigation and advise for pregnant women around the world.

Nevertheless, adverse effects of the viral infection, such as excessive viral replication or expression of the immune modulators leading to an overreaction of the immune system cannot be excluded yet. A possibility to reduce the risks on adverse effects would be the incorporation of a fail-safe mechanism into the OV therapy to abort viral replication if necessary. Only for HSV, drugs are available to inhibit viral replication [117] . Alternatively, virus with attenuated virulence or viruses with a different host range may be used. In addition, incorporation of suicide genes, such as thymidine kinase [117] , rat cytochrome P450 [118] or cytosine deaminase [119] , would allow inhibition of viral replication by using drugs as well. Moreover, it could add to the tumor lytic efficacy of the therapy [120] . During OV therapy, the immune modulator is not incorporated into the host genome and therefore expression levels are dependent on viral replication which is usually transient.

This finding suggests that improvement of the disease may depend on inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2, and that FPV controls the disease progression of COVID-19 by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2. Until recently, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 had not been well clarified. Since the infection of SARS-CoV-2 was thought to be self-limited and characterized by systemic inflammation reaction, symptomatic and supportive treatment was mainly recommended by the WHO and the National Health Commission of the PRC. This description is similar to MERS-CoV, for which nonspecific therapeutic interventions are often introduced to prevent severe mor- bidity and mortality [16] . How antivirals would contribute to control of the disease is controversial. Although there have been many registered clinical trials focusing on antiviral drugs for COVID-19, the timing, duration of treatment, and study endpoints have not been unified. In the current study, the time of viral clearance was introduced as a primary endpoint to evaluate the antiviral effect of FPV on the SARS-CoV-2 and successfully identify the priority of FPV. The relationship between the time of viral clearance and the improvement in CT image indicates that viral clearance is an ideal surrogate for the clinical endpoint. A limitation of the present study was that the relationship between the viral titer and the clinical prognosis was not well clarified. Future research could pay more attention to this point. More adverse events were observed in the control arm than in the experimental arm, and were similar to the adverse events observed in studies of AIDS treated by LPV/RTV. It is worth mentioning that the treatment duration of FPV in the present study was twice as long as that used for the treatment of influenza. However, the adverse events in the experimental arm were rare and tolerable, and none of the patients needed to discontinue FPV treatment. These results seem to suggest that the treatment duration of FPV can be prolonged if necessary.",30.626990924131732,10.810988830498445

Cytokines, such as the IFNs, TNF and many immunoregulatory interleukins, are among the earliest host defence factors to be induced following various viral infections. each induced cytokine binds to unique cognate cellular receptors, which are frequently ubiquitously expressed by most somatic cells, and thereby mediates distinct intracellular signalling events that help to inhibit viral infection. This inhibition can occur either directly, by inducing a specific antiviral state in which virus replication is blocked in responding cells (TABLE 2) , or through the regulation of the adaptive immune response (summarized elsewhere [12] [13] [14] [15] ). TNF, IFNs and the interleukins can all inhibit viral replication through both of these mechanisms; however, TNF and the IFNs more frequently inhibit viral replication through the direct induction of an intracellular antiviral state, whereas the interleukins tend to exert their effects more indirectly through modulation of the adaptive immune response. Here, we summarize our current understanding of the direct roles of antiviral cytokines, in particular type I, II and III IFNs and TNF, in dictating viral tropism and the mechanisms that they are known to use. We also discuss the prospects of exploiting these cytokines to enhance innate immune responses against zoonotic infections and to achieve improved specificity of tissue-targeted oncolytic virotherapy.",32.176450343916436,12.560252299106484

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",29.797132264601082,10.602132040743442

Particularly, the studies of small DNA tumor viruses have been extremely valuable in understanding the role of p53 and pRb in cell cycle control. For many viruses, such as the small DNA viruses and some Herpesviruses, the effects of infections with the viruses on the cell cycle are well understood. However, there are still many unanswered questions in regard to the exact outcomes of viralinduced cell cycle progression and arrest during infections with viruses such as HBV, HCV, HIV, and HTLV-1. Many studies that have analyzed the effects of these viruses on the host cell cycle have, by necessity, been conducted in immortalized or transformed cells. Since signaling pathways that control normal cell cycle progression are usually altered in immortalized or transformed cell lines, the effects of the viral protein, although valid in that specifi c cellular context, may not necessarily be similar during the course of a natural infection in normal cells. Effects of the viral proteins may be infl uenced by factors that are present in the transformed or immortalized cells as compared to normal cells as well as structural alteration, as described below, that might regulate these viral proteins in specifi c cellular systems. Future studies should focus on understanding the effects of viral proteins on the host cell cycle in systems that closely resemble a natural infection [ 8 ] . Moreover, many studies that have analyzed the effect of a particular viral protein on the host cell cycle were conducted in systems in which individual viral proteins were overexpressed, and often out of the context of the entire viral genome. These types of systems may not accurately refl ect the expression level of the viral protein during an actual infection. Therefore, it will be important in future studies to analyze the effects of viral proteins on the cell cycle when these proteins are expressed in the context of viral replication, and in the presence of other viral proteins.",28.186047147356916,10.331618531023668

It is mandatory, especially in a finite resource system, to balance the potential benefit of containment measures, such as postponing scheduled procedures, with negative health and social costs. Diverting the attention exclusively to the COVID-19 situation and overshadowing the everyday clinical practice may have substantial negative implications, especially for cancer patients. Re-allocating an excessive amount of health care personnel, both nurses and doctors, to the COVID-19 triage and management may stretch an already fragile system and potentially leave uncovered some vital activities, such as treatment administration, surgeries and inpatient assistance. It is well established that delayed oncologic surgery may lead to disease progressions and result in tumors no longer resectable, leading to worse survival outcomes. The same goes for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens administered with suboptimal timing. It should be emphasized that we are talking about patients potentially cured by oncologic treatments. Therefore, any delay of these fundamental procedures, either intentional or due to shortage of personnel, should be avoided. The same risk is present for the people who have scheduled screening activities (e.g. screening mammography for the early diagnosis of breast cancer). People should be advised to maintain their scheduled appointments, if the procedure is feasible safely, or at least to promptly reschedule their appointment when the epidemic is expected to slow its pace. For patients with advanced disease, as oncologists we know the enormous negative impact from disease progression in terms of both survival time and quality of life. The inability to deliver palliative care to patients unable to move from their homes and the management of treatment side-effects are other significant concerns from a forced quarantine. 5 Patients with advanced disease, and no suggestive symptoms of COVID-19, should keep receiving planned chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment, without unnecessary delays. Moreover, although postponing follow-up and cancer prevention appointments is a strategy to be considered, an excessive accumulation of visits or examinations risks burdening the national public health system over the next few months.",27.511095886820453,10.984354846564793

First, for patients admitted to the ICU, death might occur despite full intensive care support, including mechanical ventilation, ECMO, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. On modern ICUs, such deaths are expected to be infrequent; however, robust estimates of the number of deaths cannot be made from the mostly descriptive reports currently available. A second possible scenario for ICU and hospital patients is related to limitation of life-sustaining therapies because of poor predicted outcomes associated with old age, frailty, comorbidities, or profound disability, or because of effects of distributive limitations associated with lack of personnel, beds, or materials. A combination of these two factors often exists. A third scenario relates to patients admitted to the ICU or hospital whose deaths are not directly related to COVID-19. Especially in areas with high infection rates, patients might be admitted to the ICU with, for example, severe trauma or acute brain injury, test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the ICU stay, and eventually die because of the initial injury; these deaths will still be attributed to COVID-19 and included in the statistics. Similarly, some patients might have SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the actual contribution of the virus to the patient's death might be minimal. For example, in a patient with metastatic cancer or terminal organ failure, is the viral infection or the patient's underlying condition the cause of death? The actual role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in such deaths is particularly difficult to evaluate in countries where only one cause can be reported on a death certificate.",26.349096678574533,8.902878503167756

An estimated 500 000 people with severe dengue require hospitalization each year; a very large proportion of whom are children, resulting in a fatal outcome in about 2.5% of those affected. There is neither vaccine nor a specific antiviral treatment. Likewise, no antivirals are available for the treatment of life-threatening infections with other flaviviruses such as those caused by yellow fever virus [4] , Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The organization of the genome of flaviviruses resembles -to some extent -that of the related HCV, of which the viral serine protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase have been shown to be excellent targets for inhibition of viral replication (both in vitro and in the infected patients) [5] . So far, flavivirus NS3 protease inhibitors with a potency comparable to that of the HCV NS3 protease inhibitors have not yet been identified. Particular differences in the characteristics and structure of the different NS3 proteases may be the reason [6] . An exhaustive review on the flavivirus NS3 protease as a target for the design of inhibitors has recently been published [7] . Second, nucleoside as well as non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors of HCV have been and currently are in clinical development. They exert pan-genotype antiviral activity and have a high barrier to resistance [8] . Nucleoside polymerase inhibitors (that target the enzyme as their 5 0 -phosphorylated metabolite) have also been shown to exert pan-serotype anti-dengue virus activity in vitro and in dengue mouse models [9, 10] . Balipiravir, a nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitor, was evaluated for potential activity in dengue-infected patients. No protective activity was observed [11] . The lack of activity of balipiravir can very probably be ascribed to the very weak in vitro potency of this molecule against DENV and should not create any pessimism regarding the potential use of nucleoside analogs for the treatment of dengue. For HCV a large number of non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors have been reported and at least 4 different allosteric pockets for inhibition of the enzyme activity have been identified on the enzyme [5] . At least one cavity has been found in the dengue polymerase that may potentially serve as a pocket into which inhibitors of the enzyme could be designed [12] . In addition, the flavivirus NS5 gene encodes, besides the viral polymerase, also a methyltransferase (MTase) which is responsible for methylating the viral cap. This MTase is critical for viral replication and therefore represents a valid target for antiviral therapeutics. Efforts are ongoing to develop selective inhibitors of this enzyme [13] . Fourth, the flavivirus NS4b is an essential membrane-associated viral protein (not a homologue of the HCV NS4b) that has been shown to be the target of small molecule dengue inhibitors [14] . Also, an inhibitor of yellow fever virus replication was reported that targets NS4b [15] . We recently identified a class of highly potent and panserotype dengue virus inhibitors that target NS4b (our unpublished data). The exact mechanism by which these molecules target NS4b and thereby inhibit viral replication remains to be elucidated. Despite the fact that the precise function of NS4b is not well understood, this protein appears, akin to NS5a of HCV, to be an excellent target for the design of potent inhibitors of viral replication. Finally, inhibition of host factors that are essential for virus replication might be considered. For instance, an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme required for pyrimidine biosynthesis, was identified as an inhibitor of in vitro dengue virus replication but had no effect in dengue virusinfected mice [16] . Glycosylation inhibitors [N-nonyldeoxynojirimycin and celgosivir] have been shown to inhibit dengue virus replication (by misfolding of NS1). The activity of celgosivir has also been demonstrated in a dengue mouse model [17] and its activity is currently being explored in a clinical study (Celaden Drug Trial; URL: http://www.celaden.sg/). The design of appropriate clinical trials with dengue drugs might be challenging however. Recently, recommendations for the design of such trials have been published [3 ] .",31.14054125548775,12.504551106696141

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

This assay system can evaluate the inhibitory effects of test compounds in a single replication cycle of HIV-1. The results demonstrated that most of the other tested compounds either did not exert noticeable inhibitory effects on HIV-1 replication or exhibited strong cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (Table 1) . Moreover, although compound 4 exerted an inhibitory effect on viral replication, it displayed low solubility (Table 1) ; therefore, we did not evaluate this compound further. By contrast, two of our compounds, 12 and 23, as well as the two positive control compounds, exerted potent inhibitory effects on HIV-1 replication while exhibiting low cytotoxicity at the effective concentration inhibiting viral growth by 50 % (Fig. 5) .

In such cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered as a rescue therapy. In a study of ECMO for ARDS in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a similar coronavirus disease emerged in 2012, a significant decrease of inhospital mortality rate and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was found in patients treated with ECMO compared to those managed with conventional therapy [1] . However, with COVID-19, concerns have been raised about high mortality rate observed in an early report which included data on ECMO in infected patients [2] . It has been suggested that the compounded immunologic insult by both infection and extracorporeal circuit may counterbalance or even offset survival benefits [2] .

[3] Since 2002 there have been two other global outbreaks of highly-pathogenic coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS and MERS are not identical to SARS-CoV-2 in their genetic structures or clinical manifestations, the recent outbreaks of these viruses may provide insights on the effects of COVID-19 in the context of pregnancy. The literature on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are limited to a handful of case reports and series. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Many of these cases involved severe morbidity including the need for intensive care and cardiorespiratory support. Notably, there were cases of maternal mortality associated with SARS and MERS infection. The only published case-control study showed that pregnant women with SARS experienced worse outcomes than nonpregnant women of similar age. [10] Reports varied with respect to the effects of SARS and MERS on pregnancy outcomes. Spontaneous abortion has been reported among women infected with SARS and MERS in the first trimester.4 As well, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth have been reported in pregnancies affected by SARS and MERS in the second and third trimesters. [4, 9] It is important to note, however, that a number of pregnancies had good outcomes despite maternal infection with SARS or MERS. [6, 7, 8] Broadly speaking, and drawing upon our knowledge of other respiratory illnesses in pregnancy, adverse It remains to be seen whether the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses will be similar to those of SARS and MERS. To date, the reported case-fatality rate for the general population infected with COVID-19 is lower than that of either SARS or MERS (estimated at 1%-2% vs. 9%-10% and 35%-40%, respectively). Similarly, by now, there have been over 60 cases of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in China and the vast majority of these women have had mild to moderate pneumonia. [11, 12, 13, 14] To date here has been one case of severe maternal morbidity secondary to COVID-19 reported. [12] This 31-year-old woman was infected at 34 weeks gestation and went on to experience severe respiratory compromise and multi-organ dysfunction requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The pregnancy outcomes of the reported cases have been largely good, [11, 12, 13] with spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour being the most commonly reported adverse pregnancy outcomes. One stillbirth has been reported and this occurred in the case of severe maternal illness reported by Liu et al. [12] Given the limited data, it is too early to determine if higher rates of adverse outcomes are expected in pregnant women infected with COVID-19. As with SARS and MERS, pregnancy outcomes are likely to be strongly correlated with degree of maternal illness. [12] There has been no evidence of vertical (mother-to-infant) transmission found in any cases of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Additionally, analyses of amniotic fluid, serum, placenta, and breastmilk from pregnant women confirmed to have SARS or COVID-19 infection have found no detectable viral RNA, [8, 13] further supporting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Importantly, maternal infection with SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 has not been associated with teratogenicity. However, because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester (when embryogenesis occurs), risk of congenital anomaly associated with COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded.",27.273012589538688,10.473266575628129

Xiao and colleagues demonstrated that about a quarter of COVID-19 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in feces after viral clearance in respiratory tract. 27 However, these researchers did not address whether persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was more common in certain age group than the others (patient's ages ranged from 10 months to 78 years in this study).

Limitations of using a structure-based drug-design approach merits expansion of antiviral research efforts to include cellular targets that may be exploited for therapeutic intervention.

This implies HIV-and HCV-mediated effects in cell-cycle dysregulation are advantageous for viral replication, perhaps by prolonging the progression of cell death. Information unveiled from these studies presents further opportunity to investigate novel cell cycle-related targets, as well as interrogation of additional cellular networks including ubiquitination and nuclear transport pathways. Furthermore, Chan and coworkers reported that proteome changes detected in HIV-1-infected primary CD4 + T cells during peak viral replication are largely abolished in the presence of a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz, demonstrating that evaluation of antiviral effects during infection can be functionally validated with proteomics [24] .",25.11976121907708,8.803005288947094

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2, which have been responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2002 to 2004 and for the more recent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, respectively, interface with the RAAS through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme that physiologically counters RAAS activation but also functions as a receptor for both SARS viruses. 1, 2 The interaction between the SARS viruses and ACE2 has been proposed as a potential factor in their infectivity, 3, 4 and there are concerns about the use of RAAS inhibitors that may alter ACE2 and whether variation in ACE2 expression may be in part responsible for disease virulence in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. [5] [6] [7] [8] Indeed, some media sources and health systems have recently called for the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), both prophylactically and in the context of suspected Covid-19. Given the common use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs in patients with Covid-19 is urgently needed. Here, we highlight that the data in humans are too limited to support or refute these hypotheses and concerns.

Inhibition of ERK signaling through small molecule inhibitors was previously shown to suppress VEEV replication (Voss et al., 2014) , supporting the importance of the ERK pathway for VEEV replication. These data indicate that blocking EGR1 alone is not sufficient to dramatically impact VEEV replication, in agreement with our previous data where VEEV TrD replication in wildtype and EGR1 â/â mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs_) was comparable (Baer et al., 2016) . Given that ERK phosphorylates more than 50 substrates (Seger and Krebs, 1995; Pearson et al., 2001) and PERK stimulates multiple signaling components including other transcription factors (ATF4, Nrf2, CHOP (Hughes and Mallucci, 2019) ) the observed impact on viral replication may be peripheral to their regulation of EGR1 gene expression. Alternatively, since a modest impact on viral replication was observed following loss of EGR1, a combination of multiple ERK or PERK regulated factors may be needed to strongly impact VEEV replication. However, loss of EGR1 was sufficient to reduce VEEV induced apoptosis, indicating that its role is related to regulation of cell death pathways rather than impacting viral replication.",26.298451585882148,10.125643032947812

Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate. Answers to these questions are essential for formulating the principles of obstetric treatment for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, to facilitate efforts, both in China and glo bally, to prevent and control COVID-19 pneumonia in children and pregnant women, 3 we retrospectively collected and analysed detailed clinical data from pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.

Although the efficacy of antiviral therapy is still uncertain, combination treatment based on the inhibition of viral replication might reduce the inflammatory injury, and can allow the body to gradually produce enough virus-specific antibodies to clear the virus through the immune response, and ultimately cure the disease. There is a great debate on the use of corticosteroids for coronavirus infection such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [11, 12] and Middle East respiratory ryndrome (MERS) [13, 14] , and the data of systemic corticosteroid treatment in critical COVID-19 are lacking. The findings of this study support the use of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19.

Until today, six different strains of Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported, in addition to the newly emerged COVID-19 [2, 12] . 229E and NL63 strains of HCoVs belong to Alphacoronaviruses while OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 HCoVs belong to Betacoronaviruses [2, 11] . SARS and MERS HCoV are the most aggressive strains of coronaviruses, leaving about 800 deaths each. SARS HCoV has a 10% mortality rate, while MERS HCoV has a 36% mortality rate, according to the WHO [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . HCoVs generally are positive-sense and very long (30,000 bp) single-stranded RNA viruses. Two groups of protein characterize HCoVs; structural, such as Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N) Matrix (M) and Envelope (E), and non-structural proteins such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (nsp12) [11] . RdRp is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. RdRp is targeted in different RNA viruses, including Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Zika Virus (ZIKV), and coronaviruses (CoVs) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The active site of RdRp is highly conserved representing two successive aspartate residues protruding from a beta-turn structure making them surface accessible through the nucleotide channel (free nucleotides can pass through) [25, 26] Several in vitro and clinical trials started in China during the last month with the first approved drug, Favilavir, by the National Medical Products Administration of China is announced yesterday (18 February 2020) in Zhejiang province. Different directly acting antiviral drugs are approved against other viruses, by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), such as Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin against RdRp of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). These drugs are nucleotides derivative competing with physiological nucleotide for RdRp active site [22, 27, 28] . Additionally, a huge number of attempts to develop anti-RdRp compounds are under clinical testing against different viruses. The half-maximal Effective Concentration (EC50) for Ribavirin against COVID-19 is 109.5 Î¼M, while its half-maximum Inhibition Concentration (IC50) against Dengue virus is 8 Î¼M [29, 30] . Sofosbuvir show 4 Î¼M against the Zika virus [31] . Remdesivir shows EC90 of 1.76 Î¼M against COVID-19 in vitro [30] . We focus here in the present study on nucleotide inhibitors due to its strong evidence of inhibiting emerging viral RdRps [11, 16] . We build the COVID-19 RdRp model using homology modeling after sequence comparison to the available structures in the protein data bank [32] . Molecular docking is then performed to test some direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs against COVID-19 RdRp (Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Remidisvir, IDX-184). Additionally, the native nucleotides GTP and UTP, from which IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir are derived, are also tested against COVID-19 RdRp model.

Due to the health emergency, repositioning of approved therapeutic drugs [2] has been suggested to be the most efficient way to find a cure for this virus [3] . Several drugs have already been tested, among which chloroquine (CLQ), a well-known anti-malarial drug, is one of the most promising as it has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in recent clinical studies [4] . However, the mechanism of action of CLQ against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear as the drug seems to exert a broad range of potential antiviral effects [5] . Therefore, although CLQ is classically considered as an inhibitor of endocytic pathways through an elevation of endosomal pH [6] , its detailed molecular mechanisms of action as an antiviral compound is still an open issue [3, 5] . Interestingly, the drug was also shown to interfere with the terminal glycosylation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) [7] , which acts as a plasma membrane receptor for both SARS-CoV [8] and SARS-CoV-2 [9] . The authors of this study concluded that CLQ could act at several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle [7] . In any case, these data suggest the interesting and mostly unexplored possibility that CLQ could prevent virus attachment through a direct effect on host cell surface molecules.",28.455352288188017,9.57347278107754

First, the novel coronavirus may exert direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissue. This is supported by the detection of PCR fragments of coronavirus in blood and urine in 2003 SARS 18 and COVID-19 patients. 4 Recently, it has been shown that the novel coronavirus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor, which is identical to that of the SARS-CoV as reported in 2003. 19 Recent human tissue RNA-seq data demonstrated thatACE2 expression in urinary organs (kidney) was nearly 100-fold higher than in respiratory organs (lung). 20 Therefore, the kidney disease may be caused by coronavirus entering kidney cells through an ACE2 dependent pathway. Second, deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T lymphocyte or antibody) may damage the kidney. However, kidney microscopy specimens from SARS patients were reported to show a normal glomerular aspect and absence of electron-dense deposits. 5 This is not in support of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Clearly, potential pathological kidney changes in COVID-19 patients require further study. Third, virus-induced cytokines or mediators might exert indirect effects on renal tissue, such as hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis. In fact, some of the 2009 H1N1 patients had mild to moderate elevations of serum creatine kinase. 21 In keeping with this observation, 138 patients with COVID-19 disease, who were admitted in ICU, showed a tendency towards increased creatine kinase levels, 13 and the patients with kidney involvement in our study tended to have increased creatine kinase levels as well.",30.970564949272656,12.022920964872345

As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization.

Most transplant patients are on triple immunotherapy, compared to pwMS who are on monotherapy and even then, the level of immunosuppression is generally low. Hence, the mortality/morbidity risk to an individual on a DMT, infected with COVID-19, may be actually quite moderate to low. Another hypothesis being considered is that moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with COVID-19 infection. The severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by an over-exuberant immune response to the virus (Ramanathan et al., 2020) . As a result, several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in China and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus. Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxxx (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferon beta is also being trialled in COVID-19 based on its antiviral properties (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276688). Then there is the virology to take into account. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species (Andersen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. As it is a small RNA virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution. Vaccines take time to be developed, tested and introduced at a population level. Delaying treatment, de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory DMTs, such as interferonbeta, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, or interrupting dosing of DMTs to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of MS, especially as it may take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine. We, therefore, need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of COVID-19 in individuals with MS. If patients have active MS they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy DMTs. This should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virus.",28.877509527467936,10.597172956737017

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",28.59796911315822,11.378732177047395

Upon the emergence or re-emergence of viral outbreak, researchers use high-throughput screening approaches to determine rapidly effective small-molecule viral inhibitors and pharmacological compounds for clinical treatment. The research and development stages of small molecules are relatively inexpensive. Smallmolecule viral inhibitors are also convenient for oral administration. Generally, therapeutic small molecules are superior to other antiviral therapies, such as antibodies. Hence, their use is widespread in both developing and developed countries. The antiviral activities of smallmolecule viral inhibitors are typically not as potent as those of antibodies, and small molecules exhibit shorter half-life in vivo than those of antibodies.

It contains RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain at the C-terminal end which is essential for viral replication and methyltransferase at the N-terminal region for RNA capping 155, 179. These functions are essential for viral replication, thereby making NS5 a promising target for antiviral drug development. Inhibiting the polymerase or methyltransferase function can actively suppress virus growth and propagation in host cells 180. Both NITD-008 and Balapiravir are examples of nucleoside inhibitors, whereby NITD-008 corresponds to an adenosine analogue while balapiravir is another nucleoside analogue originally developed for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. However, NITD-008 was terminated due to severe side effects while balapiravir failed due to its low efficiency in clinical trials 21, 22. To search for novel antiviral peptide against the NS5 methyltranserase, Tambunan and colleagues (2014) screened over 300 commercial cyclic peptides and molecular docking results revealed two potential ligands, namely, tyr123-Prepro Endothelin (110-130) and urotensin II 181. Both peptides were shown to bind to the NS5 methyltranserase and formed stable complexes. Docking results suggested that tyr123-Prepro Endothelin (110-130) was found to bind to the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) site of NS5 with a ÎG of -24.73 kkal/mol while urotensin II bound to the RNA-cap site of NS5 with a ÎG of -19.04 kkal/mol. Nevertheless, further in vitro verification is required to elucidate the antiviral potential of these inhibitors. Despite the importance of the NS5 protein, there are limited antiviral peptide screening studies targeting the NS5 protein. Perhaps this is due to the lack of a crystal structure that contains the full length of the NS5 protein. With the recent publication of the crystal structure of the NS5 protein 182, development of antiviral peptide targeting the NS5 protein can be expected.",26.201523735164507,9.072363983878112

On March 9 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Currently, Italy is the second most affected country by COVID-19 infection after China. The first autochthonous infection case was confirmed in Italy on February 21 2020 and up to now (March 12), 12462 cases with 827 deaths have been registered in Italy. Considering the recent evolution of Italian epidemiologic picture, many health-care facilities will be likely in charge of managing patients affected by COVID-19 in the next days. The âL. Spallanzaniâ National Institute for the Infectious Diseases, IRCCS has been the first Italian hospital to admit patients affected by COVID-19. Therefore, it will be useful to share the protocol for the clinical management of COVID-19 confirmed cases, applied within our Institute, in order to support other facilities that may have a limited experience in treating COVID-19 patients.",29.31053530679081,10.405299775074688

First, during the life cycle of the coronavirus, PARP1 inhibitors may inhibit the viral growth through suppressing viral replication and impeding the binding of the nucleocapsid protein to viral RNAs [31, 34, 35, 36] , which can also be supported by our molecular docking results (see Section 2.6). Second, PARP1 inhibitors have been previously reported to play a critical role in regulating inflammatory response by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as NF-ÎºB, AP-1, IL-6 and downstream cytokines and chemokines [37, 38, 39, 40] . Also, it has been shown that the overactivation of PARP1 promotes energy (NAD + /ATP) consumption and drives cell death, exacerbating the inflammation response [37, 38, 39, 41] . PARP1 inhibitors thus may repress the NF-ÎºB-mediated pro-inflammatory signals, and reduce energy failure and subsequent cell death induced by necrosis, thus providing a clinical potential for attenuating the cytokine storm and inflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",23.652286953106415,9.204078241419008

HAART combines drugs targeting different stages of viral replication including the integration step catalyzed by the integrase protein (IN) (1) . Integration of viral DNA into host genome involves two steps catalyzed by IN: (i) cleavage of a dinucleotide from each 3'-end of the viral DNA (3'processing), and (ii) insertion of this processed viral DNA into the host DNA (strand-transfer) (2) . Clinical IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) target the catalytic site of the enzyme to specifically inhibit the DNA joining reaction, however, as with all anti-AIDS treatments, the continued success of these drugs is persistently disrupted by resistance mutations (1, 2) . Although 3'-processing can be carried out by monomeric IN (3) , the assembly of IN functional multimers is imperative for the strand-transfer activity (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) , and for virus particle maturation and production (reviewed in (9, 10) ).

Several previous studies have demonstrated that PARP1 is critical for viral replication [35, 42, 43] . For example, PARP1 has been reported to interact with hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (IAV) and promote its replication by triggering the degradation of host type I IFN receptor [44] . In addition, the ADP-ribosylation of adenoviral core proteins displays an antiviral defense mechanism [34] . Therefore, intervening the ADP-ribosylation mediated interplay between PARP1 and viral proteins may be another important pathway for PARP1 inhibitors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Experimental evidences support that even single nucleotide substitutions have significant effects on viral fitness, regardless they are synonymous or nonsynonymous, or they affect coding or non-coding genomic regions 31-37 . A common trend among all these studies is that, whenever fitness is evaluated in the standard host, the distribution of mutational effects is highly skewed towards deleterious effects, with a large fraction of mutations being lethal. Furthermore, increasing evidences suggest that the shape and location of the distribution of fitness effects depends on the host species, being the difference among two hosts (e.g., a tested host and the natural one) greater as their genetic divergence increases 12, 20, 38, 39 .",22.3470385312522,7.8630445232063115

Unexpectedly, here we report a non-severe patient with the longest duration of viral shedding. According to the investigation on the clinical and epidemiological information of this case, we concluded that this type of virus might have a low toxicity and transmissibility, but have a prolonged infective ability and was hardly to be eliminated in the body with regular therapy. However, infusion of plasma from recovered patients showed high efficiency in elimination of this virus. Our findings might shed light on the management of COVID-19.",17.81745691920408,6.599744305399864

As expected, cell death and tissue damage occurred much more quickly under these parameters. Interestingly (and contrary to intuition), this did not significantly alter the rate at which the infection spread through the tissue. Compare the final frame of row C (higher tolerance to viral load) to row D (lower tolerance to viral load) in Figure 3 . This shows the importance of creating spatiotemporal models of viral replication in tissues, as the balance of competing processes can lead to unexpected dynamics at the tissue, organ, and organism levels.",18.061990098023387,5.847369846070697
