Here, we describe a proposed intervention that would overcome these challenges by capitalizing upon Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs) that are engineered to replicate conditionally in the presence of the pathogen and spread between individuals -analogous to 'transmissible immunization' that occurs with live-attenuated vaccines (but without the potential for reversion to virulence). Building on analyses of HIV field data from sub-Saharan Africa, we construct a multiscale model, beginning at the single-cell level, to predict the effect of TIPs on individual patient viral loads and ultimately population-level disease prevalence. Our results show that a TIP, engineered with properties based on a recent HIV genetherapy trial, could stably lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by ,30-fold within 50 years and could complement current therapies. In contrast, optimistic antiretroviral therapy or vaccination campaigns alone could only lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by ,2fold over 50 years. The TIP's efficacy arises from its exploitation of the same risk factors as the pathogen, allowing it to autonomously penetrate superspreader populations, maintain efficacy despite behavioral disinhibition, and limit viral resistance. While demonstrated here for HIV, the TIP concept could apply broadly to many viral infectious diseases and would represent a new paradigm for disease control, away from pathogen eradication but toward robust disease suppression.",18.269347215974136,8.617324188201955

Our adjustments were made based on the prevalence of these risk factors in each province and their relative risk for childhood pneumonia as defined by Rudan et al. based on their review of the literature (Table 1) [11, 20] . Because of the elevated risk for hospitalized SARI in HIV-infected persons, we added an adjustment for HIV prevalence using the same equation [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] . We did not have data on HIV prevalence in children in Kenya, therefore we calculated this prevalence using an algorithm which took into account the prevalence of HIVinfected mothers from antenatal clinics and the expected vertical transmission rate, accounting for penetration of prevention-ofmother-to-child-transmission programs, and transmission through breastfeeding (Appendix S2). For persons $5 years old, the risk factors used for adjustment were household air pollution, crowding, and HIV prevalence. Due to a lack of studies found during a literature review of these risk factors for adult pneumonia, we assumed that the relative risk of SARI for each risk factor was the same as for children.",22.872622048267967,7.922364132496949

A marker for fungal exposure, extracellular polysaccharides, derived from Aspergillus and Penicillium are now known to be inversely associated with asthma [94] . A recent investigation of pooled sputum samples from asthma patients and controls identified 136 fungal species of which 90 species were more common in asthmatics. Psathyrella candolleana, Malassezia pachydermatis, Termitomyces clypeatus and Grifola sordulenta were most commonly found in asthmatics and Eremothecium sinecaudum, Systenostrema alba, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Vanderwaltozyma polyspora were more prevalent in the sputum samples of the control group [95] . Wheeler et al., have demonstrated that antifungal drugs cause a fungal dysbiosis in mice and this dysbiosis results in an increase in the severity of airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma [96] . It has been well recognised for centuries that mould exposure can lead to an exacerbation of asthma [84] . In certain patients, mould exposure can have detrimental effectsleading to increased disease severity, hospital admissions, and increased risk of bronchial reactivity and death [84] . Environmental risk factors such as pollen, animal dander and mould spores and their impact on asthma were examined from 1985 to 1989 in a cohort of asthmatics ranging in age from 5 to 34 years in Chicago, US. It was discovered that there was a 2.16 times greater chance of an asthma related death on days when the mould spore count reached >1000 spores per cubic meter. While factors such as genetics and the patients socioeconomic situation have important roles, there appears to be a temporal relationship between the high environmental spore count and subsequent asthma attacks [97] . The summer-autumn period of asthma admissions and deaths corresponds with the peak in environmental mould spores seen at this time [84] .",16.58553576180669,7.688156019630693

Both individual characteristics were significant in the Flu+ outbreaks, and autonomy adjusted for age was significant in the Flu-episodes. The influence of age on mortality in a context of influenza has already been described: a very high mortality rate (831/100,000 inhabitants) was reported in persons 90 years of age and older compared with those aged 65-69 years (23/100,000 inhabitants) [28] . In our univariate analysis, the higher risk was observed in the �90 group whose risk of death was at least 2.6 higher than the <70 group. When adjusted for autonomy, the impact of age was not significant in more autonomous residents in the Flu+ context and not at all in the Flucontext. The opposite analysis (autonomy adjusted for age) showed higher global impact in the less autonomous group (Flu-) or only in the �86 age group (Flu+). Age and autonomy are a reflection of resident's level of frailty. Clinical frailty scores were not used in this study, but in a previous study of patients with critical illness, they were associated with greater mortality, regardless of age [29] . This suggests that in addition to age, autonomy can be a valuable indicator for the assessment of outbreak impact in outbreak surveillance. Other studies have suggested that age and certain comorbidities are independent risk factors for the influenza mortality rate or that mortality increase according to the number of risk factors [28, 30] . Comorbidities and underlying diseases of various severities could reflect overall frailty and consequently the risk of death. In nursing homes, information about autonomy and age are easier to collect and interpret than data on comorbidities. These various approaches should be evaluated and compared in the goal of optimizing risk assessment among nursing home residents.",15.266788603817503,6.38011890121726

Here, we found that the initial pump speed of ECMO was associated with in-hospital mortality and AKI. The elevated RDW could be suggested as the risk factor for severe AKI in these patients. This was the first study to identify the risk factors of AKI in adult patients receiving ECMO support. Because AKI is the most common complication and a major risk factor of mortality, defining the risk factors for AKI in these patients is extremely important [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . This study is the largest ECMO assessment ever reported. Moreover, the association of pump speed with AKI and mortality is a novel finding. We showed that AKI, especially stage 3 AKI, was a significant risk factor for in-hospital mortality in patients receiving ECMO support. SAPS2 and serum sodium level were also important risk factors of in-hospital mortality. Along with these well-known and expected findings [11] [12] [13] [18] [19] [20] , we found that the initial pump speed of ECMO was significantly related to in-hospital mortality, with a 33% increased risk for every 1,000 rpm increase. The initial pump speed of ECMO was also a risk factor for both AKI and stage 3 AKI. On the other hand, the blood flow rate of ECMO was not associated with in-hospital mortality or AKI. Why a high pump speed, but not a high blood flow rate of ECMO, increases the risk of in-hospital mortality and AKI is not clear at this time. However, the ECMO pump can induce hemolysis, leukocyte and platelet destruction, and complement activation [21, 22] . Blood flow through the ECMO circuit is driven by centrifugal pump. A rotating impeller in centrifugal pumps spins, which creates a constrained vortex that suctions blood into the pump and propels it out toward the membrane oxygenator [23] . Hemolysis has been reported to be associated with AKI [24] . In addition, Lou et al. found that the pump speed was a risk factor for hemolysis and that hemolysis was associated with adverse outcomes in pediatric patients receiving ECMO [25] .",17.030331535026484,9.896516093621422

Methods: Ancillary study of an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study (LUNG SAFE study [1] ). Patients meeting ARDS criteria (Berlin definition) on day 1 or 2 of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure onset were included in the study and categorized as having ""common"" risk factors or not.

There was no statistical difference in the incidence of AKI after the introduction of an ERAS pathway. Thus, we observed no reduction in the incidence of AKI with the introduction of an ERAS pathway. Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an independent contributor to morbidity and mortality [1] . In view of this we evaluated factors that may be associated with the development of AKI after hip and knee arthroplasty and studied the subsequent effect AKI had on length of stay (LOS) and mortality. [2] . It is possible that this may be secondary to the routine post-operative admission of patients with risk factors to the HDU environment. Risk factors found to be associated with AKI were consistent with the results of previous studies [3] . Even Stage 1 AKI resulted in an increased mortality at one year. Interpretation of our findings is limited by confounding. Early recognition of risk factors will aid identification of patients at increased risk of AKI. Subsequent pre-optimisation and normalisation of reversible risk factors where possible as well as planning of appropriate post-operative care may reduce the burden of AKI. Introduction: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) has been identified as a common and clinically significant complication after major trauma requiring ICU admission [1] .",20.232607574712823,7.277069299800253

We aimed to investigate risk factors associated with isolation of multidrug-resistant pathogens in bronchiectasis exacerbations. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in two tertiary-care hospitals, enrolling patients when first exacerbation appeared. Multidrug-resistance was determined according to European Centre of Diseases Prevention and Control classification. Results: Two hundred thirty three exacerbations were included and microorganisms were isolated in 159 episodes. Multidrug-resistant pathogens were found in 20.1% episodes: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48.5%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%) and Extended spectrum betalactamase + Enterobacteriaceae (6.1%), and they were more frequent in exacerbations requiring hospitalization (24.5% vs. 10.2%, p: 0.016). Three independent multidrugresistant risk factors were found: chronic renal disease (Odds ratio (OR), 7.60, 95% CI 1.92-30.09), hospitalization in the previous year (OR, 3.88 95% CI 1.37-11.02) and prior multidrug-resistant isolation (OR, 5.58, 95% CI 2.02-15.46). The proportion of multidrug-resistant in the 233 exacerbations was as follows: 3.9% in patients without risk factors, 12.6% in those with 1 factor and 53.6% if ≥2 risk factors. Conclusions: Hospitalization in the previous year, chronic renal disease, and prior multidrug-resistant isolation are risk factors for identification multidrug-resistant pathogens in exacerbations.

Binomial models predict much narrower distributions than dynamic models. The consequence is illustrated in Fig. 4 , where we can see that the simple SI model accounts for the observed variability in FIV prevalence in males for a wide range of parameters. In contrast, the binomial test on the distribution of the infected cats among the 15 populations rejects the global binomial distribution hypothesis (p<0.006). To explain the data with a logistic regression model that assumes binomial distributions, additional risk factors need to be invoked. With dynamic models, risk factors are not required to explain the variability in the male disease prevalence observed here.

Thus, healthier persons will move towards better socioeconomic positions, compared to less healthier, leading to inequalities. (b)""Social causation"" proposes that a range of unequally spread material, psycho-social and behavioural factors, give rise to inequalities in health outcomes [6, 7] . Material factors include varying income levels and investments across infrastructure beneficial to the community. Psychosocial factors are the chronic stresses that arise from perceptions and experiences of personal status in an unequal society. Behavioral factors are, for example, the higher rates of smoking observed in poorer groups that lead to differential rates of diseases and mortality [8, 9] . (c) A ""life course perspective"" suggests that a multitude of factors across the life span (e.g. maternal malnutrition during fetal period, poor educational facilities in childhood, occupations with physical hazards etc.) determine and manifest disease trends observed over time. The ecosocial approach attempts to integrate these ecological, social and biological factors in disease causation through a dynamic process of their 'embodiment' i.e. ""we literally incorporate biological influences from the material and social world"" [10, 11] . There are several biological pathways that explain how social environment gets 'embodied' on health. One is the 'stress biology approach' whereby stress leads to chronic stimulation of the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal axis and the resultant hormonal changes increase risks of hypertension, insulin resistance, and hyperglycaemia [6] . The other relates to the advancing field of epigenetics, i.e. non-genetic modifiers of gene expression that are transmitted to future generation. They provide an explanation as to how environmental effects convert to lasting physiological changes and behavioral changes. An example is how psychological stress alters DNA methylation and histones in stress-sensitive brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. These changes modulate subsequent gene expression [12] . Another pathway is through modifications of telomeres in dividing somatic cells. Telomeres are DNA repeat sequences, which together with accompanying telomere-binding proteins, cap and protect chromosome ends. Their length shortens with each cycle of replication, which is an expression of accelerated ageing as this process ultimately leads to a loss of capacity to replicate. It has been shown that lower socio-economic groups demonstrate shortening of the length of telomeres, thus suggesting that these groups acquire features of accelerated ageing with its consequences [13, 14] .",18.52918777263268,11.675571653133993

Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries. Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times [51] . It is estimated that the prevalence of these critical risk factors in low-and middle-income countries decreased by 25% between 2000 and 2010, contributing to reductions in pneumonia incidence and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, even in countries where conjugate vaccines have not been available [3] .",18.925992008715475,8.477599035535615

In Taiwan, the free influenza vaccination is not included in the regular childhood immunization schedule, and parents may decide not to have the influenza vaccination administered if they have any concerns.

Third, several risk factors predisposing to AOM have been reported; these include age, socioeconomic status, tobacco smoke exposure, lack of breast-feeding, siblings, and day-care attendance [30] . However, most of this information is not disclosed in the NHIRD; therefore, we could not investigate whether some children have risk factors predisposing to AOM. Finally, as with all studies analyzing large administrative databases, there is potential for misclassification bias when using diagnostic codes to define AOM.

The questions included in the exercise were feasible for persons who are not accustomed to formal prioritization methods; AHP is known to be adapted for complex information situations, to be intuitively understandable and to allow scientists to score the attributes with minimal confusion. Our study has several limitations. First, it is commonly considered best practice to give a training exercise on EOE methods as well as provide a multi-page literature review on the topic in question to participating experts, prior to administering the questionnaire, however, this was not done here. In this case, experts were provided with a detailed document describing how to fill out the questionnaire, with examples, and were invited to contact the authors if they had any questions or confusion (see Image S1 in Supplementary Material). It is possible to ""calibrate"" experts, by including some items in the questionnaire for which a general scientific consensus or quantification already exists; the expert response to these questions can then be matched to the real answer in order to see how close that expert arrives. There was no calibration done in this study, largely due to the fact that there are almost no solidly quantified risks associated with MERS-CoV at present. Experts were weighted instead only on their confidence level for each question answered; however, it is always possible that experts are overconfident, giving scores that do not reflect their real uncertainty on their knowledge of a variable. Linguistic uncertainty in the questionnaire could have led to some bias; experts with varied origins and experience can interpret questions and imagine contexts differently, and this can be exacerbated by ambiguity or lack of specificity in questions. For the aggregation of our results, we used a mathematical approach by combining the weighted estimates of all experts. Another option would have been to use a more inclusive and participatory behavioral approach that would allow experts to revise their answers after seeing those of others and eventually come to a consensus together. However, empirical results have suggested that mathematical methods can outperform behavioral techniques in certain circumstances (60, 61) , and it is also possible that group dynamics could bias estimations of risks toward a more extreme consensus (62) . Overall, the experts were more certain in answering the AHP questions, which involved choosing and ranking risk factors. For all animal-animal or animal-human AHP questions, the experts consistently had mean confidence levels of close to 4 (out of 5), however, when asked to rank risk factors for asymptomatic human-human transmission, the mean confidence level was lower (closer to 3). When estimating minimum, most likely, and maximum transmission risks based on scenarios, the experts had lower overall mean confidence in their answers, with scores of between 2.8 and 3.2 for all estimations. This lower certainty is likely related to the fact that so few transmission risks for MERS have yet been quantified, whereas in choosing and ranking risk factors, there are already strong trends as presented in the literature.",19.573941414965883,8.371858479474776

There are still several question marks regarding how the virus transmits, where it originates and what the risk factors associated with infection are. Elucidating these questions will enable a better assessment of the risk the virus poses, as well as enabling the implementation of control strategies. One clear gap in the body of evidence surrounding MERS-CoV is the paucity of epidemiological studies aimed at identifying risk factors associated with MERS-CoV infection. In order to encourage such studies, WHO has prepared a protocol for case-control studies aimed at identifying such risk factors [34] . One hospital-based case-control study found few clinical predictors [35] . Up to November 2014, no case control or other epidemiological study to identify risk factors had been published.

Thrombotic AEs are severe AEs and patients with risk factors require a special care. Reported average incidence of IVIG-induced thrombosis ranges from 3 to 13% (149) . Recognized risk factors for IVIG-induced thrombosis Frontiers in Immunology | Primary Immunodeficiencies include male gender; age >60; diabetes; renal insufficiency, dyslipidemia; hypertension; immobility; coronary disease; pre-existing vascular disease, family history of early thromboembolic disease; atrial fibrillation, high-dose and high-speed IVIG infusions. IVIG-induced thrombosis is reported both as venous events such as thrombosis stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial ischemia events such as myocardial infarct and stroke. The mechanisms leading to IVIGassociated thrombosis are still not completely clear; three main mechanisms have been proposed, emphasizing the role of an increased blood viscosity causing a hypercoagulable state (150) , the role of anticardiolipin antibodies passively transferred through IVIG (151) , and the role of factor XIa or other biologically highly active factors passively transferred via IgG concentrates, such as PKA. Avoiding activated coagulation factors in IgG concentrates starts with appropriate anticoagulation of donated blood/plasma, i.e., careful mixing of anticoagulant and sample over the whole donation process. Alterations in an established manufacturing process neglecting appropriate controls can also lead to increased risk of transmission of activated coagulation factors. High MW proteins passively transferred by IVIG are probably contributing to this phenomenon (152) . In patients with other risk factors, such as vascular disease, the increase in blood viscosity can precipitate thromboembolic events. As elderly individuals are prone for such AEs, we like to point to the possibility of elevated altered/senescent self-reacting with infused homeostatic NAbs being a possible factor facilitating thrombotic events as well. A relationship between IVIG administration and cerebral vasospasm has also been suggested by Sztajzel et al. (153) ; blood viscosity is a determinant for oxygen delivery to the tissues, and changes in viscosity can lead to a reduction in cerebral or myocardial perfusion.",16.34229485937679,9.453846703589493

Baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 3 . High-dose IVIG induced thromboembolic events in 59 patients at low to medium IVIG doses. Marie et al. (163) observed that the frequency and type of arterial events was inversely related to the time elapsed from IVIG infusion; almost 50% (23 versus 21 reports) of arterial ischemic events occurred within 12 h following IVIG, while about 75% of venous thrombosis occurred after more than 24 h.

Risk factors should be assessed for each patient including instrumental exams when needed. Doppler ultrasound can be useful as early diagnostic tool for thrombosis or to detect the presence of abnormal blood flow especially after prolonged immobility.

Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to visualize, analyze and understand the distribution of infectious diseases over space and time, thereby revealing spatiotemporal trends, patterns and associations between the pathological factors and the geographic environments of the disease [26, 27] . Exploiting the analytical, modelling and simulation features of GIS has improved epidemiological outbreak investigation and response, in which recognizing the spatial spread and transmission dynamics of an emerging infectious disease is essential for advising on efficient disease control and prevention measures [28] . However, since the first reported case of MERS-CoV in 2012, there has been a paucity of studies addressing the spatial dimension of the distribution of this disease. With the use of ecological modelling in a GIS environment [29], a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors (bioclimatic variables). This suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role. However, the effects of environmental risk factors on disease transmission were not explicitly determined. A geo-additive regression model was also utilized to examine the risk factor levels of individuals for MERS-CoV mortality in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2015 [30], and significant spatial variation and clustering with a lower risk were found in Riyadh, Arar, Aljouf and Jizan, whereas a higher risk was observed in Qassim province. However, the spatial analysis lacked detail at the governorate and city levels. The application of an iterative empirical process in a GIS environment revealed that high-camel-density areas, camel convergence points (camel markets, barns, breeding sites and slaughterhouses), former MERS-CoV cases and high seroprevalence rates were the potential risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots in Kenya [31].

Because pneumonia is a complex heterogenous disease that can be caused by a variety of pathogens, 1) studying pneumonia patients with the same infectious pathogen can reduce heterogeneity, 2) exclusion of patients with underlying diseases can improve the ability to detect readmission risk factors associated with the current acute infections. Therefore, we investigated the rate of 90-day pneumoniarelated readmission in hospitalized children with MPP who had no basal or chronic disease. After comparing the clinical information of the first hospitalization between patients who were readmitted and not readmitted to the hospital, we obtained the following findings: 1) 48 (11.3%) children were readmitted within 90 days of the first MPP There are mixed infections with more than one pathogen, the total cases is not equal to 189.

The observed genetic correlation could indicate a causal overlap and an etiological role for infections in subgroups of mental disorders. It might also be the case that infections and immune responses could have a triggering role in the development of some mental disorders, with longlasting subsequent immune alterations in individuals with mental disorders, as is suspected in autoimmune diseases, where infections and susceptibility genes are considered the main risk factors 41 . Moreover, socioeconomic and educational factors might prove important, together with periods of psychological stress or altered behavior, in making the individual more susceptible to acquiring infections.

Also, it is important to highlight the potential existence of vaccination status biases in the dog lifestyle (free-ranging dogs) results considering that there were no data in the literature in order to adjust the OR. Thus, it is interesting to mention that the OR would be influenced by the fact that free-ranging dogs, especially non-vaccinated dogs, tend to be more exposed to CDV because of the greater possibility of contact with other non-vaccinated dogs and eventually CDV infected, especially in urban environments. However, for two studies [32, 53] among those included in the analyses of risk factors, we can infer the absence of biases of the vaccine status factor in the variables of age, race, sex and behavioral style of the animals in the regions of the Santa Cruz (Galapagos) and Cape Verde, considering that they are regions with no vaccination programs.",20.140685614115526,8.184632674016838

In particular, despite HEV GT3 being a zoonotic infection, a higher seroprevalence was not found in adult farmers than in other adults. This suggests that additional HEV risk factors need to be identified and evaluated. Confounders associated with the high HEV seroprevalence detected in both farmers and the hospital-attending population may be due to other risk factors rather than just direct contact with pigs. One potential risk factor might be consumption of internal pig organs, which is common in Vietnam. Other risk factors associated with high seroprevalence in human may be due to household flooding, drinking contaminated water or poor household hygiene. Future population-based studies, using random controls chosen by geographic area, should be performed to confirm or contradict these results.

Prominent among these social cognitive approaches is the theory of planned behavior (TPB) [11] . According to the theory, intention, defined as the extent to which individuals will invest effort in pursuit of an action, is the most proximal predictor of behavior. Intention is the function of attitude (i.e., personal evaluation of how good, useful, valuable, and pleasant the behavior is), subjective norm (i.e., beliefs that the behavior is consistent with the expectations of significant others), and perceived behavioral control (i.e., beliefs in the availability of sufficient personal resources, in relation to barriers or risk factors, to execute the behavior). The TPB has been widely applied and tested in health-related behavioral contexts with meta-analytic studies supporting its effectiveness in predicting various health behaviors [12, 13] .

However, when spatial analysis involves aggregated spatial data, results may be influenced by the spatial scale of aggregation, an effect known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). In this study, area level risk factors for both infections in 28,914 cats tested with ELISA were investigated by multivariable spatial Poisson regression models along with MAUP effect on spatial clustering and cluster detection (for postal codes, counties, and states) by Moran's test and spatial scan test, respectively. The study results indicate that the significance and magnitude of the association of risk factors with both infections varied with aggregation scale. Further more, Moran's test only identified spatial clustering at postal code and county levels of aggregation. Similarly, the spatial scan test indicated that the number, size, and location of clusters varied over aggregation scales. In conclusion, the association between infection and area was influenced by the choice of spatial scale and indicates the importance of study design and data analysis with respect to specific research questions.",17.63959739819018,8.40815939282573

Tackling risk factors may reduce transmission and infection. However, risk factors involved in one setting may not be generalizable in all settings due to differences in climate, residential environment, population genetic and cultural backgrounds. This study aims to identify risk factors of FRI and mono-viral infections in a tropical military environment. Methods: From year 2009 to 2012, military personnel with temperature ≥37.5°C, cough and/or sore throat, and personnel with no fever or no respiratory symptoms were recruited as cases and controls, respectively. Subjects provided nasal wash specimens and answered a standardized questionnaire. Resplex assays were used to determine the viral etiologies. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses of the variables were performed using appropriate descriptive tests and logistic regression modelling, respectively, with R program. Results: A total of 7,743 FRI cases and 1,247 non-FRI study controls were recruited. Increasing age [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.03; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.05], recruit camp (AOR = 4.67; 95 % CI = 3.99-5.46) and smoker (AOR = 1.31; 95 % CI = 1.13-1.52) were independent risk factors of FRI. Malay ethnicity was positively associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (AOR = 1.50; 95 % CI = 1.04-2.15) and coxsackie/echovirus (AOR = 1.67; 95 % CI = 1.19-2.36) mono-infection. Significant contact risk factors were stay-out personnel with ill household member (AOR = 4.96; 95 % CI = 3.39-7.24), and stay-in personnel with ill bunkmate and household member (AOR = 3.55; 95 % CI = 2.57-4.91). Staying in camp with none ill in bunk and at home was a protective factor against FRI (AOR = 0.80; 95 % CI = 0.64-0.99). These contact risk factors were similarly observed for the five most common viruses detected, namely adenovirus, rhinoviruses, influenza A and B, and coxsackie/echovirus. Conclusion: Increasing age, smoker, recruit-camp, stay-out personnel with ill household members and stay-in personnel with ill bunkmates were independent risk factors of FRI in a semi-closed military environment. Early identification and isolation of ill personnel from their bunk may be effective to prevent and reduce transmission and disease burden.",18.93020240403787,7.505077900272126

When discussing driver 1, reference was made to some personal factors potentially due to an age-at-exposure related effect, fitting under the umbrella of developmentally-related effects, i.e., education in AD, cranial perimeter in north-Korean women, or early symptoms, such as scoliosis or constipation in PD (Stern et al., 2012) . This multifaceted and disperse panorama might be too wide for a satisfactory etiologically oriented approach to sCNDD. Insofar as the focus is AD or dementia, however, the driver notion constitutes the best structured etiologic and public health approach. A recent review addressing arterial hypertension, T2DM, hypercholesterolemia, physical activity, depression educational attainment, and smoking history (all personal factors) and risk of AD emphasized the non-independent nature of such factors (Norton et al., 2014) . Correcting for dependence, the authors estimated that, assuming causality underlying the associations, the AD attributable proportion reduced by a control of 10% of risk factors per decade would be 8.3% worldwide in 2050 (Norton et al., 2014) . When these risk factors were considered with regard to other sCNDD, the established association patterns were weaker. For instance, no excess risk for PD from T2DM was observed, when PD onset was controlled for Simon et al. (2007) and Palacios et al. (2011) . In contrast, other studies reported modest increases (Schernhammer et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2012) . We believe that the outline shown in Figure 2 (Norton et al., 2014) illustrates the state of art in public health prevention of sCNDD (entity-specific and mainly based on type-4 drivers). We propose that a complementary etiologic overview of sCNDD from personal factors should incorporate goals and interpretations from other drivers, and driver 1 in particular, for late-life sCNDD, as illustrated by a potential multiple outcome that combines (though not necessarily in the same individual) protein deposits generating sCNDD, T2DM as a result of Islet amyloid peptide (IAPP), and vascular wall lesions from amyloid deposits such as Aβ, lactadherin (Peng et al., 2005) and transthyretin (TTR; Coelho et al., 2013) .",18.44945268959702,5.062304398375901

Effective pandemic management requires support from the population at risk for measures undertaken to mitigate the pandemic's spread. Previous studies during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 have shown that individual beliefs and perceptions play an important role in subsequent desired behavioral change (Tang and Wong, 2003; Lau et al., 2003) . Higher perception on effectiveness of measures undertaken (Lau et al., 2003; Tang and Wong, 2004) and higher perceived threat of the disease led to higher rates of positive behavioral change, and better knowledge also increased the uptake of preventive measures (Leung et al., 2004; Leung et al., 2005) . Similarly, in an anticipated H5N1 epidemic, these factors also influenced both self and community protective behavior (Lau et al., 2007) During the current influenza pandemic, studies have found that the individual's emotional status mediates behavioral response (Jones and Salathe, 2009) ) and that perceived severity and susceptibility to disease and perceived effectiveness of specific behaviors resulted in the corresponding recommended behavior changes (Rubin et al., 2009; Seale et al., 2009) . To increase positive perceptions, clear dissemination of information is vital to reduce misconceptions (Lau et al., 2009) . It is therefore important to perform behavioral studies in different populations to understand the determinants that influence behaviors. However, there have been few studies (Mohd Shahriman et al., 2009; Zairina et al., 2011) on the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the influenza A pandemic in Malaysia. As such, there is a need to understand the factors influencing such behavioral changes to promote effective management of influenza A pandemics in this country. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) associated with complications of H1N1, effectiveness of treatment, preventive measures and health promotion of Influenza A (H1N1) among patients attending Klinik Kesihatan Jinjang in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2010.",14.372504806774394,7.149906913131612

The main differences between the two countries included the slightly older age of cases in SK, the epidemic pattern and the risk factors for infection. SK had a predominantly nosocomial transmission pattern, with 490% of cases acquiring infection in the health system. In contrast, in KSA, the occurrence of MERS-CoV was characterized by a very mixed epidemic pattern 15 with a diversity of risk factors for disease, and 460% of cases had no known risk factor for infection. This finding is consistent with other published studies indicating a high proportion of cases without animal or nosocomial contact. 8, 15, 25, 26 Interestingly, despite the large difference in nosocomial cases between SK and KSA, the rate of healthcare worker cases was not significantly different between countries, thus highlighting the high-occupational health risk that MERS-CoV poses to health workers. The epidemic pattern in KSA has been substantially different each year from 2012 to 2015 and exhibited an absence of seasonality, varying timing of annual peaks and a mixture of sporadic and epidemic patterns. The large epidemic peaks in KSA were not well explained by the estimated R 0 of 0.6-1.3. [27] [28] [29] In contrast, the epidemic curve in SK was clearly epidemic in pattern. The demographic features of cases (such as age and sex) were similar and have been described previously in KSA [28] [29] [30] and SK; 20,21,31,32 however, cases were slightly older in SK. In addition to the higher proportion of male cases with underlying comorbidities, the reasons for males being more at risk may be related to various socio-cultural behaviors. One possible explanation for the excess of male cases is that females are more likely to adopt hygienic measures and health-seeking behaviors, as observed during past influenza pandemics, such as that of H1N1. 33 Women are also more likely in KSA to wear face veils, thus potentially decreasing exposure. However, this cultural practice is not the case in SK, which also had a male predominance. 34 The predominance of male cases may also be associated with the high prevalence of smoking, particularly in middle-aged males in the Republic of Korea, 32 which has been considered an independent risk factor of respiratory infections, such as pneumonia. 35 However, the association between smoking and MERS-CoV infection requires more supportive evidence.",13.050517195316075,5.711195872076523

An increasing number of risk factors are thought to interact to cause a transition from uterine quiescence toward preterm labour or PPROM. Since many of the risk factors result in increased systemic infl ammation, increasing stimulation of the infection or infl ammation pathway might explain some of the increases in preterm births associated with multiple risk factors. 20 Defi ning risk factors for prediction of preterm birth is a reasonable goal for several reasons. First, identifi cation of at-risk women allows initiation of risk-specifi c treatment. 21 Second, the risk factors might defi ne a population useful for studying specifi c interventions. Finally, identifi cation of risk factors might provide important insights into mechanisms leading to preterm birth.

This review was kept as broad as possible to have a complete overview of all factors concerning biosecurity, and then crossreferenced with previous biosecurity questionnaires and a biosecurity reference work (Dewulf and Van Immerseel, 2018) . For this reason, a search of the PubMed database was performed with this combination of terms: ""name of disease and/or pathogen,"" or ""cattle,"" ""risk factors"" or ""epidemiology"" or ""prevalence"" or ""biosecurity measures"" or ""control measures."" The list of risk factors and biosecurity measures for each disease was integrated into an exhaustive list with all known (published) risk factors and biosecurity measures relevant for veal calves. If possible, a corresponding biosecurity measure was identified for each risk factor. Risk factors that cannot be controlled, or for which no biosecurity measure is available (e.g., birth weight, weather), as well as risk factors related to parturition or shortly thereafter (e.g., hygiene at parturition and provision of colostrum) were discarded. Though this last category is considered important, these risk factors are outside the control of the veal farmer because the animals arrive at two weeks of age. The total list of biosecurity measures is provided in Annex 1.

Moreover, it is clear that labor-intensive industries are relatively more at risk to such losses. In addition, geographical aspects have to be considered, as the virus-bearing mosquitos favor areas that have high temperatures and water available. Furthermore, socioeconomic aspects are important, as developed countries have a greater capacity to provide appropriate treatment smoothly. Therefore, the labor intensity of an industry and the geographical and socioeconomic aspects should be taken into account to identify regions where the risk of dengue virus infection is high. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has indicated that risk results from the interaction of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure (IPCC 2014). The life cycle assessment framework for adaptive planning (LCA-AP) to climate change adopted this concept and is able to evaluate the potential climatic effects on industries throughout the supply chain (Nakano 2015a) . This method quantifies inputs (e.g., water and workforce) to industrial activities that could be affected by climatic factors. Such inventory analysis results indicate the risk of exposure to the infection (Nakano 2015a) . In LCA-AP, the inventory analysis results are adjusted by accounting for the geographical aspect (hazard) and the socioeconomic aspect (vulnerability). Furthermore, LCA-AP is able to utilize the wellestablished LCA database. LCA-AP was therefore used in this study to evaluate the risk to the industry of dengue infection through the international supply chain. The potential effects of dengue infection were calculated by multiplying the inventory analysis result and a factor accounting for the country-specific climate hazard, as well as the socioeconomic vulnerability characteristics, as follows:",16.888826824052774,7.847140894222532

AIR TRAVEL AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE Specific Recommendation for Some Respiratory Diseases,"Apart from venous stasis, there is a lack of agreement regarding other factors associated with air travel that could contribute to DVT such as dehydration, favored by the low humidity of the cabin and in some cases increased by the diuretic effect of coffee or alcoholic drinks, and the hypobaric hypoxia associated with pressurized cabins. Dehydration could predispose to DVT as a result of hemoconcentration and blood hyperviscosity, although this hypothesis has not been confirmed. It has been observed in experimental studies that hypobaric hypoxia favors activation of clotting 153, 154 and reduces physiologic fibrinolytic activity of endothelial cells 154 ; however, those results have not been reproduced in subsequent studies. 155 Incidence and risk of VTD. Studies addressing the incidence and risk of thrombosis associated with long-distance flights have employed a variety of different methods and yielded disparate results. For passengers with a high risk of thrombosis due to the presence of additional risk factors the incidence of VTD appears to be high, from 3% to 5%. 156, 157 In patients at low or moderate risk the incidence drops to between 0% and 1%. 157, 158 Most of the VTD events that were identified were asymptomatic DVT that exclusively affected the venous territory of the calf, although the screening method used in almost all of the studies involved venous compression ultrasound with or without Doppler, raising questions over the results due to the limited sensitivity of the technique for distal clots. The influence of other individual risk factors appears to be decisive in generating DVT. 159 The incidence of pulmonary embolism has been assessed in cohort studies. [160] [161] [162] According to data collected in Paris airports between 1984 and 1998, the incidence of this entity has increased. 160 Significant differences have been described in incidence rates according to distance traveled, ranging from 0.01 per 106 passengers for distances of less than 5000 km to 4.8 cases per 106 passengers in flights of more than 10 000 km. 161 Differences were also seen according to distance traveled in a study performed at Madrid Barajas Airport. 162 In flights lasting more than 8 hours the incidence of pulmonary embolism was 1.65 per 106 passengers and in flights lasting 6 to 8 hours it was 0.65 per 106 passengers, while no cases were observed in flights lasting less than 6 hours. Consequently, 6 hours has been considered the cutoff for recommending general measures for the periodic movement of the limbs. 163 The relative risk of VTD is difficult to establish due to the heterogeneity of the studies. 152, 157, 164 Considering only air travel, the risk is not clear (odds ratio, 1.3), 164 and consequently, it could not be considered as an independent risk factor. However, in passengers with additional risk factors for thrombosis, the odds ratio increased in all studies to represent a 3-fold to 4-fold higher risk of VTD. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the immobility during a flight lasting more than 8 hours increases the levels of certain markers of clotting in subjects without risk factors for thrombosis, but it remains to be established whether this represents an increased risk of VTD. 165 Prophylactic measures. Patients must be assessed individually and the presence of other risk factors for venous thrombosis identified (Table 6 ) in order to adopt prophylactic interventions. Classification of the risk as moderate or high in these circumstances is not well established. It seems reasonable to extrapolate the impact of each of these factors on VTD.",17.606218577205368,8.338596400889486

The genomic pool of this macro-community is named microbiome. The gut microbiota is essential for the complete development of the immune system, representing a binary network in which the microbiota interact with the host providing important immune and physiologic function and conversely the bacteria protect themselves from host immune defense. Alterations in the balance of the gut microbiome due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors can now be associated with detrimental or protective effects in experimental autoimmune diseases. These gut microbiome alterations can unbalance the gastrointestinal immune responses and influence distal effector sites leading to CNS disease including both demyelination and affective disorders. The current range of risk factors for MS includes genetic makeup and environmental elements. Of interest to this review is the consistency between this range of MS risk factors and the gut microbiome.

Recent therapy or repeated courses of therapy with b-lactams, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones are risk factors for pneumococcal resistance to the same class of antibiotic [181, 193, 195, 196] . One study found that use of either a b-lactam or macrolide within the previous 6 months predicted an increased likelihood that, if pneumococcal bacteremia is present, the organism would be penicillin resistant [196] . Other studies have shown that repeated use of fluoroquinolones predicts an increased risk of infection with fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococci [195, 197] . Whether this risk applies equally to all fluoroquinolones or is more of a concern for less active antipneumococcal agents (levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) than for more active agents (moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin) is uncertain [190, 197, 198] .",18.987902773444297,9.05608317112779

This variation implies that nongenetic (i.e., environmental and lifestyle) factors can be quite important as well. The roles of genetic, social (i.e, environmental), individual (i.e., behavioral and lifestyle), and stochastic (i.e., chance) factors in the causation of disease and mortality are complementary and interactive. These factors do not usually act independently but in innumerable complex combinations and variations, with different degrees of influence under different circumstances. Their relative impact differs for different parts of the age cycle, different groups in the population (e.g., sex, race, ethnic, marital, and socioeconomic groups), and different life experiences. Early life experiences affect health and mortality in later life as well as later-life experiences, greatly augmenting the role of environmental and behavioral factors in later life.

Finally, the analysis of genetic-environmental interactions in population studies is still in its infancy. Large numbers of people are needed to make sense of subgroup data.

For example a lack of due diligence can expose the population to the risk of infection for far longer than necessary, as was the case with BSE. Conversely, the overzealous application of the precautionary principle can destroy the livelihood of a population, impact its food supply, limit development, and entrench or exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantage (World Health Organization, 2004) . Furthermore, when the zoonotic risk is new, attempts to explain the choice of policy are likely to be further complicated by uncertainty regarding the precise risk of infection, the drivers of disease emergence, and the measures needed to control the risk of infection.

Protective factors are attributes of the agent, host, and environment that decrease risk of the disease. Assessment of risk and protective factors involves the comparison of frequency of disease in a group exposed to those factors with disease frequency in the unexposed group. The relative risk (RR) is the ratio of risk of disease among persons in an exposed population to that in an unexposed population. RRs best reflect the effect of an exposure of interest when the groups being compared are similar in all variables being evaluated that might alter the RR except for the exposure of interest or when the RRs are adjusted to account for the known differences in these variables. An RR of 1.0 indicates identical risk in the compared groups; an RR greater than 1.0 indicates that those with the exposure have a higher risk than those without, and an RR less than 1.0 indicates the oppositethat those with the exposure have a lower risk than those without. It is important to differentiate the RR from the attributable risk (AR) -the absolute amount of risk directly due to exposure. AR is estimated from the difference between the risk of developing a disease in the exposed and unexposed groups. An AR of zero means that there is no difference in risk of disease between the exposed and unexposed groups. Pragmatically, in epidemiologic studies it is often useful to compare risk factors by looking at odds. The concept of odds is slightly different from that of risk, and is used when the total number of persons who may have been exposed to a situation or agent is not actually known, as is frequently the case in epidemiologic investigations. The odds of an event occurring is the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur. Odds compare the number of ill persons known to be exposed to a particular factor to the number of non-ill persons known to be exposed to that factor:",16.721377510066617,8.541001558683838

In 2012, the cattle industry decided that more information was needed on risk factors for mortality in both veal herds and herds of origin to enable implementation of risk mitigating measures. Routinely collected data were available from seven different data sources and contained information from 2.4 million white veal calves that were fattened in the period between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2014. Survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier), multilevel Poisson and multilevel Logistic regression models were applied to analyse the data. Two different models were assembled in which risk factors for veal calf mortality in respectively veal herds and herds of origin were identified. Univariable and multivariable regression techniques were used to detect risk factors significantly associated with mortality of veal calves during the fattening period. During the study period, the mean mortality was 4.9% per production cycle. The probability to die was highest during the first weeks after arrival in the veal herds and declined thereafter. Important risk factors included a veal herds with a higher use of antimicrobials, hair colour as proxy for breed, certain countries of origin, veal herd management with a limited amount of supplied feed and a not having an all-in / all-out system. A higher body weight at arrival in the veal herd was associated with lower mortality as well as veal calves that were fed an above median amount of milk, roughage and concentrates. From the calves that were fattened during the study period, observations of 1.1 million calves originated from the Netherlands and were available to study risk factors for veal calf mortality associated with the herd of origin. Important risk factors included purchase, herds with high mortality rates in the quarter in which the calf was born, fast growth in herd size, high cattle replacement rates and a higher antibiotic use in the quarter of birth. Calves that originated from herds that were certified BVD-free, Salmonella-unsuspected or Paratuberculosis-unsuspected, had a lower odds to die during the subsequent fattening period in a veal herd. Veal calf mortality was influenced by risk factors at the herd of origin as well as at veal herds. Adequate collaboration between the different industries is necessary to optimize veal calf management leading to a reduction in veal calf mortality during the fattening period. (I.M.G.A.

For both lung cancer and COPD, we first computed PAFs separately for smoking and solid-fuel use. COPD and lung cancer are caused by multiple risk factors acting simultaneously, and hence a proportion of deaths might be prevented by reducing exposure to either factor. 9,12,13 For example, some COPD deaths among smokers who cook with solid fuels may be prevented by smoking prevention or by use of clean fuels. As a result of multicausality, the PAFs for multiple risk factors overlap, and cannot be combined by simple addition. We estimated the PAFs for the combined effects of smoking and solid fuel, accounting for multicausality and avoiding double-counting the overlap of multiple risk factors: 9,12-14 PAF i =PAF of the i th risk factor n=number of risk factors Three conditions must hold when using the above equation. First, exposures to risks should be uncorrelated. The cross-province correlation coefficient between solid-fuel use and smoking, from the data sources described in webappendix 1, was 0·04 (95% CI −0·32 to 0·40, p=0·82) for men and −0·11 (−0·45 to 0·26, p=0·56) for women, indicating small and non-significant correlation. We also examined individual-level correlation with the 2006 panel from The China Health and Nutrition Survey (a multistage, random cluster survey, including 9788 adults in nine provinces throughout China with significant variation in socioeconomic and health status). 15 61% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did not use solid fuels and 63% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did. The odds ratios for smoking, comparing solid-fuel users to non-users, was 1·07 (0·95−1·20) for men and 1·02 (0·76−1·36) for women, showing uncorrelated exposures. The second condition is that the hazardous effects of one risk are not mediated through other risks. Smoking and solid-fuel combustion are both sources of respirable pollutants, but the effects of pollutants from one source are not mediated through exposure to the other. The third condition is that the proportional effects of one risk do not depend on exposure to the other risk factor. The proportional mortality study of smoking in China showed that the relative risks of lung cancer and respiratory-disease mortality among Chinese smokers were not modified by background disease levels, 16 which is consistent with no effect modification of relative risks between these two risks.",18.43295619655875,6.205356062643027

Additionally, being able to predict the most likely pathogen (virus, M. bovis, or Pasteurellaceae) involved at the time of the first visit based on easily measurable environmental or circumstantial factors would be of great practical value to justify antimicrobial use. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to identify at the herd level pathogen-specific risk factors for respiratory viruses and bacteria involved in epidemic outbreaks of respiratory disease.",21.73446054560328,9.443701596616055

Thus the 1983 statement noted that direct or indirect questions regarding donors' sexual preferences were inappropriate. Nonetheless, the blood bank in San Francisco developed a process whereby donors could discreetly exclude themselves by answering ""yes"" or ""no"" to a block of questions about known AIDS risk factors. By mid-1983 many blood collection organizations, particularly those in cities at high risk, had adopted a donor qualification process known as self-deferral by which presenting donors were provided with information about AIDS risk factors and where those with such risk factors were asked not to donate. There was also outreach to homosexual community organizations to discourage donation from at-risk men. In New York City, and later elsewhere, the ""confidential unit exclusion"" procedures were introduced that allowed individuals to give blood but then inform the blood bank of their nondisclosed risk behaviors so the blood units would be discarded or used for research.",20.648467154081303,7.654503984273942

The timing of onset of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation can be variable depending upon the host factors, underlying disease and the type of immunosuppressive therapies. In our study, the recovered patients had positive RT-PCR test results 4-17 days later. The key risk factors for reactivation would include 3 categories: (1) host status, (2) virologic factors and (3) type and degree of immunosuppression. Host factors may include sex, older age, type of disease needing immunosuppression. Although we could not identify risk factors for these host factors in the current study, the potential requires further large cohort confirmation. The virologic factors associated with increased risk of reactivation include high baseline SARS-CoV-2 load and variable genotype. SARS-CoV-2 viral load would also linked to treatment response, disease severity and progression. 8 The association of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes and viral load with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation will be an important question to address. In our study, all the patients received antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir or Arbidol). These cases suggest that SARS-CoV-2 reactivation may occur whatever the antiviral therapy used. These host and virologic factors are important considerations that may further increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Therefore, the assessment of host as well as virologic risk factors should be important caveats to help decide whether to initiate prophylactic therapy and immunosuppression. Immunosuppressive therapies are the commonly used causative agents. These agents have a general mechanism that inhibits many immune functions. For example, steroid inhibits cellmediated immunity by suppressing interleukins production which is important for T and B cell proliferation. 9 It is thus not surprising that these general immunosuppressive effects result in broad immune dysfunctions and potential SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.",18.78263075795638,6.034298968080715

Study participants have learned to be cautious about commitment in romantic relationships and tend to hedge their bets by having multiple partners and various kinds of relationships. Moreover, four contextual factors appear to be critical in limiting condom use: (1) condoms are not always available when passions run high; lack of a condom is often not a barrier to having sex; (2) the decision to use a condom flows from a culturally informed assessment of a partner's presumed level of risk rather than from a public health understanding of risky behaviors; (3) emotional involvement in relationships runs counter to continued condom use; the decision to curtail condom use is made quickly; and (4) relationships in which condoms are not used are multiple, overlapping and sequential. The result is a high level of risk for STD. This risk is not random or meaningless; it is conditioned by socioeconomic factors that press participants to focus on shortterm pleasure and emotional and material gains rather than on long-term planning and monogamous partnerships. It is, in short, a rational response to social disparity. The results of our investigation, however, lead us towards pessimistic conclusions regarding STD prevention and risk reduction behaviors with current methods.

Higher rates of seropositivity were observed in African Americans, smokers, and individuals of low socioeconomic status. All three of these risk factors have been previously shown to render individuals more prone to a variety of respiratory illnesses (2, 5, 11). The demographic factor as- sociations were particularly evident in individuals with higher antibody titers, suggesting that these risk factors are linked to recent infections. Similarly, higher antibody levels were significantly associated with the season of the blood draw, and the highest coronavirus immunoreactivity occurred during the summer months. It is possible that in this population of adults and especially in those individuals deemed at risk, these summer bouts could represent either a persistent infection or a reinfection with the same coronavirus strain (1). Amino acid identity among the four coronavirus nucleocapsids is overall generally low (35.4 to 68.2%), thus making the nucleocapsid protein a useful strain-specific diagnostic antigen (8) . Nevertheless, defining the extent of the cross-reactivity among the coronavirus nucleocapsids remains an ongoing issue. Recent results regarding the degree of cross-reactivity between the SARS nucleocapsids and each of the non-SARS nucleocapsids (8, 12) are mixed, and in these studies, it was not possible to assess the degree of cross-reactivity among the non-SARS strains. Our study was not designed specifically to test cross-reactivity; however, the correlation between the antibody levels of different strains was evident, with the expected highest association observed between viruses within the same phylogenetic group (i.e., between NL63 and 229E [group I] and between OC43 and HKU1 [group II]). The cross-reactivity between group I strains has previously been suggested in a serological study of NL63 and 229E in children and young adults (17) . In this study, portions of the nucleocapsid genes were expressed and certain amino acid regions of the NL63 recombinant proteins were detected by 229E antisera in Western blots. Although our use of the whole nucleocapsid sequence may have contributed to a certain degree of crossreactivity, the absence of reactivity to the feline coronavirus nucleocapsid indicates that genus-and group-specific crossreactivity cannot completely explain the correlation between antibody levels to the different human coronavirus strains. Because the feline virus is more closely related to NL63 and 229E than to OC43 and HKU1, the correlation observed between the group I and group II coronaviruses is likely to reflect a shared exposure rather than cross-reactivity. In our study, we also have evidence for intragroup monospecificity of individual strains. For example, 32% of the 196 individuals who were seropositive for OC43 were seronegative for HKU1. With re- spect to the group I viruses, 5.6% of individuals were seropositive for either NL63 or 229E but not for both. The extent of the cross-reactivity to the nucleocapsid proteins of human coronaviruses will need to be addressed in future studies by competitive inhibition experiments with purified nucleocapsid proteins. Documenting relative levels of seroprevalence of coronavirus strains is important, particularly given the recent emergence of the SARS virus as a serious pathogen. The assay that we have developed is a straightforward and sensitive means of tracking the four known human non-SARS coronaviruses, and its application will likely benefit epidemiological studies of these viruses.",21.360542401399698,8.548465134853393

Most affected patients are considered 'gainers and growers' who, prior to the onset of NEC, had few if any manifestations of gastrointestinal dysfunction, and few apparent sequelae of the previous diseases of prematurity from which they had been recovering. 12 In many but not all instances, the affected pre-term infants had respiratory distress syndrome days to weeks before the onset of NEC. With the advent of surfactant therapy for respiratory distress syndrome, more infants may survive this disorder and are now at risk for NEC during their convalescence. 12 Because NEC is seen in premature infants, many factors associated with prematurity were thought to be risk factors for NEC. These were related to diseases, procedures or complications that may produce gastrointestinal ischemia, infection or altered digestion. Mucosal injury following a combination of these risk factors was thought to produce NEC. Ischemic risk factors included birth asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxia, hypotension, patent ductus arteriosus, polycythemia, anemia, umbilical artery, catheter placement and exchange transfusion. Because these risk factors were identified as part of a profile among affected infants, they were thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC. Although each may contribute to mucosal injury, case-control studies suggest that these processes are equally prevalent among affected patients and unaffected controls. 1 Therefore, these risk factors merely describe the low-birthweight population and are no longer thought to be direct contributing factors in the pathogenesis of NEC (see below).

Canadians of lower socioeconomic status are known to have a higher prevalence of various cardiovascular disease risk factors. 49 62 Recent studies have reaffirmed the role of these risk factors for IHD. 63 64 For medical care, the Polypill may substantially reduce IHD 65 and if socioeconomic groups were to adhere equally to the recommendations, income-related IHD disparities could diminish as well. However, it should be noted that differentials in Polypill use and adherence might lead to an increased income-related IHD mortality disparity. Studies conducted by Alter et al 5 66 and Kapral et al 6 have shown that Ontarians from lower income neighbourhoods were less likely to receive specialised health services for acute myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. However, in both studies, lower income was shown to be associated with mortality independent of medical service characteristics, suggesting that patients of lower socioeconomic status experience greater disease severity owing to factors stemming from outside the medical care setting as well.",21.96211935354215,8.144234147996006

Stakeholders were approached to involve in all steps of the study. The setting of the study was in Mugdhaharn Province, Thailand. The conceptual framework of the risk communication was developed from literature review comprising two major components: 1) risk assessment and 2) risk management. In relation to risk assessment, qualitative and quantitative techniques were applied. The target groups of risk assessment were people at risk of diabetes mellitus, family members, and related persons. The issues to be assessed covered risk factors, risk perception, strengths and weaknesses of self care and risk contexts. The results of the risk assessment led to the guidelines and strategies for coping with the risk factors. Regarding the risk management, the guideline and strategies were initially implemented by focusing on the engagement of the stakeholders which resulted in learning and better understanding among related people. The proposed model reflecting two significant components and its process was accepted by stakeholders and further implemented by local health care team in the study area.

The purpose of this study was to develop CBT for older adults with depression which fit in with Japanese culture and research its effectiveness in outpatient care. By randomized clinical trial recruiting, 15 older adults were chosen. All the participants had a diagnosis of Major depression. The participants were randomly allocated to receive either Treatment as usual (TAU) group (n=10) or CBT group (n=5). We assessed the degree of depression before the treatments (baseline), at the 6th week and at the 12th week. Measures used in this study were the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Geriatric Depression Scale Japanese version (GDS), and the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale for Depression -Japanese (MADRS-J).In CBT intervention, the psychoeducation about the typical cognitive characteristics of older adults' depression and the reminiscence based hearing of subjects' compliant were conducted in addition to basic CBT strategy. The results suggested that the score of SDS was significantly decreased in both CBT group and TAU group at 12th week (CBT; SDS baseline M=54.4, 12th week M=40.6, TAU; SDS baseline M= 58.5, 12th week M=46.7). The CBT developed in the present study was effective for improving depressive symptoms. However, the difference between CBT group and TAU group in the score of depression was nonsignificant. The results of GDS and MADRS-J showed the same tendency as SDS(CBT; GDS baseline M=10.8, 12th week M=8.6, MADRS-J baseline M=24.8, 12th week M=11.2, TAU; GDS baseline M=11.4, 12th week M=9.7, MADRS-J baseline M=25.2, 12th week M=10.6). The limitation of this study is that the number of CBT session, which was 6, might have not been enough to get the result which would make the differentiate it from TAU. Since CBT alone was effective for the patients to whom the medication of antidepressant had been stopped, the effectiveness of this treatment has been suggested. Future studies need long-term intervention of CBT in a large number of participants. The UNC Alumni Heart Study started in 1986 with data from college entry in 1964-66.

It is important to distinguish between ecological and individual-level risk factors in order to direct interventions appropriately. Here we extended our analysis to assess individual risk factors for colonization among residents without history of CRKP carriage. Methods: A point-prevalence study was conducted in 12 PACFs.

The decision to admit to hospital is influenced by many different medical and social factors. In addition, because of difficulties in diagnostic criteria for bronchiolitis, some studies have examined admission rates with RSV infection as opposed to diagnosis of bronchiolitis as such. There are few population based studies although one recent large retrospective population study from the US examined the epidemiological features of incident bronchiolitis among 93 058 singleton births. 33 Many risk factors cannot be modified and these include age, gender and underlying medical conditions. Infants with older siblings have an increased risk of acquiring viral infections and are more likely to be admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis. 33 Males have an increased risk of bronchiolitis and also more severe disease with hospital admission which may be related to airway mechanics and having relatively smaller airways compared with females. 33 There is an increased risk of wheezing illness following RSV bronchiolitis although there is no convincing evidence of association with personal or family history of atopy and bronchiolitis. 34 Epidemiological studies from New Zealand, Australia and also USA have shown an association between ethnic background and risk of both bronchiolitis and more severe disease with admission to hospital for indigenous infants of Aboriginal, 35 Maori 36 or First Nation background. 33 Younger infants are more likely to be admitted to hospital than older infants with bronchiolitis and thus timing of birth in relation to the RSV season will affect the risk of requiring admission to hospital with RSV. Infants born prematurely ( 36 weeks gestation) are at increased risk for more severe disease and hospital admission with bronchiolitis. The risks of hospital admission with RSV infection were associated with gestational age in a study from Finland which reported a higher relative risk (RR) for hospital admission for infants born under 32 weeks gestation (RR 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.7-4.8) although the relative risk was still increased for infants born between 32-35 weeks gestation (RR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-2.6). 37 Pre-existing disease increases the risk of death in infants with RSV infection. 5 Infants with chronic neonatal lung disease born under 32 weeks gestation have an increased risk of severe disease with RSV infection and admission to hospital with a hospital admission rate reported in one series of 19%, 38 and infants with underlying congenital anomalies 33 or chronic lung disease such as cystic fibrosis even born at term also have increased risk for more severe disease and admission to hospital. Infants with congenital heart disease have a higher risk of severe disease with RSV infection and account for around 6.4% of admissions in some cohort studies. 39 There are also risk factors that may be modified and these include exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, socioeconomic factors and protective factors such as breast feeding. Parental smoking is a recognized risk factor for hospital admission with bronchiolitis. There is some evidence to suggest both in utero exposure to tobacco from maternal smoking 33 and postnatal exposure are associated with an increased risk of hospital admission for bronchiolitis. 40 Poor socioeconomic factors, such as overcrowding and bedroom sharing may be associated with increased risk of transmission of respiratory viral infections are associated with an increased risk of admission with RSV infection. 41 In one small case control study the risk of hospital admission with bronchiolitis increased with socioeconomic deprivation score. 42 In a large epidemiological study, infants of mothers under 20 years of age had an increased risk of admission with bronchiolitis. 33 ",20.592595791345126,11.001278534962584

The role of psychosocial factors, or ''stress,'' has undergone an important re-evaluation both in terms of a disease risk factor and a concomitant component of severity. Evidence has shown that parental stress is a risk factor for asthma expression in some children. 90 The mechanisms by which this occurs have not been defined but might include the promotion of allergic inflammation. For example, Liu et al 91 found stress from final examinations to enhance eosinophil recruitment to the airway after an antigen inhalation challenge. Chen et al 92 evaluated the influence of socioeconomic status, which they related to stress, on cytokine generation. With peripheral blood cells from asthmatic subjects but not healthy control subjects, lower socioeconomic status was associated with greater generation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-5 and IL-13. These data are a further indication that stress can, in asthmatic subjects, promote an inflammatory profile.

Personal characteristics, such as neuroticism, may put people at greater risk for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Neuroticism includes greater vulnerability to negative emotions, irrational ideas associated with distress, and difficulty controlling impulses and coping with stress. 11 Positive characteristics, such as optimism and resilience, may provide protection against emotional distress and may even foster positive outcomes. 12 Spirituality and religion also may promote better psychological functioning in the context of stress. 13 Social relationships also may be important. Social support may be a protective factor, and social strain may be a risk factor for emotional distress. 8 Although predictors of emotional responses have been identified, less is known about the factors that may predict behavior. This is unfortunate because, as was apparent after hurricane Katrina, the behavior of citizens may have a large, immediate, and direct impact on the greater public health. 9 Whereas little research has examined predictors of behavior directly, a logical place to start may be to examine the effects of predictors of emotional responses, because of the strong potential relationship between emotional and behavioral responses. Emotions have been characterized as ''action tendencies,'' and there is both theory and empirical evidence to suggest that emotional distress may be linked to important behaviors in traumatic situations. [14] [15] [16] The purpose of the present study was to explore the anticipated emotional and behavioral responses to an avian flu outbreak. Lau et al 5 studied the anticipated responses of Chinese adults in Hong Kong to an avian flu outbreak and found that most people anticipated emotional distress or changes in behavior. Our goal was to build on that work in several ways. First, we examined anticipated responses in a US sample farther removed from a potential outbreak and less primed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Second, we expanded the psychological responses to include positive and negative emotions and the behavioral responses to include helping, sacrificial, avoidant, and illegal behaviors.

Most SSI were superficial (75%), but 9% involved bone or joint. The multivariable regression analysis identified age group, trauma, duration of operation and ASA score as significant independent risk factors for SSI. When these factors were taken into account, type of arthroplasty was not a significant predictor of risk of SSI. After allowing for these factors there was still significant interhospital variation in rates of SSI, which was still evident when the length of post-operative stay was taken into account. Patients undergoing hemarthroplasty are older, have higher ASA scores and are more likely to have surgery as a result of trauma. The variation in incidence of SSI following hip arthroplasty is more likely to be explained by these characteristics than the type of procedure. The variation in incidence of SSI between hospitals is not fully explained by case-mix, but comparisons of rates should take into account significant risk factors. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen in SSI of hip arthroplasty, especially in patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty.

A survey of hospitalizations associated with a pneumonia ICD-9-CM code reported in Medicare claims [3] found a significantly higher risk among men than among women, as did a follow-up assessment of the risk of a hospitalization associated with a pneumonia diagnosis among participants of the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHA-NES I) [17] . Neither of these studies assessed whether male sex was associated with pneumonia after adjusting for other risk factors, so it was not clear in these studies whether male sex was simply a marker for a higher prevalence of other risk factors. A population-based study involving 4175 elderly persons in Finland found that crude CAP rates did not differ between men and women and that male sex was not significantly associated with CAP after accounting for age and certain chronic medical conditions and risk factors, including asthma, receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, and heart disease [21] . Because our study population was much larger than that of the Finnish study, we have more power to detect an independent risk of CAP associated with male sex if such a risk truly exists.

Over the last decade HCAP has been used to describe the entity wherein patients develop pneumonia outside the hospital yet have pathogens usually associated with HAP or VAP, such as MDR gram-negative bacilli and MRSA. Criteria for HCAP and the resultant number of patients who should get broad-spectrum empirical therapy remain subject to debate. Using any risk factor for drug-resistant pathogens (DRP) leads to antibiotic overtreatment, while ignoring risk factors is associated with undertreatment and adverse outcomes [5] . In a prospective observational study, Shindo et al. found six independent risk factors for pathogens resistant to the usual CAP antibiotics: (1) hospitalization ≥ 2 days during the previous 90 days, (2) antibiotic use during the previous 90 days, (3) non-ambulatory status, (4) tube feedings, (5) immunocompromised status, and (6) use of gastric acid suppression medications [17] . Presence of three or more risk factors should prompt a physician to consider broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, as the frequency of drug resistant pathogens may be as high as 43 %. These criteria work equally well as the previous definition of HCAP, and a strategy for initial antibiotic selection based on these risk factors may result in far less empirical broad-spectrum therapy while still identifying the majority who need it.",19.696393617277934,11.063179036875525

The incidence of PTLD ranged from 0.2% in patients with no risk factors to more than 8% with more than 3 risk factors [49] .

Clinical presentation varies and could range from asymptomatic to fulminant tumor lysis syndrome. CT scans of the chest are notable for multiple pulmonary nodules with basal and peripheral predominance, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, patchy consolidation, pleural effusion, and chest wall or pleural-based masses [70] . Diagnosis may require a biopsy or could be made via noninvasive methods in the appropriate clinical setting. A probable diagnosis is made by increased EBV DNA levels in the setting of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly and when other causes have been ruled out, proven disease requires a biopsy.

To understand the conditions that enable pathogens to spill over from bats to other species, we need to understand the mechanisms driving pathogen dynamics within and among bat hosts. Pathogen spillover events are often associated with sharp increases, or pulses, in pathogen prevalence that vary in amplitude and timing [4] [5] [6] , but the mechanisms driving these pulses are unknown. Therefore, characterizing pulse variation across space and time, and identifying biotic and climatic factors associated with these pulses, will enhance our ability to predict and manage spillover [1, 7, 8] .

Amongst the range of factors and mechanisms that are shown to alter the developmental trajectories, the association of certain risk factors/mechanisms remain weak and needs to be replicated. Various risk factors seem to mediate a large number of mechanisms that impair crucial phases of fetal development and result in a similar set of behavioral outcomes in the offspring. It is essential to classify the risk factors that confer predominant risk and delineate their mechanistic basis. The current understanding suggests that developmental modulation during embryogenesis by various factors and mechanisms could potentially predict behavioral outcomes in the offspring during adolescence or early adulthood and these precede the onset of illness. Early onset schizophrenia is a severe form of schizophrenia that occurs during childhood or adolescence and is often chronic and persistently debilitating. However, the frequency of early onset schizophrenia has been reported to be around 4% (Cannon et al., 1999) . Although converging functional genomics suggests involvement of multiple genes in neurodevelopment, certain genes are found to confer susceptibility to various neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, most of the risk genes have a variable pattern of expression and different effects at different developmental stages. Some of the genes exhibit preferential expression in the fetal brain and high gene expression occurring during fetal development can be reversed in early postnatal life (Colantuoni et al., 2011) . In addition, progressive brain changes have also been reported in chronic adult patients with schizophrenia (Chan et al., 2011b) . Therefore, it is important to study the effect of various risk factors including genes as well as neuroprogressive changes at different time points during the lifespan to gain more insights on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia rather than focussing emphatically on neurodevelopmental insults. The developmental neuroinflammation has also been contradicted by a recent study where neonates who later developed schizophrenia had unaltered levels of 17 inflammatory markers, thus refuting an association between neonatal inflammation and risk of schizophrenia (Nielsen et al., 2014) .",23.327653004559785,8.879351905327557

For example, following two cases of MERS that were diagnosed in healthcare workers from Saudi Arabia traveling to the United States, CDC altered its guidance to emphasize testing for MERS in persons with mild symptoms but with strong epidemiologic risk factors, including particularly prior healthcare exposure [13] . In addition, travel to selected countries or regions may also be included or excluded as a risk factor for disease as an outbreak evolves.

The estimation strategy for risk factors involved a counterfactual approach that quantifies the level of exposure to the risk factor in a population and the relative risk of LRI given exposure. Typically, the exposure in a population is modelled on the basis of surveys and scientific literature and the risk of LRI is derived from published metaanalyses. Childhood growth failure risks were estimated as a continuous exposure of the height or weight Z scores. Likewise, air pollution was considered a continuous exposure of the amount of fine particulate matter smaller than 2·5 μm in diameter. Other risk factors, such as low vaccine coverage, are modelled when the exposure is a population prevalence of being exposed to that risk factor (eg, the population prevalence of being unvaccinated for low vaccine coverage). Descriptions of the riskfactor exposure models and relative risks are provided in the appendix (pp 13-66). Risk factors in GBD are part of a comparative risk assessment framework and are modelled independently. 8 Therefore, in our study, the burden associated with each risk factor can be considered as the LRI mortality that could be averted if exposure to that risk factor was eliminated. Since they were modelled independently, our analysis does not quantify the potential impact of combined interventions and combining riskfactor burden by summing risk factors is not appropriate and could lead to greater attribution than disease burden.",21.422964863624525,9.015205613202077

A genetic risk factor for intravascular coagulation may not, by itself, provide an answer. Although the prevalence of coagulation abnormalities in patients with GC-induced ON is increased in some studies compared to controls [9, 10, [53] [54] [55] , a considerable proportion of ON patients does not demonstrate an increased prevalence for thrombophilic disorders [56, 57] . Furthermore, not all patients with both GC usage and thrombophilic factors develop ON [33] . Likewise, although alcoholism is associated with ON as an etiological factor, not all heavy alcohol users develop the disease. Therefore, it is difficult to say whether ON that occurs in patients with an underlying or predisposing factor, is actually due to the underlying disease or risk factor rather than GC treatment or alcohol. Many of the patients with predisposing factors or underlying diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or acute leukemia, also have been administered GC as part of their treatment regimen. Similarly, while most therapeutic regimens in oncology include steroids as part of the protocol or as an adjunctive measure in the control of nausea and/or prophylaxis against hypersensitivity reactions, cases of ON developing after chemotherapy (with or without steroids) or radiation therapy have been well described in the oncology literature [93] [94] [95] . As well, several investigators have reported ON developing in patients before GCs or replacement treatment regimen take place [6, [96] [97] [98] .

Specialized laboratories can use more complex techniques that, generally, prove to be more sensitive and specific, but are also more expensive and difficult. Nevertheless, many of the coprocultures a standard laboratory requests and examines are negative. A negative result can be the consequence of the following reasons: diarrhea is not actually infectious, it is caused by an agent for which the laboratory has no data, there is a failure in the test sensitivity, the patient may have taken antibiotics, or there may have been problems in fecal transport. Cases that have returned negative results are a mixture of etiologies, and for that reason further investigation makes little sense. In the EDICS study (Study of Infectious Diarrhea in Castellón) of risk factors in infantile diarrhea, no risk factors were found associated to the cases with a negative fecal analysis result. On the contrary, risk factors were found in cases of campylobacteriosis, salmonelosis, or rotavirus. This indeed suggests that the group of negatives is a mixture of different etiological cases without common origin and with few shared risk factors.

Statistical models can be constructed to assist in the case detection process by estimating the probability that a patient is a suspect, probable or confirmed case, based on various criteria such as identification factors (e.g. readmission to hospital for therapy of SSI), risk factors (e.g. old age, or prolonged operative time) (Figure 3) and clinical findings (i.e. lab order, lab result, imaging, procedures, drug order, etc.) [9] . Fig. 3 . The general overview of the Trigger factors taxonomy (visualized using OntoGraph 5 ). The identification factors, which are usually identified after the development of HAI, can be used to identify confirmed cases, and risk factors can be used to infer the status of patients as a suspect or probable case. When infection control programs use risk factors, or identification factors, to trigger surveillance activities, they are referred to as trigger factors [9] .",16.698320124026225,7.484058764295409

Specialized laboratories can use more complex techniques that, generally, prove to be more sensitive and specific, but are also more expensive and difficult. Nevertheless, many of the coprocultures a standard laboratory requests and examines are negative. A negative result can be the consequence of the following reasons: diarrhea is not actually infectious, it is caused by an agent for which the laboratory has no data, there is a failure in the test sensitivity, the patient may have taken antibiotics, or there may have been problems in fecal transport. Cases that have returned negative results are a mixture of etiologies, and for that reason further investigation makes little sense. In the EDICS study (Study of Infectious Diarrhea in Castellón) of risk factors in infantile diarrhea, no risk factors were found associated to the cases with a negative fecal analysis result. On the contrary, risk factors were found in cases of campylobacteriosis, salmonelosis, or rotavirus. This indeed suggests that the group of negatives is a mixture of different etiological cases without common origin and with few shared risk factors. The appearance of vomit as an initial symptom, the absence of fecal blood (macro-or microscopic,) and low PCR (reactive C protein) are signs suggestive of viral etiology, especially in children.",19.04801583593433,9.556869644988286

In other settings, geographic factors, ethnic origin, or gender can be important determinants of inequity. Simple methods are needed to enable countries to decide which factors are most important for them, and to monitor inequities in health, education, and other areas by monitoring one or more of the key determinants, as interventions are being implemented. Monitoring of inequities in both opportunities and outcomes will enable countries to understand whether existing or future programmes are reducing or indeed increasing inequity. For example, in some countries, a detailed analysis of factors associated with child mortality would likely show that, although socioeconomic factors have a role, with low risk recorded in the wealthiest quintile, a more important determinant of mortality risk is living in an area with no eff ective health services. On the basis of such an analysis, the government might then elect to monitor intervention coverage and mortality in a representative sample of such areas to ensure that as mortality is reduced nationally, the equity gap between the highest risk and lowest risk groups is also narrowed.

The risk factors including hospitalisation (OR:3,1; 1,19−8,1; p:0,018), co-morbidity (OR:2,1; 1,12−7,3, p:0,024), were found higher in ESBL (+) group compared to ESBL(−) group. Hospitalisation at last three months was found as a risk factor for resistance to any 3rd generation cephalosporins (OR:2,4; 0,9−6,3; p:0,04). There was a correlation between ESBL (+) production and resistant to many antibiotics that are generally used for ampiric treatment (p < 0,05, Pearson correlation r: 0,78), except for piperacillintazobactam (p > 0,05). ESBL production was significantly higher in K. pneumoniae (p: 0,0005), E. cloacae (p:0,001), E. sakazakii (p:0,001) and A. baumannii (p:0,005) strains more than other Gram negative strains revealed in Table- 1. Hospitalisation was single significant risk factor for patients with MRSA (OR:1,8, 0,7−1,2, p:0,005; Table-1) . Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus was not isolated. Discussion: Hospitalisation and co-morbidity causing to colonisation and impairment on immunity are the most important risk factors for ESBL producing microorganisms related infections as our study revealed. Although antibiotic usage including 2nd, 3rd generation cephalosporins and quinolones was cited as a risk factor for ESBL related infections, it was not found significant statistically in our study. Piperacillin-tazobactam could be thought as an option to treat the resistant Gram negative infections associated with K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. sakazakii and A. baumannii whose ESBL rates are frequently higher in our local settings but carbapenems, should be opted for serious patients with co-morbidites. Consequently, immunity and infection control programs are important factors against increasing antibiotic resistance rates. Objective: Infections in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are associated with prolonged hospitalisation and adverse outcomes.

Higher rates of seropositivity were observed in African Americans, smokers, and individuals of low socioeconomic status. All three of these risk factors have been previously shown to render individuals more prone to a variety of respiratory illnesses (2, 5, 11). The demographic factor as- sociations were particularly evident in individuals with higher antibody titers, suggesting that these risk factors are linked to recent infections. Similarly, higher antibody levels were significantly associated with the season of the blood draw, and the highest coronavirus immunoreactivity occurred during the summer months. It is possible that in this population of adults and especially in those individuals deemed at risk, these summer bouts could represent either a persistent infection or a reinfection with the same coronavirus strain (1). Amino acid identity among the four coronavirus nucleocapsids is overall generally low (35.4 to 68.2%), thus making the nucleocapsid protein a useful strain-specific diagnostic antigen (8) . Nevertheless, defining the extent of the cross-reactivity among the coronavirus nucleocapsids remains an ongoing issue. Recent results regarding the degree of cross-reactivity between the SARS nucleocapsids and each of the non-SARS nucleocapsids (8, 12) are mixed, and in these studies, it was not possible to assess the degree of cross-reactivity among the non-SARS strains. Our study was not designed specifically to test cross-reactivity; however, the correlation between the antibody levels of different strains was evident, with the expected highest association observed between viruses within the same phylogenetic group (i.e., between NL63 and 229E [group I] and between OC43 and HKU1 [group II]). The cross-reactivity between group I strains has previously been suggested in a serological study of NL63 and 229E in children and young adults (17) . In this study, portions of the nucleocapsid genes were expressed and certain amino acid regions of the NL63 recombinant proteins were detected by 229E antisera in Western blots. Although our use of the whole nucleocapsid sequence may have contributed to a certain degree of crossreactivity, the absence of reactivity to the feline coronavirus nucleocapsid indicates that genus-and group-specific crossreactivity cannot completely explain the correlation between antibody levels to the different human coronavirus strains. Because the feline virus is more closely related to NL63 and 229E than to OC43 and HKU1, the correlation observed between the group I and group II coronaviruses is likely to reflect a shared exposure rather than cross-reactivity. In our study, we also have evidence for intragroup monospecificity of individual strains. For example, 32% of the 196 individuals who were seropositive for OC43 were seronegative for HKU1. With re- spect to the group I viruses, 5.6% of individuals were seropositive for either NL63 or 229E but not for both. The extent of the cross-reactivity to the nucleocapsid proteins of human coronaviruses will need to be addressed in future studies by competitive inhibition experiments with purified nucleocapsid proteins. Documenting relative levels of seroprevalence of coronavirus strains is important, particularly given the recent emergence of the SARS virus as a serious pathogen. The assay that we have developed is a straightforward and sensitive means of tracking the four known human non-SARS coronaviruses, and its application will likely benefit epidemiological studies of these viruses.",20.197141584606104,8.141274848975634

Bunton et al. (1977) systematically used the case control method to compare affected infants with infants admitted just before and after the cases. Asphyxia and catheter related problems were significantly related to a risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. However, these authors observed that colitis did not develop until an average of 13 days after the umbilical artery catheters had been removed and the range was 2-29 days. Such an extended delay between catheter removal and development of symptoms vitiates any aetiological association. Stoll et al. (1980) also used a case control method but found none of the maternal and infant risk factors significantly associated. Kliegman et al. (19823) compared clinical findings and risk factors in patients with the entire population of low birth weight infants admitted to the unit. Only placentia abruptio was significantly more frequent among the cases of NNEC. However, it was found in only 19% of the cases as opposed to 8% of the controls. Thus, if we accept the view that necrotizing enterocolitis is a clinical entity, placentia abruptio cannot be its cause. It is worth pointing out that there is a substantial chance of finding a single factor significantly associated with NNEC if enough factors are tested for simply on the basis of chance. Indeed, it is clear that no single risk factor can possibly be incriminated as a common aetiology in NNEC. Prematurity is not even a universal factor. Tait & Kealy (1979) described five cases in full-term infants at Kingston Hospital. Two of these infants had no associated risk factors, one weighing 3.7 kg and the other 4.1 kg at birth. Each of them had an apgar score at 1 min of 9. A reasonable conclusion to draw from the efforts to associate various risk factors with NNEC is that risk factors describe the patient population in which these infants are found and do not indicate the aetiology of NNEC. (1983) there is evidence of significant year to year variation (Table I) . These series represent an average number of cases per year of between 11 and 28.

Although numerous risk factors related to the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea have been identified, they can all be categorized into those that are related to the calf, the pathogens involved, or the environment of the calf. The immune status of calves, specifically the level of passively acquired immunity through colostrum, is the major risk factor related to the calf and the occurrence of diarrhea. Although numerous pathogens have been implicated in the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea, only a relatively limited number are commonly involved. Most should be viewed as secondary opportunists rather than primary pathogens, because none are extraordinarily virulent, and with the exception of Salmonella spp., most are present within the gastrointestinal tract of many healthy, mature cattle. Important risk factors related to pathogens involved in neonatal calf diarrhea involve the size of the inoculum and the occurrence of multiple infections. Finally, when considering the environment and housing conditions in which beef and dairy calves may reside, it is clear that tremendous variations exist.

The spatial coordinates of cases can be overlaid on satellite imagery to demonstrate relationships with environmental features-such as bodies of water-and formally analyzed using spatial statistical techniques. Satellite sensors that detect reflected visible or infrared radiation provide additional information on temperature, rainfall, humidity, and vegetation among other variables, which are particularly important for the transmission dynamics of vector-borne viral infections. Satellite data for epidemiologic analyses are provided by a number of sources such as: (1) earth-observing satellites with high spatial resolution (1-4 m) but low repeat frequencies such as Ikonos and Landsat satellites; (2) oceanographic and atmospheric satellites such as MODIS and ASTER with lower spatial resolution (0.25-1 km) that provide images of the Earth surface twice a day; and (3) geostationary weather satellites such as GEOS with large spatial resolution (1-8 km). The statistical relationships between cases and environmental risk factors can be used to construct risk maps. Risk maps display the similarity of environmental features in unsampled locations to environmental features in locations where the disease is measured to be present or absent. Spatial analysis of the initial cases of West Nile virus infection in New York City in 1999 identified a significant spatial cluster (Brownstein, 2002) .

Results: Forty six cases were diagnosed as EPT during the 2 year period. Twenty two were males (47.8%) and 24 females (52.2%). The mean age of the patients was 50.6 years (range, 17-80 years). Of the 46 patients, tuberculous lymphadenitis was diagnosid in 18 (39.1%), genitourinary system tuberculous in 8 (17.3%), Pott's disease in 7 (15.2%), miliary tuberculosis in 3 (6.5%), peritonitis tuberculous in 1 (2.1%), skin tuberculosis in 1 (2.1%), bone tuberculosis in 1 (2.1%), and joint tuberculosis in 1 (2.1%). Symptoms were usually non-specific, and related to the site of infection. The most common symptoms were fever (20/46, 43.4%), fatigue (15/46, 32.6%). Concurrent disease, previous history of tuberculosis and a history of contact with an infected patient were determined to be the major risk factors for EPT. Of all patients, 11 (23.9%) had a previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis, 8 had chronic renal failure (17.3%), and diabetes mellitü s 5 (10.8%). EPT was diagnosed by histopathologic methods in 27 (57.8%) and by microbiologic methods in 13 (28.2%) of the patients. In six of the cases, and cultures grew no bacteria EPT was diagnosed by the helps of clinical, laboratory, imaging, and/or histopathological studies. Surgery was required in 5 patients; 2 had tuberculous lymphadenitis, 2 had Pott's disease, and 1 had tuberculous osteomyelitis. In our study, 3 of the patients (6.5%) died one had miliary tuberculosis, and 2 patients had tuberculous meningitis. Conclusion: Physicians should be aware of unusual presentations and localizations of tuberculosis and should consider EPT in the differential diagnosis of any patient with non-specific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, night sweat, low-back pain, and weight loss.",8.917386716249464,6.614283185179042

In Taiwan, diabetes mellitus has emerged as an overwhelming risk factor for PLA, whereas epidemiologic studies on diabetes as a risk factor for PLA in Western populations are sparse. Methods: We examined diabetes as a risk factor and prognostic factor for PLA in Denmark during a 26-year period, using a large nationwide data set based on administrative registries. We identified all patients with a diagnosis of PLA in the National Registry of Patients, and randomly selected fifty gender-and age-matched population controls for each case. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for PLA according to diabetes, adjusted for medical and surgical risk factors. Among patients with PLA, we compared adjusted mortality odds ratios in diabetic and other patients. Results: The study included 1448 patients with a first hospitalisation with PLA between 1977 and 2003. The median age (range) was 65 (0-97) years, and 54% were men. A total of 11.1% of the patients with PLA had diabetes recorded before or on the matching date, compared with 2.5% of control subjects. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the OR for PLA in persons with diabetes was 4.0 (95% CI: 3.3-4.8). At 30 days after discharge, the mortality was 24.8% for diabetic patients and 18.0% for non-diabetic patients with PLA. The adjusted mortality odds ratio in diabetic patients was 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.9). Conclusion: In this nationwide study, we found a fourfold increased risk and a poorer outcome of PLA associated with diabetes mellitus. Objective: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a major complication of liver cirrhosis. There are few data about prognostic significance of bacteremia in patients with SBP. So we performed a retrospective study to determine the influence of bacteremia on the mortality of patients with SBP. Methods: All patients with SBP, in whom the microorganism was isolated from ascites and/or blood, were identified by retrospective review of clinical and laboratory records in Seoul National University Hospital in Korea from January 2002 to December 2004. They were classified into the bacteremic group and non-bacteremic group. The underlying liver function was determined by MELD (Model for End-stage Liver disease) score. Microbiologic response rate, ascites polymorphonuclear leukocyte count reduction rate, and SBP-related mortality were compared between the two groups. To identify the independent risk factors of mortality, a multiple logistic regression model was used to control for the effects of confounding variables. Results: A total of 203 patients were enrolled in this study. Among 203 patients, 116 (57.1%) were bacteremic, and 87 (42.9%) non-bacteremic. Escherichia coli was the most common etiologic organism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The distribution of etiologic organisms was not different between the two groups. Stratified MELD scores showed no significant difference between the two groups. Microbiologic response rate (64.7% versus 74.7%, p > 0.05), and ascites polymorphonuclear leukocyte count reduction rate (34.3% versus 43.3%, p > 0.05) were not different between bacteremic and non-bacteremic group. But SBP-related mortality of bacteremic groups was significantly higher than that of non-bacteremic group (31% versus 8%, p < 0.001).Bacteremia (OR, 5.8; 95% CI. 1.9-16.9; p < 0.01) and MELD score (OR, 2.4; 95% CI. 1.1-5.1; p = 0.017) were independent risk factors in multiple logistic regression analyses of SBP related mortality. Conclusion: Bacteremia is an independent risk factor of mortality in SBP. Objective: Etiological analysis of sputum culture regarding seasonal fluctuations in family practitioners' patients. Methods: The study group included both primary care (207) and clinically diagnosed patients (50) who had their sputum examination ordered and then performed in Silesian Analytic Laboratories in the2000-05 period. All subjects were registered in the family practise or hospitalised in the Silesian area. The including criteria were active infections of lower respiratory tract. The intake, transport and final identification of the material complied with laboratory standards. Results: Number of positive cultures of all sputum samples taken from both primary care and hospitalised patients accounted for 77% and 68%, respectively. The most common pathogens of primary care patients were, in order of prevalence (excluding Streptococcus viridans): Moraxella catarrhalis (57%), E.coli 21%, Staph.aureus 11%, Klebs.pneumoniae 10%, Pseud. Aeruginosa 6%, Proteus mirabilis 4%. In clinically diagnosed patients these were: Moraxella catarrhalis 33%, Klebs. pneum. 22%, E coli 19%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 19%, Staph.aureus 11%, Str. spp. 11%, Str. pneumonicae 7%. As for any seasonal fluctuations among primary care patients the higher number of positive samples was noted in April and October (15%), the least in June, July and August (3%).The results of our detailed analysis of primary care samples showed the higher percentage of Moraxella catarrhalis strains in Dec. (77%) and Jan.(75%) and the least in May (20%). In the other months it ranged from 50 to 60%. The higher percentage of E.coli isolates (70%) was observed in May, while in Mar., Jun. and Dec. they were absent. As for Staphylococcus aureus the most frequent detection was stated in Mar. and Dec.27% and 31%, respectively), whereas they did not emerge in summer months (from June to Sep.). The higher emergence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in June (20%) while Klebs. pneumoniae isolates tested positively mainly during the spring and summer period (10-20%).",8.398227006900882,6.583317695804438

The purpose of this study was to survey the incidence and the site of infection and to define risk factors for infection and mortality in ICU admittedmultiple trauma patients. Methods: Prospective record for APACHE II score day by day was conducted for all multiple trauma patients who were admitted at surgical ICU of Ajou university hospital from June 1. 2002 1. to May 30. 2004 . Patients who were transferred from other hospitals after operation, or for more than 48 hours care or under the age of 18 were excluded. We reviewed medical records and all imaging studies retrospectively. Results: A total of 108 patients (81 males) with mean age of 41 years (± 14 years) were included and their mean APACHE II score was 27.5 (± 18.9). Most common cause of trauma was blunt injuries (83 patients, 76.9 %) like traffic accidents and fall down. A total of 60 infections had occurred in 44 (40.7%) patients for an incidence of 12.5/1000 patient-days. The sites of infection were lower respiratory tract (22%), skin/soft tissue (11%), intraabdomen (5.6%), central venous catheter (5.6%), urinary tract (2.8%), surgical site (2.8%) and others (11%). Mean onset time of infection was 25 days (± 41 days) and mean onset time according to infection sites were in order of following; intraabdomen (3.8 ± 3.4 days), lower respiratory tract (15.8 ± 27.7 days), skin/soft tissue (17.3 ± 28.4 days), surgical site (23 ± 22.5 days), central venous catheter (41.7 ± 42.8 days) and urinary tract (50.0 ± 27.7 days). Mortality rate was 7.4%. Death was attributed to infection in four patients. In multivariated analysis, patients with infections are more likely to have prolonged hospital care (odds ratio (OR) = 1.042; p £ 0.001), long-term ventilator care (OR = 1.556, p < 0.001) and open fractures (OR = 7.113, p = 0.018). APACHE II score (OR = 1.037, p = 0.044) and duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.074, p = 0.001) were contributed to death, independently. Conclusions: Multiple trauma patients have high risk of infection. Most common infection was lower respiratory tract infection. APACH II score was not a risk factor for infection but a risk factor for death. The objectives of this study were to identify the incidence and risk factors of NIs and cost of the NICU stay attributed to NIs in a Turkish NICU. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 1, 2004 to May 31, 2005 , in the NICU of the Eskisehir Osmangazi University Hospital, 900-bed academic tertiary care centre with a 17-bed NICU. Exposure variables from maternal and newborn data were prospectively collected by daily visits. Diagnoses of NIs were based on the recommendations of the Centres for the Disease Control. Statistical analysis was performed with the software program SPSS (Version 10.0). Results: Of the 309 patients surveyed, 48 (15.5%) had acquired NIs. The most common site of NIs was found as urinary tract (39.4%), eye-ear-nose-throat (18.8%), skin and soft tissue (18.8%) and blood stream (12.5%). The relationship between NIs and probable risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay (+ 7 days), low birth weight, previous antimicrobial usage, corticosteroid treatment, intubation, mechanical ventilation, CPAP, surgery, total parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition and polycytemia were found statistically significant. The relationship between NIs and sex, gestational age, twin birth, route of delivery, home birth, low apgar scores were not statistically significant. Most common nosocomial pathogens were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and Klebsiella spp. The additional hospital stay because of NIs was 7.4 days. The median cost was found as 1061 Euro for newborns without NIs and 3082 Euro for newborns with NIs. Conclusion: The risk factors for NIs detected in our NICU were similar to those defined worldwide. Gram-negative bacteria were the leading cause of NIs. The increase in the medical cost due to NIs was remarkable.",11.182444381496941,6.073427836819064

Methods: We tested 15 NTM strains from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis symptoms, isolated in our centre within the last 2 years. All the strains were processed from subculture on LJ medium, confirmed as NTM using the niacin test and morphology assessment of the organisms. The LiPA assay based on the PCR and reverse hybridization procedure amplificated the 16S-23S ribosomal rRNA spacer region. Subsequently, the biotinylated PCR products were hybridized with specific 22 Objectives: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is today the single greatest cause of mortality due to an infectious agent. Routinely, mycobacterium infections are diagnosed by microscopic examination for the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and by conventional culture techniques. Detection of mycobacterium by culture takes between from 1 week to 2 months, and AFB testing both lacks sensitivity and specificity. Compared to culture, sensitivity using various available NAAT systems is generally lower. In addition, NAAT based systems require much hands-on time to obtain DNA/RNA of sufficient quality. Thus, the requirement for both a rapid and sensitive diagnostic system for TB diagnostics is still largely unmet. Method: A pilot study has been performed applying an automated sample preparation for mycobacterium DNA from respiratory samples utilizing magnetic particles. In this system (BUGS'n BEADS TM , Genpoint, Norway), heat-inactivated mycobacterium cells are initially adsorbed to paramagnetic particles and magnetically separated from the sample material.",5.896105298116559,5.73293178384519

The recent, profound modifications occurred among predisposing factors (increase mean patient [p] age, concurrent diseases, jatrogenic immunosuppression, alcoholism, drug use, migration, and HIV pandemic), played a key role in this process. Methods: Among the 128 consecutive p hospitalized due to T since 1996, we compared the 77 p from Italy with the 51 immigrants from extra-European countries, in relation of a number of risk factors, including HIV infection. Results: Compared with immigrants, native Italian p had a higher frequency of HIV-AIDS (32.4%; p < 0.001), and a prodominant pleuro-pulmonary involvement versus lymphnode and/or disseminated T among HIV-infected p versus non-HIV-infected ones (p < 0.01). Moreover, Italians had a greater mean age (p < 0.001), and an increased frequency and a broader spectrum of predisposing conditions (positive history, chronic lung, heart, liver, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, malignancies, and collagen vascular disease; p < 0.03), while foreigners had a lower frequency of more generic supporting factors (low income, economic-social problems, cigarette smoke, and alcohol-drug abuse; p < 0.03 versus Italians). Our decade experience shed light on two different patterns of T. Local p are predominatly represented by elderly with frequent concurrent disorders and specific T risk factors, a more frequent HIV infection, and a predominant involvement of sites other than pulmonary ones, while immigrants are represented by otherwise healthy younger p, who develop prevalent lung localizations.",11.516372699850603,5.0045821987190156

We examined risk factors for mortality among Irish patients with S. aureus BSI. Methods: A set of Irish hospital laboratories provide enhanced (clinical, demographic and risk factor) data on episodes of BSI reported to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS). Outcome data, including in-hospital mortality, has also been reported by a subset of laboratories since the beginning of 2005. We examined in-hospital mortality vs. survival before the end of each EARSS survey period (90 days) with logistic regression and survival analysis. Results: There were 116 episodes of S. aureus BSI reported, with 39 in-hospital deaths, 71 discharged and 6 still in hospital at the end of the survey period. Of all the factors examined, length of stay (LOS) prior to BSI, age and meticillin resistance were all significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Mortality among patients with MRSA BSI (n = 53, 60%) was significantly higher than among patients with MSSA BSI (n = 63, 11%). Cox regression, controlling for LOS and age, demonstrated that methicillin resistance was the only significant contributor to mortality (HR 3.4, 95%CI 1.2-9.2). The baseline survival curve is shown. Conclusion: Methicillin resistance remains a significant risk factor for in-hospital mortality among patients with S. aureus BSI after controlling for age and LOS.",9.288440907042505,4.587200755789327

We recovered 40 M. xenopi isolates from 1990 to 1994, and 56 isolates from 1995 to 1999. We considered 10 patients to be suffering from disease caused by M. xenopi. The number decreased for the second half of the study period (7 vs. 3 cases). Pulmonary disease was the most frequent clinical presentation (90%). One patient had clinical M. xenopi disseminated disease during this period. Eighty percent of all patients with disease were male. The mean age was 39.5 year. The most common risk factors associated with disease due to M. xenopi were smoking (90%), infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (40%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (30%). The mean CD4 cell count of the HIV-infected patients at diagnosis was 48 x 106/L. The most frequent clinical features were the respiratory symptoms (100%), followed by fever (60%), and constitutional symptoms (30%). Chest radiographs revealed cavitating pulmonary disease in 50% of all patients, and nodular disease in 30 %. The incidence of unilateral disease was 60%. The most common treatment regimen was isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol, and the average duration was 10 months. With treatment, all cases of non-HIV-associated disease had favourable outcomes, but those of HIV-associated pulmonary and disseminated disease were poor (50%). Conclusion: The increase in M. xenopi isolates noted in the three main hospital in Zaragoza (Spain) was due to changes in culture technique, and a more sensitive laboratory isolation technique, rather than a true increase in clinical disease. Chronic pulmonary disease is the most common clinical manifestation of M. xenopi in the nonimmunocompromised patient, but in HIV-infected patients causes both disseminated and pulmonary disease.",5.879237640614299,4.517753406415627

Underlying lung disease (aOR, 7.17; 95% CI, 2.78-18.50) and alcohol ex-drinker (aOR, 5.83; 95% CI, 1.36-24.95) by the age of 65 years was associated with higher risk of hospitalised CAP. Smoking, total amount of cigarette smoking, and duration of smoking by the age of 65 years were not significantly related to the risk of hospitalised CAP. The other factors, including performance status, BMI, other underlying diseases, were not associated with the risk of hospitalised CAP. Conclusion: Underlying lung disease and alcohol ex-drinker by the age of 65 years can be the independent risk factors for hospitalised CAP in elderly people in later period. The chronic previous exposure to smoking, however, is not a risk factor of hospitalised CAP in the same people. These suggest chronic respiratory damage due to cigarette smoking might not influence on the occurrence of acute lower respiratory tract infection in the community environment. A similar trend was also observed for high level P resistance (7, 6 and 14.3 % in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively) . Although it can be as high as 44.4% among pen I/R isolates, overall resistance to erythromycin was 15.1% with minimal variation for different periods of time. MLSb tpe resistance was dominant among ER isolates as shown both by phenotypic tests and PZR. No resistance to levofloxacin was detected. All of the Mc isolates were susceptible to amoxy-clav (AMC), fluoroquinolones and cefaclor. A small increment in b-lactamase positivity was seen over the years (78% in 2003 to 93% in 2005) . Hi isolates were also universally sensitive to 2nd and 3rd gen cephalosporins and AMC with b-lactamase production ranging from nil (2003) to 4. 3 % (2005) . On the other hand, trimetoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) resistance was high among all species. There is still a low rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics among respiratory pathogens but an increase in resistance to penicillin was noted in Sp and to SXT in all three species.",8.717892357592282,4.4828011189977435

In Southern Israel (population: 985,000) two ethnic groups live side by side: predominantly urban Jewish population and a population of Arab Bedouins (population: 144,000-14.3%) who are in social transition from being desert nomads to a settled lifestyle.The objective of the study was to evaluate the differences in characteristics and outcome of CAP between these two populations for patients hospitalised during one winter season. Methods: We conducted a hospital based prospective observational study. Soroka University Medical Centre is a 1200 bed tertiary care hospital, which serves as the only regional hospital for Southern Israel. During a 4-months period we assessed clinical as well as demographic characteristics of all patients hospitalised with CAP. Results: 262 patients were enrolled, of whom 58 (22.1%) were Bedouins. Bedouin patients were younger than the rest of the cohort (60.0 ± 20 vs. 66 ± 17 years, p = 0.05) and had lower rates of cardio-vascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease and cerebro-vascular disease (20.7% vs. 39.2%, p = 0.02). Bedouins had higher smoking rates (39.7% vs. 19.1%, p = 0.001), higher prevalence of COPD (31.0% vs. 9.3%, p = 0.001) and diabetes (41.4 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.01). There was no difference between pneumonia patients outcomes research team (PORT) scores of Bedouin and Jewish population at admission (median 83 points vs. 85 points, p = 0.61). Bedouin patients had lower rate of prehospitalisation antibiotics therapy compared to the rest (12.1% vs. 25.5%, p = 0.03). There were no differences in the length of hospitalisation (median 4 days, p = 0.8) or 30-day mortality rate between Bedouin and Jewish patients (3.4% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.26).",6.034612754106249,4.32818145025959

Infection is the second leading cause of death in this population, and catheterrelated bacteremia (CRB) a major cause of hospitalisation. Objectives: 1) To asses the incidence, epidemiology and risk factors for CRB in patients with TC on HD. 2) To know the length of TC use (catheter survival). Patients and methods: We prospectively analysed all consecutive TCs inserted in four Spanish hospitals from Sep/ 04 to Oct/05. We used IDSA definitions for intravascular catheter-related infections (CID 2001) . Characteristics of patients and TC, and risk factor associated with CRB during insertion and removal, were analysed. All patients were followed until CRB, death, removal of TC or time for the end of the study (one year). Data were colleted by an ''on-line'' database system. Quantitative variable were expressed as median (range). Chi-square and T-student tests were used for statistic analysis. Results: One hundred and twenty-eight TCs were inserted in 117 patients (57% males). Age: 71 years (20-88). Previous time on HD before TC insertion: 78.5 days (5-8701). Catheter survival: 162 days . Tunnelled catheters were used after other vascular accesses in 64% of patients. Six episodes of CRB were observed, with an incidence of 0.29/1000 catheter-days (total time 20711 catheter-days). The causative bacteria were: E. faecalis (N = 3), S. aureus MS (N = 2) and S. aureus MR (N = 1). Three tunnel infections were reported and two of them developed CRB. Time since catheter insertion to the onset of CRB: 23 days (5-141). Thirty-two TC were removed (although only 4 for CRB). Insertion in femoral or subclavian veins (RR 19, 95% CI 3-114; p 0.000), previous hospitalisation (RR 5.7, 95% CI 0.8-39; p 0.057) and surgical procedure (RR 13, 95% CI 0,9-178; p 0.022) 1-month before were associated with CRB. In the outcome we registered one death, one relapse (who later died) and two metastatic infections (septic arthritis and vertebral osteomyelitis). Two deads (33%) were CRB-related and another 3 deads (2.70%) were observed in the non-CRB group in one-year follow-up (RR 11.2, 95% CI 2.4-44.7).",6.547660395911051,4.310106734329214

Although the high prevalence of depression in these conditions is consistent with a PATHOS-D perspective, it is hard to imagine that other behavioral states associated with these diseases, including mania and psychosis, are adaptive for pathogen host defense. Indeed, the impaired decision-making characteristic of both states and the social isolation/reduced access to resources that is common in psychosis would be expected to increase vulnerability to pathogen exposure. Given overlapping genetic risk factors for these conditions and MDD, it is possible that they are best understood as purely maladaptive states supported at relatively low levels in the human population, at least in part, because their genetic antecedents enhanced host defense in carriers of immune-relevant risk alleles who responded to infectious challenges with enhanced immune activation and sickness behavior/depression without developing the full disease phenotype. Another possibility is that very severe disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have been maintained in the human genome because immune benefits accrued to afflicted individuals that counteracted the fitness-reducing behavioral profiles (including increased risk of infection) associated with these diseases. This scenario would suggest that immune changes seen in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder should be more robust than those seen in depression, because they would have to be large enough to offset behavioral costs not present in depression.

While for some groups the higher risk of presentation to ED for an ARI is likely because the disease incidence is higher (eg, preterm children), for others it could be lack of access to other primary healthcare providers, such as general practitioners in rural and remote areas. Indeed, the rate of general practitioners in rural and remote areas ranges from 53/100 000 population in the Pilbara to 141/100 000 population in the Kimberley compared with up to 171/100 000 population in Perth’s inner metropolitan area.26 The risk factors for presenting with ARI to ED were similar to those previously reported risk factors for admission to hospital for ALRI including being male, being born preterm, being from a low socioeconomic area and maternal age <20 years.7 Two previously observed risk factors for ALRI hospitalisation, maternal smoking and higher number of previous pregnancies7 were not risk factors for presenting to ED with overall ARI. This suggests maternal smoking is associated with increased severity of disease or specifically with lower respiratory infections. Different to hospitalisation, presentation to ED may be more influenced by individual psychological and social factors of the child’s parents or carers. Parents may be less likely to take their child to ED if they have had experiences with similar conditions in their older children and are more confident to manage their child’s illness at home. Conditions presented to ED are likely to vary more in severity, whereas hospitalisations tend to be only the very severe cases and the decision to hospitalise is more likely to be made by a clinician.",21.7238255232791,9.888237852014797

The emergence of COVID-19, which started as clusters of pneumonia with unknown etiology in China at the end of 2019, was unique and thus, a good example for KCDC to conduct a series of risk assessments to evaluate the potential risk of importation, transmission, and the impact at the country-level.

Risk of seawater inundation is expected to increase over the next few decades, due to predicted sea level rise and increasing frequency of extreme weather events, with the risk zone predicted to spread further inland and higher [31]. ENSO is known to be linked with extreme water temperature change. Two of the four accounts of outbreaks (both of which were cholera) following an ENSO event in the scientific literature were also linked to an extreme water temperature change. Studies have repeatedly linked ENSO events and extreme water temperature change to large-scale V. cholerae outbreaks [32, 33] and V. cholerae is known to show an increased growth rate at increased temperatures, with increasing global temperatures also expected to increase prevalence both geographically and temporally [34]. V. cholerae was by far the most common pathogen implicated in outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events, from both the scientific literature and ProMED, which may in part reflect the predominance of outbreaks following heavy rainfall and flooding. In a review of ProMED cholera outbreak reports from 1995 to 2005, Griffith et al. [20] found that rainfall and flooding were the most common risk factors globally (constituting 25% of all risk factors), alongside water source contamination (29%) and refugee settings (13%). The number of cholera outbreaks reported following extreme water-related weather events may also be attributable to a number of other factors such as the severity of the disease or reporting bias. When assessing the risk to public health of such outbreaks it is important to incorporate information not only from the most likely extreme water-related weather events (such as heavy rainfall and flooding), but also those from lower-probability but higher consequence events (such as ENSO or seawater inundation) [21].",11.056726212874013,5.2918166949860606

Firstly, the information in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak was preliminary and very limited, mainly since COVID-19 was a new emerging disease, and data from the Chinese government was the main source of information of this novel coronavirus. Thus, we conducted several risk assessments with the ongoing available evidence, in a very short period of time as the situation evolved rapidly. Therefore, the estimation was very likely to be subjective in nature. Secondly, the risk assessment tool was not strictly applied to this novel pathogen as critical information was missing and had to be estimated with limited confirmed evidence. Thus, initial evaluation of this virus pathogenesis was likely to be subjective, and was the one of major factors that needed to be considered when conducting the risk assessment. Once more scientific evidence and knowledge becomes available after the end of this pandemic, overall review procedures and evaluation mechanisms need to be developed to improve and to minimize the limitations of the existing risk assessments by the Korea CDC.",10.635816824585664,4.726228891067369

By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus.

By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (>10 x 10 9 /L) and neutrophilia (>75 x 10 9 /L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival.",9.505000365216745,3.6770865247063087
