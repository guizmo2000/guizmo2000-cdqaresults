Conclusions HCV patients with a sustained response to peg interferonα/ribavirin therapy display constant levels of IFN γ during the first 6 months of treatment. The level of IFN γ in recent HCV infections was much higher compared with more distant infections. The pre-therapy level of serum IFN ɣ did not influence the virologic outcome to the standard interferon α therapy. Background Risk-reduction campaigns are essential parts of national health programs.

In wild-type mice, torpor induction resulted in significantly greater MSD between 6 and 8 days postinfection (dpi), whereas in IFNAR1 Ϫ/Ϫ AB6 animals, MSD was slightly reduced by torpor (Fig. 6A) . These results suggest that the effect of reduced body temperature on CHIKV-induced disease signs manifests in an IFN-␣/␤-dependent manner, with low temperature leading to more severe disease only when functional IFN-␣/␤ is present.",13.455522478775977,6.682726332947492

Besides the ""fuel-vs.food"" issue and negative effects on GHG emissions and biodiversity from land-use change (see below), these fuels have undesirable chemical properties that prohibit their use for certain purposes or with existing infrastructure [67] . New generations of biofuels based on non-edible, lignocellulosic plant parts, special energy grasses or microalgae have thus been envisaged [17, [68] [69] [70] (Fig. 3) . In addition, rather than producing biodiesel or ethanol, some approaches aim to create ""drop-in"" fuels that can use existing infrastructure and can be mixed with fossil fuels in any ratio. These are based on synthetic hydrocarbons or higher-chain alcohols (like butanol) with high energy content, allowing gasoline, diesel and even aviation fuels to be replaced [67, 71] . In addition, strategies have been devised that use microorganisms to produce hydrogen [72] . All these approaches involve synthetic biology ideas and can be ascribed to one of two fundamental strategies: the microbial synthesis of fuels from materials produced by plants (see (i) and (ii), below) or their direct microbial photosynthesis from CO 2 and water ((iii) and (iv)) (see also overview in Fig. 4C ).",10.83579075163669,6.6013989025267295

This has substantial implications for public health educators and planners in implementing pandemic preparedness plans. It was evident that the knowledge score was the main predictor of the attitude and practice scores with strong correlation between knowledge and practice scores and knowledge and attitude scores. On the other hand, attitude scores alone did not predict practice score and the correlation between attitude and practice scores was weak. This shows that good knowledge is important to enable individuals to have better attitudes and practices in influenza risk reduction. In a previous study on SARS, better knowledge was also found to equate with better adoption of precautionary practices [6] . Clear communication and provision of updated information also helped improve vigilance and preparedness during the current pandemic [11] . A recent study found that educating the public about specific actions to reduce risks and communicating about the government's plans and resources helped to improve compliance to good practices [9] . Of interest, higher educational status in our cohort was a significant negative predictor of good practice, showing that educational status alone does not determine behaviours. Two previous studies on influenza [9] and SARS [2] also showed that education level did not have any effect on uptake of recommended behvioural patterns. Regarding influenza vaccine uptake and education level, some studies have showed that a higher education level resulted in higher influenza vaccination uptake [20, 21] , while another study on influenza vaccination uptake showed varying influence of education levels on influenza vaccination in different countries [22] . As such, it is important to focus on inculcating the correct knowledge to individuals as it will influence both attitudes and practices. On the other hand, positive attitudes on its own may not translate into desired behavioral change in the absence of adequate knowledge. For the exposure groups, influenza cases had the highest practice scores of all 4 groups. Use of masks was also highest among the influenza cases. Having been infected with pandemic influenza appears to have a substantial impact in behavior and adopting risk reduction practices. Although most if not all of these influenza cases will not be re-infected by the same pandemic virus again, adopting these practices will place them and their close contacts at lower risk for other influenza and respiratory virus infections.",14.360013533420606,7.749679582392708

Pending questions include: Which geographic areas will experience more disease and conservation problems? Which areas pose the highest risk for pandemic spread of pathogens?

And what are the relative roles of genetic relatedness and contact rate for transmission?

We have generated accurate estimates of the explicit costs of implementing such a program on a per-practice basis, which permits the extrapolation of these unit costs to other geographical domains. We have also provided some preliminary estimates of the potential cost savings to the health-care system. Due to the lack of knowledge about the frequency of respiratory infection occurring at physicians' offices, particularly an estimate of the reduction in the probability of infection attributable to the intervention, we did not have enough evidence to evaluate precisely the benefits of the intervention. As an alternative approach, we undertook a threshold analysis to estimate a threshold value of the efficacy that could render the intervention cost saving. Based on our conservative estimates referring to direct savings in the form of healthcare costs averted, there are indications that the outreach facilitation intervention program would result in cost savings if it could achieve a reduction in the probability of infection at the physician offices on the order of 0.83 percentage points. This implies that if we assume that there was a 1.00% chance of contracting influenza in FP offices without intervention, to achieve the efficacy rate of 0.83%, the probability of contracting influenza in FP offices with intervention would be 0.17%, representing a large relative risk reduction in influenza transmission in FP offices. On the other hand, if we assume a higher probability of contracting influenza in FP offices without intervention, such as 5%, to achieve the targeted efficacy rate of 0.83%, the probability of contracting influenza would be approximately 4.2%, representing a smaller relative risk reduction in influenza transmission in FP offices.",18.98033974625899,8.206305509014744

Varying PEDV survival among feed ingredients suggests that feed ingredients may need to be handled and processed differently based on virus inactivation kinetics and relative risk of transmission for a specific feed ingredient. When thermal treatment of complete feed was evaluated at high temperatures, heating complete feed at 120°C for 25 min resulted in a 3 log reduction in PEDV [17] . However, the previous study was performed using complete feed, and there has been limited information published regarding thermal treatment of PEDV in individual feed ingredients. If a feed ingredient is contaminated, studies have shown that it can then contaminate surfaces in a feed mill [9] . After surface contamination with PEDV, subsequent batches of feed can be contaminated with the virus [11] . Therefore, it is necessary to determine if any differences in virus survival among feed ingredients requires different thermal processing conditions to reduce the risk of subsequent contamination.

Possible reasons for this are that rabbits are easily stressed prey animals, they are difficult to intubate endotracheally and react to mask induction with volatile anaesthetics by extended breath-holding [4] [5] [6] . Rabbits have a large abdominal cavity in relation to the thoracic cavity, with the results that the pressure from the intestinal mass may interfere with respiration in dorsal recumbency during anaesthesia.

ARDS: CLINICAL STUDIES A1 Identification of distinct endophenotypes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome by unbiased cluster analysis, and their association with mortality","Gold standard was the diagnosis of sepsis according to ACCP/ SCCM consensus criteria based on the review of full patient charts by four independent physicians. Predictive accuracies of abstraction strategies were compared correcting for stratified sampling by using sampling weights. Following the analysis, false negatives and false positives were reviewed to determine reasons for misclassification. Results From 937 charts from adult patients that were accessible in full, 81 patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values are shown in Tab. 1. Overall, explicit coding strategies are limited in their sensitivity, but have a better positive prediction than implicit coding strategies. Identification strategies based on clinical and/ or microbiological sepsis codes risk underestimating true sepsis incidences by 1.4-2.2-fold, whereas indirect coding strategies carry the risk of overestimation. In explicitly identified cases which were coded false positive (n = 13), 23 % organ dysfunction was not caused by infection (23 %), infection or organ dysfunction were not documented in the chart (54 %) or patients did not meet two or more SIRS criteria (23 %). For the implicit approach, false-positives (n = 90) resulted from concurrence of infection and organ dysfunction without causality (51 %) or that infection or organ dysfunctions were not identifiable retrospectively by chart review (40 %). 9 % did not meet the SIRS criteria. In implicitly false-negatives (n = 21), organ dysfunction, infection or both were not coded in 67 %, 14 % and 17 % of cases, respectively. Conclusions Existing ICD coding strategies differ in their accuracy in identifying septic patients in hospital discharge databases and thus may over-or underestimate true sepsis incidences. Standardized and valid coding strategies for severe sepsis are needed to ensure comparability between epidemiological and intervention studies based on administrative data.",11.143003823483133,4.411526225500753

Meanwhile, even in developed countries, reactive control strategies such as isolation protocols for vaccinepreventable diseases have significant sociological impact beyond the immediate financial costs. Because of these challenges, the overarching goal is to optimize control interventions for the least amount of effort and expense. It is therefore important to gain as much quantitative information about disease transmission as possible from existing surveillance data. This includes monitoring how transmission varies with time, location and other epidemiological characteristics of individual cases. By improving the understanding of mechanisms of disease transmission, finer tuning within the spectrum of intervention strategies becomes possible [15, 16] .

Additionally, meditation for the purpose of emotional release may be beneficial for those engaged in emotional labor. Emotional intelligence, including emotional perception and expression, empathy, and emotion regulation, may be important for those engaged in emotional labor as they are required to display certain emotions in the presence of customers or others [9] . As integrative mind and body training improves attention and self-regulation through the interaction between the central (brain) and the autonomic (body) nervous systems [26] , the reduction in stress and the increase in emotional intelligence associated with MBT may contribute to the ability of those involved in professions that require high levels of emotional labor to self-regulate. A crucial factor for the stress reduction observed among the MBT subjects may be the increase in emotional intelligence that resulted from participating in the 8-week program; this is suggested by the inverse correlation between emotional intelligence scores and self-reported stress (Fig 5) . We can infer that the increase in emotional intelligence and the reduction in stress may closely and synergistically interact and that such dynamics may be induced or increased by MBT. Thus, this result offers important clues about the hidden mechanisms underpinning the ability of MBT to improve psychological well-being. Previous studies reporting an inverse relationship between stress and emotional intelligence [14, 17] further support our results. Given that emotional intelligence acts as a moderator between stress levels and psychological health [18] and increased emotional competence contributes to the use of adaptive coping strategies when dealing with stress [19] , the enhanced emotional intelligence observed among subjects taking part in the MBT program may have led to improved problem-solving and social-support coping as well as a reduction in stress. Although this 8-week online program did not include educational lecture programs specifically targeting coping strategies, subjects who participated in the program showed an increase in the frequency with which they used adaptive coping strategies. The healthy brain has a considerable capacity for resilience based on its ability to respond to interventions designed to open ""windows of plasticity"" and redirect its function toward better health [44] . Thus, given that meditation may potentially strengthen neuronal circuits and enhance cognitive reserve capacity [45] , the MBT program may contribute to the brain capacity and plasticity of healthy subjects, leading to more frequent use of adaptive coping strategies and reductions in stress.",10.484332266329051,1.8762011210197334

This research introduces a model that converts a simulated vacant school building into a community public hospital renovation project in order to validate the solutions made by hospital managers and suggested by the system. The result reveals that the system performs well and its solutions are more successful than the actions undertaken by decision-makers. This system can improve traditional hospital building condition assessment while making it more effective and efficient.",12.55419185870694,6.421796994306966

In the past, this disease often led to the abandonment of rich riverside farmland. But now, after regular mass treatment, people can return to these farming areas and resume farming.

The transboundary animal diseases (TAD:s) are also a concern for international trade [1, 2] and outbreaks of such diseases may cause enormous losses for society as a whole [3] . For the individual farmer, endemic diseases are usually of more interest, as these diseases have a higher impact on everyday production. Transmission between herds occurs via direct (live animal movements) as well as indirect (via physical vectors such as, people, transport vehicles and fomites) contacts [4] . Transmission via live animals represents the highest risk as moving an infected animal also moves the infection, but other routes of transmission are also important, as has been seen in various disease outbreaks [5, 6] . The risk posed by each contact between farms depends on disease prevalence and the biosecurity measures taken to reduce the risk. There is spatial variation in many risk factors for endemic diseases. The density of the susceptible species can also be reflected in the geographical distribution of a specific disease [7, 8] and a high animal density is often regarded as a risk factor for contagious diseases. There are also other geographical influences, as is seen in for example the prevalence of Coxiella burnettii [9] and verotoxin producing Escherichia coli in Swedish cattle herds [9] and Salmonella Dublin in Denmark, United Kingdom and Sweden [9] [10] [11] . The geographical risk reflects various transmission routes that occur more frequently in the local environment [12] . This is taken into account in the restriction zones laid down around infected premises in most disease control plans for TAD:s, such as e.g. African swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease [13, 14] . Insight into the geographical patterns of between-farm contacts is therefore important for exotic disease control. Some contact patterns can be associated with the prevalence of endemic diseases and may be used for assessing the risk for individual farms as regards endemic diseases [15, 16] . Biosecurity measures are essential for risk reduction and the application of such measures has been studied in various European countries [17] [18] [19] , including Sweden [20, 21] . The registration of livestock movements is mandatory in the European Union [22] [23] [24] and patterns of such movements have been studied in different EU member states e.g. UK and Sweden [25, 26] . Other contact patterns between farms are however less studied as such movements are rarely registered centrally, but the frequency of various contacts on farm level has been studied [27, 28] . To our knowledge, a geographical representation of actual indirect contacts between Swedish animal holdings has not been demonstrated. For the Swedish situation, assessing the geographical patterns of indirect contacts between farms has been one of the missing pieces of information in order to gain insight into the overall contact pattern between livestock holdings and the risk presented by these contacts.

The first option is to attempt to convince people to protect themselves as long as the virus is circulating, regardless of the context, that is, endemic or epidemic disease. Our results show that this objective seems very difficult to achieve and is probably unrealistic in the case of permanent or long-term health threats. Study of sustainable health-protective behaviour indicates that numerous difficulties make this aim unachievable. 13 However, an alternative option would be to adopt a flexible and targeted strategy: compliance to an effective protection measure would be asked in accordance with the level of viral exposure. The aim would be to achieve behavioural change limited to a temporary, but real protection, when the level of circulating virus is critical, as opposed to seeking an inaccessible and permanent degree of protection that is considered too costly for the vast majority of the population. This strategy would permit one to take into consideration the ratio of the two main components of risk reduction: benefits expected from a temporary protection and the level of exposure. In the case of a mosquito-borne virus, the higher the level of exposure the lower the probability of remaining healthy without adopting intensive, daily protection measures. In contrast, the benefits of having permanent protection during low levels of exposure are poor, because the risk of infection through mosquito bites is minor. This flexible strategy related to exposure enables one to better address the low capacity to sustain long-term and efficient individual protection in a cyclical context. The experience of the chikungunya outbreak in La Réunion indicates that the proportion of the population who protected themselves effectively during a short period reduced their risk of infection. However, two conditions are needed for this strategy to succeed in an endemic context: one is the capacity to monitor and predict the arrival of a new outbreak, 42 another is the ability to rapidly translate the alarm into a strong and convincing communication, as in the case of hurricanes, floods, heat waves, etcetera. From our viewpoint, protection against vectorborne diseases, such as chikungunya or dengue fevers, should benefit considerably from an exposure-related strategy, that is, modulating the fight against mosquitoes according to the level of exposure to the virus. This would improve the efficiency of protection measures and ultimately reduce the rate of infection.",15.697024212623251,8.181416655799364

The peak of the epidemic is protracted by about 1 day for every percent of contact reduction if this intervention starts immediately after the introduction of the infection. Thus, a peak shift is not only possible by early action, but also by the degree of contact reduction. If contact reduction is initiated later, the peak shift diminishes, but the proportionality remains. For example, if the intervention starts three weeks after the introduction of infection, the peak of the epidemic is only mitigated by about half a day per 1% contact reduction ( Figure 4B ). Premature cessation of contact reduction measures restores the infection rates to the pre-intervention values which fuels the epidemic.

The success or failure of vector control rests mainly on the nature and scale of the behavioural response of exposed populations. Large-scale adoption of recommended protective behaviour represents a critical challenge that cannot be addressed without a better understanding of how individuals perceive and react to the risk of infection. Recently, French overseas territories faced large-scale outbreaks: an epidemic of chikungunya fever in La Réunion and Mayotte (2005)(2006) and four successive outbreaks of dengue fever in one Caribbean island, Martinique (1995Martinique ( -2007. To assess how these populations perceived and responded to the risk, and how the nature and scale of protection affected their clinical status, socioepidemiological surveys were conducted on each island during the outbreaks. These surveys address three crucial and interconnected questions relevant to the period after persons infected by the virus were identified: which factors shape the risk of acquiring disease? Which sociodemographic characteristics and living conditions induce a higher likelihood of infection? What is the impact of risk perception on protective behaviours adopted against mosquito bites? Grounded on the results of these surveys, a general framework is proposed to help draw out the knowledge needed to reveal the factors associated with higher probability of infection as an outbreak emerges. The lessons learnt can inform health authorities' efforts to improve risk communication programmes, both in terms of the target and content of messages, so as to explore new strategies for ensuring sustainable protective behaviour.

Of course, the answers are based on similar principles than green chemistry initially developed by Anastas and Warner [166] . The principles cover various concepts such as: i) the use of bio-sourced ingredients, ii) the use of ""green concepts"" during the production (chemicals, synthesis processes, life cycle engineering, packaging, waste management), iii) the reduction of the negative impact of medication transportations, iv) the reduction of healthcare environmental footprint, v) the reduction of the use of pharmaceuticals and, vi) the improvement of the ultimate drug disposal with the use of take-back programs [167] . As CDs are bio-sourced compounds with very low toxicity dangers and easily biodegradable, they can be used to obtain more sustainable drug formulations in which CDs act as an active green ingredient and not only as an excipient. It is noteworthy that these CDs can be used alone or in combination with common petro-sourced medications. If a synergistic effect between the two molecules is obtained, a significant amount of the drug can be replaced by eco-and biocompatible CDs whilst maintaining the same biological activity.

The concept of Information Diet was introduced by Clay Johnson for the first time. He believes consumers should take responsibility for the type of information they consume, likewise the rational consumption of food. He also argues that there must be a sustainable news movement, like a sustainable food movement that has already started in the US. In other words, people and even governments are not capable of dealing with the media to a great extent, but people can create their own information diets, like food diet. Therefore, information consumers are advised to consume information in a limited way. However, they must demand complete and credible news, not news that is based on emotional content and full of advertisements"" (4). In the present Coronavirus crisis, some people spend most of their time studying related information regarding Covid-19 in written and virtual media; Meanwhile, they are unwilling to spend time exercising at home, talking to their families, playing with their children or doing other useful tasks such as studying, watching movies and so on. To seriously address these problems in the Coronavirus crisis, not only people must have optimum consumption of appropriate information, but also consuming information should comply with specific terms and conditions. For example, children should not be exposed to the news related to the Coronavirus, because this information increases anxiety and causes other psychological problems among them. The elderly is also vulnerable to the spread of information, and should be provided with reliable and limited information, and they should not be given the ongoing news. On the other hand, individuals should be able to distinguish between high quality and poor quality information, since much of the information regarding Covid-19 is invalid and is produced and published for economic, political, social, and in general profitable purposes (disinformation). Nowadays, in-formation is being provided every day, and by contemplating on and reviewing the publication of statistics related to the Coronavirus crisis on websites, blogs, social media, television and satellite channels etc., it can be understood that the overload of information has already occurred. Hence, providing people with all kinds of health literature is the only option. Although people may not have the ability to control the production and supply of the information nowadays, each of them must control the extent and type of the information which they consume. Therefore, in order to achieve a comprehensive information diet in societies, people need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills of health information literacy, media health literacy, media literacy and health literacy. Currently these trainings can only be delivered through the mass media. Delivering these skills requires specific knowledge and skills which health information professionals (medical librarians) poses, and they can train other people in the society through mass media relying on their abilities.",12.00403553504962,6.172510258264605

Barrier-reduction strategies may be particularly useful in longitudinal research given participants are likely to experience significant changes in their capacity to remain involved across the study's duration (typically years). Follow-up/reminder strategies, such as incentives and reminders, were associated with significantly poorer retention. This result was surprising, given that the previous review investigating retention strategies in longitudinal cohort studies found the opposite, that use of these follow-up/reminder strategies resulted in improved retention rates [6] . The lack of support for follow-up/reminder strategies found in the current review could be due to a number of extraneous variables including: (i) timing: studies may have implemented this strategy after other retention efforts proved ineffective; (ii) participant burden: the studies using follow-up/reminder strategies may have involved a high data collection burden (e.g., long surveys); (iii) sampling: studies using follow-up/reminder strategies may be over-represented in studies of difficult-to-retain populations, such as men. However, these explanations are unlikely, given that follow-up/reminder strategies were identified in most of the cohorts included in this review Alternatively, participants may perhaps view follow-up/reminder strategies as the research team ""badgering"" them to complete assessments, thereby damaging rapport. This negative perspective of follow-up/reminder strategies may be further exacerbated if the research team has not implemented sufficient barrier-reduction strategies to help make it easier for participants to remain involved in the study. Future research could consider investigating participants' perspectives of retention strategies in longitudinal cohort studies, ensuring that both active and inactive participants are included, to better understand the costs and benefits of different approaches. Interestingly, the current study found that simply adding more cohort retention strategies did not result in higher retention rates. These results contradict the findings of Robinson et al. [17] and Davis et al. [4] , who both found that the use of more retention strategies across multiple classes was associated with improved retention rates. However, neither study specifically examined participant retention in longitudinal cohort studies, and both synthesised their retention results using a narrative rather than meta-analytic approach. Given that the implementation of retention strategies can be costly in terms of both time and money, the overall number of strategies employed is important to evaluate. The interaction of quantity of retention strategies used and provision of flexibility needs to be better understood, given research protocols that accommodate the changing lives of participants should remain a key focus of retention efforts. Finally, we examined whether studies utilising new or emerging retention strategies had improved retention compared with studies using established strategies. Of the 95 retention strategies described in the included articles, 44 were identified as an emerging retention strategy that had not yet been described in extant systematic reviews examining participant retention [4, 6, 16, 17] . Emerging strategies included using social media and SMS to assist in tracing participants lost to follow-up, and the use of study websites and social media profiles for keeping participants up-to-date with study news and events. Emerging retention strategies were endorsed by only a handful of studies, and the use of a single emerging strategy was not significantly associated with retention rate. However, we found that studies that employed more emerging retention strategies were associated with improved retention rates. Importantly, emerging strategies were identified across all four retention strategy domains (barrier-reduction, community-building, follow-up/reminder, and tracing), demonstrating that the association between emerging strategies and improvements in retention are due to the use of modern technology to help achieve core cohort engagement goals. Thus, we recommend that researchers continue to innovate their retention efforts, particularly where such strategies may reduce participant burden.",19.663705010787606,9.26881272281367

The most common retention strategies were: cash/voucher incentives to complete a follow-up assessment (n = 59), sending a postcard or letter reminder to complete a follow-up assessment (n = 43), and offering participants alternative methods of data collection, such as completing an interview face-to-face or over the phone (n = 36). Retention strategies were grouped into four main retention strategy domains: (i) barrier-reduction strategies, such as offering childcare services, assistance with parking and transport, and engaging a participant sub-sample to evaluate data collection methods for the next wave; (ii) community-building strategies, such as creating a recognisable study brand via logos and colour schemes, giving away study merchandise to create a sense of project community (e.g., t-shirts with study logo), and sharing study results, news and events with participants via newsletters, social media, and feedback reports; (iii) strategies to improve follow-up rates within each wave, including cash or voucher incentives for varying levels of assessment completion, and use of phone calls, SMS, house visits, mail and email reminders to participants to complete assessments; and (iv) tracing strategies, such as collecting the details of alternative contact persons for each participant at baseline, using public or non-public records to find updated contact information for participants, and collecting detailed participant contact information via a locator document (e.g. full name, address, social security number, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.). The most commonly reported category was strategies to improve follow-up rates within waves, identified 306 times within the 143 cohorts, followed by barrier-reduction strategies (adopted 268 times), community-building strategies (adopted 181 times), and tracing strategies (adopted 138 times). Table 2 presents the retention strategies used, grouped by retention strategy domain. It compares the retention rate for those studies that did, or did not utilise a specific retention strategy type or domain. Of the 95 individual retention strategies examined, three demonstrated moderation of the retention rate. First, improved retention was associated with offering participants alternative methods of data collection (e.g., completing an interview face-to-face or over the phone) (median retention using strategy = 86.1%; median retention not using strategy = 76.3%; b = 0.24, p = .01), and having participants complete a locator document at baseline (median retention using strategy = 90.9%; median retention not using strategy = 78.1%; b = 0.49, p = 0.02). Finally, lower retention was associated with use of phone call reminders to participants to complete a follow-up wave (median retention using strategy = 72.7%; median retention not using strategy = 80.6%; b = 0.25, p = .05). There was weak evidence against the null hypothesis of no moderation effect for a further three strategies. This included having consistent research team members (median retention using strategy = 87.3%; median retention not using strategy = 78.1%; b = 0.67, p = .09); offering site and home visits for data collection (median retention using strategy = 83.9%; median retention not using strategy = 77.4%; b = 0.46, p = .07); and sending participants thank you, birthday or holiday cards (median retention using strategy = 84.9%; median retention not using strategy = 77.5%; b = 0.50, p = .07).

In particular, the present study is the first to conveniently use the effective distance in evaluating the effectiveness of travel restrictions using existing empirical data. When we analyzed arrival time data from July to September 2014, during which local preventative measures had yet to be deemed successful, all the models showed that travel restrictions resulted in very small estimates of absolute risk reduction (< 1%) and a relative risk reduction of approximately 20%. The effectiveness of travel restrictions tended to be greatest among AFRO countries, which instituted travel restrictions earliest between August and September 2014. The European countries had the lowest estimated effectiveness, but this is expected because of high connectivity with African countries by air transportation, the acceptance of medical evacuation for international aid workers and their historical context. Full cancellation of flights with affected countries did not increase the overall effectiveness of travel restrictions (Fig 4B and 4D ). This could be due to clusters of flights to countries that have not refused international travelers from source countries. This study highlights that travel restrictions were not as effective as anticipated. As implicated in a large-scale simulation study of travel restrictions [13] , an epidemic cannot be prevented with travel restrictions. Further, this very limited effectiveness has been consistently indicated by extensive modeling studies of pandemic preparedness planning [31, 32] . Preventative measures at borders may be effective in conjunction with concerted control efforts, including improvement in awareness of the epidemic's current situation among the public. Rather than expecting border control to be effective, it is better to give priority to locally controlling the spread of disease upon emergence [32, 33] . Although the international spread of EVD was limited from 2013-16, our results imply that limited global spread is attributable to successful local control, mainly in the three affected countries, since the effective reproductive number for all three affected countries had fallen to value close to 1 by late September 2014. These effective local interventions included health system strengthening, construction of healthcare facilities, contact tracing efforts and safe burial measures at source [28, 34] .",13.032324984465008,5.954413374441751

It is determined by natural and mechanical ventilation, which are influenced by many factors such as open doors, open windows and AC systems. When the ventilation rate changes from 1 ACH to 4 ACH, the respiratory dose via the long-range airborne route will be reduced from 0.26 to 0.19 TCID 50 , and the general infection risk will be reduced by 1.2% (Figure 7 ). If the ventilation rate increases to 10 ACH, the infection risk via the long-range airborne route will be less than half under only 1 ACH. With no ventilation, all virus in the air moves out only through inactivation and deposition, and the virus concentration in the air is much higher. Figure 8 shows how hand washing by the infected student and susceptible students influences the respiratory and intranasal dose. In the simulation, we hypothesised that hands become completely clean (no virus) after hand washing. The infected student's hands usually possess a large quantity of virus (TCID50), which will then be transmitted to surfaces and resuspended in the air. As shown in blue and red lines in Figure 8 , when the infected student's hand washing frequency is less than 6 times per hour, the decrease in the respiratory and intranasal doses for susceptible students is obvious. If susceptible students wash their hands, rather than the infected student, the infection risk reduction via fomites is slightly higher.

The most recent epidemic of SARS occurred in Beijing and Anhui, China in April 2004 and originated from laboratory contamination (WHO update 7; see Further Information).

Genereux, Lafontaine and Eukelbosh [15] identified some key determinants that facilitate knowledge-to-action strategies for better community health risk preparedness. The team argued that blending traditional and modern approaches, fostering community engagement, cultivating relationships, investing in preparedness and recovery, putting knowledge into practice, and availability of human and financial resources are key successful factors for integrating expertise and research in disaster management practice. Yet, a lack of emergency preparedness often exacerbates the underlying community health risks in resource-deficit minority-based areas in times of crisis and emergencies. Ho, Chan, Lam et al. [16] showed indicators capturing perceived water security in the non-emergency/normal period might not be associated with Health-EDRM preparedness attitude and coping ability in a water-stressed rural context of PRC China. Chan, Lam, Lo et al. [17] showed food-labelling and perceptions of food-related health risk might be influenced by face-to-face health education interventions and should be considered as a core emergency preparedness and health risk reduction management strategy to strengthen bottom-up resilience in minority communities. Kamara, Akombi, Agho et al. [18] conducted a systematic review of resilience and well-being evidence in southern Africa and showed disaster risk reduction interventions that were based only on Western modelled or scientific warning systems might undervalue traditional warning insights and undermine intrinsic and community capacities. To strengthen resilience and well-being outcomes, efforts should be invested to ensure household, community/indigenous knowledge, and government-level capabilities are harnessed. Public health planning models might be instrumental in facilitating the planning for Health-EDRM-related risk reduction efforts in both emergency and non-emergency situations [19, 20] .",22.860068439170277,9.141306399855608

This definition is somewhat narrow in scope. The aim of the participatory epidemiology is not only to apply techniques involving data acquiring from the community members. It is to involve the community in the research, disease control or disaster risk reduction projects as active subjects, not only as the object of observation. In order to address the vulnerabilities of the community and improve its resilience in a sustainable manner, we need the active participation of communities. Harvesting epidemiological intelligence is only one facet of the participatory approach. Second, why harvesting only qualitative data? There were successful projects with quantitative data acquired by i.e. SMS data submission (eg. Philippines). The veracity and validity of the data may be questionable, but it applies to both qualitative and qualitative data.One of the similar definitions: -Schwab M, Syme SL.

Am J Public Health 1997;87:2049-52.): (participatory epidemiology) ""implies working across disciplines and with the population itself, in defining variables, designing instruments, and collecting data (qualitative and quantitative) that reflect the ecological reality of life in that population, as people experience it."" -Catley., A; Alders RG, Wood JLN (2012). Participatory epidemiology: approaches, methods, experiences.

The term 'participatory' should be used to refer to the active involvement of communities in the definition of project objectives and development of disease control strategies and therefore should go beyond the simple provision of information to outsiders. This definition is broader in scope and more open. It stresses the active involvement of communities, which actually empowers their members, aside from being more willing to take part in a project. Any definition requires an established context; and, the context is not epidemiology, nor the research, but populations in their natural and social environment. There are numerous definitions of participatory epidemiology, and a good overview can be obtained in Margaret W Leung, Irene H Yen and Meredith Minkler Community based participatory research: a promising approach for increasing epidemiology's relevance in the 21st century, Int.

Although HCWs appear to be most affected by SARS, patients tend to infect the most people; therefore, vaccinating patients would achieve the greatest reduction in the number of HCWs infected. Additionally, for all the outbreaks the superspreaders were mostly patients and very few were family/visitors. Furthermore, superspreaders are the hallmark of SARS and MERS transmission, which have been evident in the observed outbreaks (Fig. 1) . For example, in South Korea, the index patient infected thirty individuals and in addition to two other patients collectively infected 75% of the cases involved in the outbreak [28] .

As disease begins to spread, individuals perceive increasing risks and vaccinate according to the decision model, thereby protecting themselves and interrupting potential chains of transmission to others. While all three strategies reduce the total number of infections, the local count strategy affords the greatest and most efficient protection of the three. Under the global prevalence strategy, perceived risk is homogeneous. As cases mount, the vaccination rate rises synchronously throughout the population, arguably resulting in too much too late vaccine coverage. The local strategies avert more infections with fewer vaccinations than the global strategy. As epidemics unfold, risk is both heterogeneous and dynamic, with some portions of the network experiencing greater forces of infection than others. Local decision-making allows earlier detection and response to increasing personal risk, and prevents unnecessary vaccination in lower risk settings, both prior to and following epidemic waves. The local count strategy is more protective than the local prevalence strategy. By tracking the number rather than proportion of infected contacts, individuals more accurately assess the local force of infection. For example, compare a solitary individual with just two social contacts and a gregarious individual with 20. If they both have two infected contacts, then their risk of infection will be similar (assuming that time spent with each contact is sufficient for transmission). Under local count, their perceived risk and consequent vaccination probability will be identical; under local prevalence, the solitary individual will perceive higher risk (i.e., 100% of contacts infected) than the gregarious individual.

However, if individuals with more contacts tend to spend less time with each one, then epidemiological risk may be more homogeneous throughout the network and the advantage of the local decision strategies reduced. Although we do not model this scenario directly, we considered a homogeneous network where all individuals have the same number of contacts. This is roughly equivalent to mass action models that assume homogeneous contact rates and complete mixing [54] .

Thus, vaccinating patients with chronic illnesses may prove challenging and in the absent of a readily available vaccine, however, results from clinical trials would provide some insight into the matter. The potential impact of vaccines in the control of MERS will remain unknown until the vaccines under study move beyond the preclinical stage and into clinical trials. Considering that MERS is a continuing threat among the Gulf countries, the use of the Infection Prevention & Control Manual for GCC countries aids in the implementation of the first and second vaccination strategies across these countries in the Middle East, if HCW vaccination were to be undertaken.

Their roles can be seen as operationalizing a strategic vision which was articulated by the International Labour Organisation Director General on 12 March 2015: 'The goal of decent work provides a solid basis on which governments can establish and reinforce the engagement of social partners, businesses and agents of local economic development in disaster risk reduction. Through better regulation, innovative partnerships, specific incentives and mechanisms of cooperation with local communities, this can be done. As actors and beneficiaries, employers, workers and their organizations have a dual role in disaster risk reduction and workplaces are focal points for prevention, mitigation, recovery and rehabilitation strategies' [11] . What an opportunity for OH professionals to engage at the highest levels for local delivery! ",19.943424586251474,8.405359400638226

However, little is known about the virus filter effect of egg passages. Furthermore, published data on the capacity of the vaccine processes in place to inactivate adventitious agents are not available for systematic review, and it is often assumed that the inactivation process completely inactivates likely viral contaminants. Thus, the viral safety of conventional influenza vaccines is primarily based upon historical safety records rather than specific data and facts. A novel risk-assessment model has been developed to qualitatively assess the risk of contamination of inactivated split and subunit influenza vaccines by a range of viruses and other agents that are not covered by bacterial sterility tests. To ensure broad applicability of the assessment, only common elements of the influenza vaccine production process were taken into account. In addition, to facilitate comparison of different viruses (despite the limited availability of data), relevant characteristics were rated in very basic, non-quantitative or semi-quantitative terms. The risk-assessment model uses a simple scoring approach (e.g. high, intermediate, or low) based on the characteristics of individual viruses, and an overall process risk-score is then calculated for each potential contaminant. The risk-assessment model can be used to identify potential contamination risks in influenza vaccine manufacture. It can also be used to compare and rate the relative risk associated with any of the viruses. The risk-assessment model does not take into account specific manufacturing processes and so can also serve as a useful tool to compare the relevance of any potential contaminant to different vaccine manufacturing processes using alternative cell substrates for the isolation and propagation of influenza virus.

As described by the CBD Secretariat, '[t]he overall objective of China's NBSAP is to undertake effective measures expeditiously to avoid further damage to the natural environment and resources in China and mitigate or reverse this serious situation. Specifically, the action plan has identified seven major objectives, including strengthening the fundamental studies of biodiversity; improving networks of protected areas; protecting wild species with biodiversity importance; protecting the genetic resources of crops and domesticated animals; in-situ conservation outside protected areas; establishing national networks of biodiversity monitoring and information; and coordinating between biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Twenty-six priority activities and eighteen priority programmes have been identified, including assessment of status of biodiversity and its economic values; assessment of representativeness and effectiveness of protected areas and identifying needs for establishing new protected areas; identifying priority wild animals for protection based on their biodiversity importance and level of their risks to endangerment; mainstreaming biodiversity into national economic development plan; promoting ecofarming; establishing standardized monitoring techniques; and setting up model areas for well-coordinated biodiversity protection and sustainable development. China has also developed sectoral plans for conservation and sustainable use of agricultural, forest, marine and coastal and wetland biodiversity'. 46 In addition, China has taken measures to achieve its target by 2010 in accordance with the consensus reached in April 2002 by the CBD state parties 'to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on Earth'. 47 However, in its action plan, China admitted that it 'is still in the primary stage of biodiversity conservation. It still faces many problems and difficulties, and has a long way to go to achieve effective conservation of its biodiversity'. 48 In addition to the efforts that individual ASEAN states make under the legal framework of the CBD, they conduct collective undertakings for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of biological resources. For this, the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) was established in September 2005. It 'aims to create, promote, and develop links with the public, private sector, civil society, international development institutions, and donor community for the sustainable use of biodiversity'. 49 According to the ASEAN Declaration on Environmental Sustainability adopted in November 2007, the ACB will be promoted as 'a regional centre for biodiversity conservation and management' in East Asia. 50 In April 2008, environment officials from ASEAN member countries met to identify the core concerns and issues of biodiversity conservation, which will serve as a basis for ACB's long-term frame of action. 51 In respect of China-ASEAN cooperation, the Singapore Declaration on Climate Change, Energy and the Environment adopted in 2007 at the 13th ASEAN Summit mentions the protection of biodiversity, and conservation and sustainable management of coastal and marine ecosystems. 52 In the ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation Work Plan 2007-17, the ASEAN members, China, Japan and South Korea agreed to forge closer cooperation among themselves in the area of biodiversity and natural heritage conservation. 53 In addition, a biodiversity conservation corridor has been established in the GMS as discussed in Chapter 5.",10.345045407919201,7.329944590834617

In this process, resources can play an important role. Thus, against the globalization background, a city needs to size up the situation from the angle of globalization, utilize new resources; meanwhile, it also needs to develop and create local resource for improving competitiveness [1] .As illustrated in the definition from the report 'Our Common Future' [2] : ""Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their own needs"". Krized and Power [3] argue that sustainable development was a global vision although it had been taken up by planners in the U.S. and other developed countries. According to Hopwood[4] , the concept of sustainable development is seen to be the result of the growing awareness of the global links between mounting environmental problems, socioeconomic issues dealing with poverty and inequality, and concerns about a healthy future for humanity. It does not mean having less economic development, on the contrary, a healthy economy better able to generate the resources to meet people's needs, and new investment and environmental improvement often go hand in hand [5] . In the view of Couch and Dennemann [6] , while economic development may be a legitimate policy goal, to be sustainable it must be achieved within the context of reducing the ecological footprint. The central value of sustainable development can be boiled down to a balance among the three 'E's: environment, economy, and equity [7] . As illustrated in Godschalk [8] , sustainable development seeks to reconcile the conflicts among economic development, ecological preservation, and intergenerational equity; three conflicts exist among sustainable development value. The 'property conflict' between economic growth and equitable sharing of opportunities arises from competing claims on uses of property as both a private resource and a public good; the 'resource conflict' between economic and ecological utility arises from competing claims on the consumption of natural resources and the preservation of their ability to reproduce; the 'development conflict' between social equity and environmental preservation arises from competing needs to improve a lot of poor people through economic growth while protecting the environment through growth management. (See Fig.1 It is clear that resources are a strategic factor in the process of sustainable development and the resource conflict exists between ecology and economy. Some resources, such as mineral products and oil, are non-renewable; they will be used up one day, so it is necessary to find new resources to replace them. By contrast, tourism resources, including natural landscape as well as historical and cultural resources, are renewable and can be redeveloped and utilized if they are well managed, maintained, and developed. As a tertiary industry, the sustainable development of the tourism industry is thought to be of paramount importance for urban development; its development relies mainly upon the sustainable utilization of tourism resources.",12.508643560360895,6.630270153743883

As for tourism resources, whether they are used in a sustainable manner or not are the key point. So this study promotes a sustainable development system of urban tourism for Weihai, while offering the above macro suggestions. As shown in Fig. 6 , urban resources are generally composed of four kinds: natural resources, historic resources, cultural resources, and other resources. In order to fulfill a sustainable development program, the government needs to protect natural and historic resources. It also needs to combine urban and tourism landscapes for the reasonable utilization of natural resources and to combine general buildings with historic buildings. As an important tourism resource, culture may become the most attractive point for tourists. As Weihai has the regional advantage of being near Korea, the local culture and Korean culture are both the main cultural resources, and the communication of the two kinds of cultures will enable them to develop sustainably. In addition, there are probably other resources that have not been developed yet; perhaps they need to be uncovered and developed by the government in order to provide sustainable development.

This false sense of security was refl ected in the section on 'Self-perceived risk of contracting HIV/AIDS' in a study conducted by the Futures Group ( 2004 : 17) . This study explored the levels of HIV/AIDS knowledge among respondents and their attitudes and behaviours towards AIDS related issues. The study found that 78% of those surveyed believed themselves to be at 'low-risk' of contracting HIV/AIDS, and that the main reason for such a belief was because very few of the respondents (2%) reported that they knew of a PLWHA or a person who had died from AIDS. Therefore, because they themselves had not known anyone affected by HIV/AIDS, their perception of the virus was that it is something that affects the 'other' or that it only affected 'degraded people' (Futures Group 2004 : 17) . Consequently, because they did not fi t either category, they believed themselves to be of little risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Self-perceived risk has also been skewed by the government's HIV/AIDS prevention policies, which have long been focused on 'high-risk' groups. It can be argued that current prevention strategies actually put women at risk because they stress partner reduction over condom use as an effective way to avoid HIV transmission. The 'one partner' or 'faithfulness' prevention messages, which teach both men and women to protect themselves against HIV transmission by limiting the number of partners they have to one, has been described by UNAIDS as lulling people into a 'false safety' (UNAIDS 2002 : 44) . Surveys that have been conducted in China among traditional 'low-risk' groups such as married women, who do not engage in any of the traditionally recognized 'risky practices' conducive to HIV transmission, have found that most women believe that limiting the number of partners they have to one is much better protection against HIV transmission than using condom s (UNAIDS 2002 : 44) .

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials investigating antimicrobial prophylaxis or metaphylaxis against naturally occurring bovine respiratory disease,"One sentence summary: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials investigating antimicrobial prophylaxis or metaphylaxis against naturally occurring bovine respiratory disease. Editor: Edmundo Calva ABSTRACT A distinct difference between veterinary and human medicine is the routine use of antimicrobial mass medications (prophylaxis, metaphylaxis) to healthy individuals. The need for antimicrobial mass medications is based on beliefs that group/s of animals will contract a bacterial disease (i.e. morbidity) and/or die (i.e. mortality). Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) represents the major indication for cattle antimicrobials worldwide. The objectives were to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) for naturally occurring BRD investigating antimicrobial prophylaxis/metaphylaxis to prevent morbidity/mortality. In total, 58 publications met the inclusion criteria summarizing 169 individual RCTs, spanning 50 years . Antimicrobial prophylaxis and metaphylaxis demonstrated moderate, yet highly variable relative risk reductions in BRD morbidity. These were dependent on the antimicrobial classes used, dependent on metaphylaxis definition, BRD attack rates and duration of the RCTs. Best relative risk reductions were from broad-spectrum critically important antimicrobials, or combinations. BRD prophylaxis/metaphylaxis represents major antimicrobial consumption for highly variable short-term gains in absolute risk reduction of morbidity/mortality. Despite widespread use of prevention products, the need for antimicrobial mass medications should be re-evaluated since the underlying problem is more likely the segmented infrastructure of the feedlot and veal calf industries compared to the disease itself.",10.221911833467894,6.08555172485509

This is based on several randomized controlled trials. However, whether these recommendations should apply to older adults is less uncertain. A systematic review and meta-analysis examined the evidence for harm and efficacy of pharmacologic prophylaxis of DVT in older adults. For the most part older adults with comorbidities have been excluded from studies. The majority of events prevented in studies are asymptomatic DVTs. There is no consistent reduction in fatal pulmonary embolism or mortality. When data from the three trials with patients older than age 75 are pooled, a similar reduction in endpoints to other trials is seen. However, two-thirds of these events are asymptomatic DVTs. In the general population, the absolute bleeding risk is generally increased by 2 % in the heparin treatment group. Older age with its comorbidities may increase this risk. The current data suggest that this patient would gain a very small absolute risk reduction for symptomatic DVTs and an even smaller risk for pulmonary embolism.

Indeed, public awareness and attitudes can help in disaster risk reduction and management efforts toward reducing mortality and economic losses. In Saudi Arabia, many cities have been recently experiencing incidences of disasters, such as floods, disease epidemics, and sandstorms. However, studies on public perception of disaster risk in the country are few and nascent. Therefore, based on a questionnaire survey (n ¼ 683), this paper explores public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in Dammam, a coastal metropolis in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that although almost two-thirds (64.7%) of the participants are aware of disasters, and 81% are concerned about disaster risks, less than half (47.3%) believe that their settlements could be at risk. While 37% opine that disasters are caused by both natural factors and human activities, about half (54%) indicate that they can personally contribute to reducing disaster risks. Chi-square analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between place of residence and perception of disaster risks (χ2 (6) ¼ 56.18, p < 0.05), and between place of residence and concern about disaster risks (χ2 (12) ¼ 68.47, p < 0.05).

The perceptions of safety is an important aspect of destination image, and different types of risks and events have been studied in the context of visitor travel information seeking and decision making (Sharifpour, Walters, Ritchie, & Winter, 2014; Trumbo et al., 2016; Williams & Bal� a� z, 2015) . Re-establishing public perceptions of safety and attractiveness following a disaster is crucial to attract and reassure potential visitors to travel to the destination and, by doing so, assisting the affected area to regain functionality and economic recovery (WTTC, 2018) . In addition to understanding visitor perceptions, it has been found that addressing risk perceptions and behaviours of relevant tourism stakeholder is critical for effective disaster response and recovery (Kozak, Crotts, & Law, 2007; Park & Reisinger, 2010) . Tourism is exposed and vulnerable to multiple types of hazards (Becken, Zammit, & Hendrikx, 2015) , and disasters have the potential to deter visitors from travelling to affected destinations (Bhati, Upadhayaya, & Sharma, 2016) . However, empirical research that confirms or quantifies the relationship between disasters and tourism activity is scant. Existing studies have taken a case study approach (e.g. for Chinese outbound tourism, see Jin, Qu, & Bao, 2019) , but a global analysis is missing (Ghaderi, Mat Som, & Henderson, 2014; J� onsd� ottir, 2011; Mazzocchi & Montini, 2001; Ruci� nska & Lechowicz, 2014) . It is therefore timely to undertake a global study that uses a consistent approach to measuring the impact of disasters on international tourism movements.

We present solutions for a sustainable urban transportation system by establishing a simplified system dynamics model with a timeframe of 30 years (from 1995 to 2025) to simulate the effects of urban transportation management policies and to explore their potential in reducing vehicular fuel consumption and mitigating CO 2 emissions. Kaohsiung City was selected as a case study because it is the second largest metropolis in Taiwan and is an important industrial center. Three policies are examined in the study including fuel tax, motorcycle parking management, and free bus service. Simulation results indicate that both the fuel tax and motorcycle parking management policies are suggested as potentially the most effective methods for restraining the growth of the number of private vehicles, the amount of fuel consumption, and CO 2 emissions. We also conducted a synthetic policy consisting of all policies which outperforms the three individual policies. The conclusions of this study can assist urban transport planners in designing appropriate urban transport management strategies and can assist transport operation agencies in creating operational strategies to reduce their energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The proposed approach should be generalized in other cities to develop an appropriate model to understand the various effects of policies on energy and CO 2 emissions.",11.177904277156548,6.578725574601457

When a patient is admitted to a unit able to provide a higher (lower) level of care than required, a waste (overuse) of resources can be advocated. StART is an approach to identify possible mismatches between the level of care actually delivered, assumed to correspond to what is clinically required, and the level of care deliverable by the unit. Methods ICU beds are classifi ed by levels of care deliverable as High (ventilator, monitor, and 720 minutes nurse time) and Low (monitor and 360 minutes nurse time) [1] . The level of care actually delivered is classifi ed as High (invasive or non-invasive ventilation, or two vasoactive drugs, or at least two of the following: one vasoactive drug, dialysis, respiratory support), Low (single vasoactive drug, or dialysis, or respiratory support) and Ordinary (none of the above) [2] . Mismatches between the level of beds available and the level of care delivered were evaluated both on admission and for each ICU-day of 4,237 patients in 28 ICUs. An ICU-day was judged as inappropriate, even without mismatch, if an Ordinary patient was present. [1] . Patients in critical care typically receive highrisk medications. Error reporting is integral to identifying common errors and medication risk reduction. Methods A medication reporting form was developed to run alongside the offi cial hospital incident reporting system for 2 weeks. Forms were distributed throughout the critical care facility.

Among 35 participating countries included in our evaluation, all indicators examined by using WHO data sources have shown dramatic improvement. The increase in influenza testing since the start of the program may be driven in part by the growth in ILI and SARI sentinel sites that collect weekly samples.

First, we need to fully implement the International Health Regulations (IHR) in countries of all income levels. Reports from WHO and the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board have shown that responses to urgent crises have improved under the IHR (2005), but important deficiencies in coverage still exist. 3, 4 We must scale up laboratory capacity and other surveillance capabilities, augment the readiness of health systems to care for large numbers of seriously ill patients while safe guarding the health-care workforce, and improve communication and coordination strategies and implementation. 5 Procurement and supply chain management must also be enhanced to ensure adequate stocks of personal protective equipment and essential medications and to enable equitable access to new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines during health emergencies. 6 Second, we need to accelerate progress towards achieving the priorities and targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 7 which was adopted by UN member nations in 2015. The Sendai Framework applies an all-hazards approach to increasing international, regional, national, and local resilience to withstand a broad spectrum of disasters, including epidemics, pandemics, and epizootics. Preparedness for emerging infectious diseases requires strengthening health systems and developing response plans that account for the social, environmental, political, and institutional factors that can either support or disrupt emergency management efforts. 8 The Sendai Framework complements the IHR by integrating infrastructure, climate change, and economic considerations into disaster management plans and promoting inclusive policies that protect vulnerable populations during all phases of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 7 Third, plans for preventing, detecting, and controlling outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases need to be built on a One Health foundation that emphasises the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and ecosystems. 9 Transdisciplinary, multisectoral strategies are necessary when seeking to solve complex problems that threaten global public health and safety. 10 More specifically in relation to diseases such as COVID-19, One Health focuses on the danger existing at the human-wildlife interface. The ability to detect viruses in livestock and wildlife is a crucial component of early warning systems for human pandemics. 11 ",12.142665287913871,5.7514165027655135

Previous clinical studies furnished the risk of each outcome for each age and risk category (high risk versus not high risk for contracting influenza). Age-and sex-weighted average wage data helped estimate lost productivity for each outcome. As before, the economic cost of a death was equal to the present value of how much the victim would have earned in his or her remaining lifetime. By use of this procedure, the investigators estimated that without large-scale immunization, an influenza epidemic would cost somewhere between $71.3 billion and $166.5 billion.

Infection rates and adverse events were analyzed by 2 test. For the statistical analysis of body temperature parameters, a repeated measures ANOVA model was used. The level of statistical significance was established as p < 0.05. Meanwhile, intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analysis were performed as the assessment. Parameters for assessment of benefits or harms of the intervention included: the rate at which events occur in the control group (the control event rate, CER), the rate at which events occur in the experimental group (the experimental event rate, EER), relative risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and number needed to treat (NNT). Measures of RR, RRR, ARR and NNT were determined as these following formulae: RR = EER/CER, ARR = CER-EER, RRR = ARR/CER, NNT = 1/ARR [18] .",18.774268758440844,9.108063547065548

Closing lecture and concluding remarks C. Nannei and S. Goldin (WHO) delivered the closing lecture focused on the progress and challenges for sustainable influenza vaccine production to ensure pandemic preparedness. A holistic approach to preparedness should include surveillance, evidencebased policies, strategies to deploy influenza vaccines, and sufficient vaccine supply. Considerations for rapid deployment of vaccines in an emergency include regulatory capacity, distribution systems, monitoring systems, healthcare workers' familiarity with influenza immunization, vaccination policies for target groups and communication strategies. From 2006 to 2016, global seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity tripled from 500 million doses to 1.5 billion doses. During the same period, the estimated global pandemic influenza production capacity grew from 1.46 billion to 6.37 billion potential doses.

Currently, areas that were endemic just to DENV, for instance, are with autochthonous cases of chikungunya and Zika diseases. These arboviruses have similar clinical spectrum and require an efficient laboratory diagnosis, especially for a rigorous epidemiological surveillance. In addition, CHIKV infections represent a serious public health problem. The high morbidity of chikungunya often results in absenteeism of afflicted individuals, incurring both psychosocial and economic impacts. In this context, the development of a specific anti-CHIKV drug is certainly an important demand. On the other hand, the ideal control strategy for CHIKV should combine an integrated vector management with mass immunization. Although the different vector biocontrol strategies are promising, mainly within an integrated use, it is necessary to think about their sustainable use, assessing their real impacts on ecosystem equilibrium. The absence of CHIKV serotypes is considered a facilitative aspect in anti-CHIKV vaccine development, since a formulation developed from one strain will likely result in immunity against all CHIKV (Smalley et al., 2016) . Despite recent advances in vaccine strategies, the major challenge regarding CHIKV vaccine development remains the establishment of an equilibrium between immunogenicity and safety, notably a reduction of side effects, such as secondary arthralgia following immunization with attenuated virus. Finally, recognizing the competence of vector and arboviruses control measures, we believe that the prevention of CHIKV infections should be planned within a global and multifactorial approach. This interdisciplinary strategy, currently framed within the One Health concept, should thus integrate all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment (Benelli and Duggan, 2018) .",11.440613245115692,7.086568633021022

Patients with persistent clinical instability are often readmitted to the hospital and may not be candidates for shortduration therapy. Short-duration therapy may be suboptimal for patients with bacteremic S. aureus pneumonia (because of the risk of associated endocarditis and deep-seated infection), for those with meningitis or endocarditis complicating pneumonia, and for those infected with other, less common pathogens (e.g., Burkholderia pseudomallei or endemic fungi). An 8-day course of therapy for nosocomial P. aeruginosa pneumonia led to relapse more commonly than did a 15-day course of therapy [279] . Whether the same results would be applicable to CAP cases is unclear, but the presence of cavities or other signs of tissue necrosis may warrant prolonged treatment. Studies of duration of therapy have focused on patients receiving empirical treatment, and reliable data defining treatment duration after an initially ineffective regimen are lacking. Drotrecogin alfa activated is the first immunomodulatory therapy approved for severe sepsis. In the United States, the FDA recommended the use of drotrecogin alfa activated for patients at high risk of death. The high-risk criterion suggested by the FDA was an Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Assessment (APACHE) II score у25, based on a subgroup analysis of the overall study. However, the survival advantage (absolute risk reduction, 9.8%) of drotrecogin alfa activated treatment of patients in the CAP subgroup was equivalent to that in the subgroup with APACHE II scores у25 [92, 280, 281] . The greatest reduction in the mortality rate was for S. pneumoniae infection (relative risk, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.88) [282] . Subsequent data have suggested that the benefit appears to be greatest when the treatment is given as early in the hospital admission as possible. In the subgroup with severe CAP caused by a pathogen other than S. pneumoniae and treated with appropriate antibiotics, there was no evidence that drotrecogin alfa activated affected mortality.",13.477478709864325,4.00330384420027

As such these lectins can contribute to the development of integrated insect pest control strategies and provide a nice alternative to the use of classical chemical insecticides or the use of B. thuringiensis toxins that exhibit little toxicity against sap sucking insects. Similar strategies can be used to engineer plants with enhanced resistance to bacterial, viral and fungal diseases.

For example, the reimbursement rate of inpatient care was relatively low in 2011, ranging from 44 to 68% among the three public insurance programs, all of which left the insured to bear a relatively large share of the burden of inpatient care. The low benefit level was a direct result of the modest premiums. Table 2 shows that the annual premium was only US$24 and US$21 for NRCMS and URBMI, respectively, both of which were too low to offer any generous benefit coverage. Not surprisingly, the published evidence is equivocal about whether China's coverage expansion reduced patients' financial risk [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . At the national level, the proportion of out-of-pocket expenditures to total national health expenditures was significantly reduced from 60% in 2001 to 35% in 2011 (Fig. 1) .

Priority 1 is understanding disaster risk. DRM should be based on an understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions of vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics, and the environment. Priority 2 is strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk. Disaster risk governance at the national, regional, and global levels is very important, and this should be ensuring the consistency with domestic laws, regulations and policies of national and local framework. Priority 3 is investing in DRR for resilience. Public and private investment in disaster risk prevention and reduction through structural and non-structural measures are essential to enhance the economic, social, health, and cultural resilience of persons, communities, countries, and their assets, as well as the environment. Priority 4 is enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to ""Build Back Better"" in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. Having experience is to strengthen disaster preparedness and to have effective recovery. In their approach to DRR, States, regional, and international organizations and other relevant stakeholders should take into consideration the key activities listed under each of these four priorities and should implement them, as appropriate, taking into consideration respective capacities and capabilities, in line with national laws and regulations. In the context of increasing global interdependence and concerted international cooperation, developing the knowledge sharing, capacities and motivation for DRR are needed. The SFDRR is guided by following 13 principles 1. Primary responsibility of States to prevent and reduce disaster risk, including through cooperation. 2. Shared responsibility between central government and national authorities, sectors and stakeholders as appropriate to national circumstances. 3. Protection of persons and their assets while promoting and protecting all human rights including the right to development. 4. Engagement from all of society. 5. Full engagement of all State institutions of an executive and legislative nature at national and local levels. 6. Empowerment of local authorities and communities through resources, incentives, and decision-making responsibilities as appropriate. 7. Decision-making to be inclusive and risk-informed while using a multi-hazard approach. 8. Coherence of disaster risk reduction and sustainable development policies, plans, practices, and mechanisms, across different sectors. 9. Accounting of local and specific characteristics of disaster risks when determining measures to reduce risk. 10. Addressing underlying risk factors cost-effectively through investment versus relying primarily on post-disaster response and recovery. 11. ""Build Back Better"" for preventing the creation of, and reducing existing, disaster risk. 12. The quality of global partnership and international cooperation to be effective, meaningful, and strong. 13.

Although, in the past, China has been criticised for a lack of transparency related to epidemiological surveillance data, this rapid openness goes beyond what most countries are doing today. 3 Rapid analyses, including computational modelling efforts, are vital to assist decision makers in these largely uncharted waters; however, these analyses are only as good as their data. Our daily understanding of the pandemic is primarily based on the number of confirmed cases reported (eg, WHO daily reports and online dashboards 4 ), which can only be interpreted with an understanding of who is being tested (eg, only severe cases) and laboratory capacity. To correct the epidemic curves, data on testing capacity and test eligibility criteria over time across the globe are urgently needed. Furthermore, insights to the frequency of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections from individuals tested for the virus or antibody responses, irrespective of symptoms, will greatly improve real-time assessments. 5 The interventions implemented throughout China include complete lockdown of cities, active case surveillance, rapid investments in increased testing capacity, isolation of cases, treatment of severe cases, quarantine of cases and high-risk groups, and behavioural risk-reduction strategies, such as the compulsory use of masks in the general population. The trajectory of the epidemic curves in China alone suggest that these measures-some of them extreme-might have led to substantial reductions in transmission as of late March, 2020. China made difficult decisions with complex trade-offs between economic and social consequences and acute health effects on the basis of little historical data. These decisions pave the way for other countries to design responses to COVID-19 on the basis of their experiences. The encouraging results from Zhang and colleagues' study provide hope that rapid control might be possible, although with high economic and social costs. Countries across the world are making some of the same policy decisions, effectively halting their economies in the hopes of avoiding a massive death toll, but such lockdowns cannot go on forever. In the search for a new sustainable normal, countries and municipalities will inevitably adopt a range of approaches adapted to local specificities in the coming months. Through open documentation of these varying policy choices and timelines, and real-time assessments of their effects, we can and must generate evidence to minimise the acute and long-term consequences of this pandemic.",18.580876766144854,9.534385564401614

However, the rate of surgical site infections was higher during the SARS period than the pre-SARS period. Interestingly, the most noticeable change in the frequency of infections happened in pneumonia (31.8% versus 14.9%) and urinary tract infections (12.8% versus 2.1%). It is difficult to explain the exact cause of this trend. However, pneumonia, bacteraemia and urinary tract infections are HAIs that are often associated with the use of invasive devices such as endotracheal tubes or invasive mechanical ventilation and suctioning in pneumonia, central venous catheters and chest tubes in bacteremia and urinary catheters in urinary tract infections. Given that a number of MOHLTC's directives were specific to respiratory and high risk procedures (Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, 2003b) , it is possible that this trend of risk reduction is attributed in part to the strict enforcement of the guidelines outlined in those directives. It is unclear why the risk of surgical site infections and other infections were higher in the SARS period. However, it is possible that these two findings were the result of chance due to the very small number of patients who acquired these infections in our sample. Our findings show that, after adjusting for commonly reported risk factors of HAIs such as use of mechanical ventilation, use of central venous catheters and use of chest tubes; the odds of developing HAIs were 2.2 times higher in the pre-SARS period than the odds of HAIs in the SARS period. This adjusted finding suggests an independent association between the risk of developing HAIs and the time period (i.e., pre-SARS versus SARS). Although we did not directly measure the impact of enforcing infection control strategies and vigilance of healthcare workers on the risk of HAI between the two periods, this finding could be possibly explained in light of these strategies and the other changes that were implemented during the SARS outbreak. This is because enforcement of infection control strategies through a series of specific directives from the MOHLTC was the main event that distinguished the change in practice between the two periods. Additionally, our pre-SARS data was obtained from the three months that immediately preceded the SARS period whereby no change in practice other than those implemented to counter the SARS outbreak took place. Our findings support the argument that enforcing strict infection control strategies is associated with reduction in the risk of developing HAIs. For instance, Won et al. (2004) reported that promoting a hand hygiene programme resulted in increase in hand hygiene from 43% to 80% and reduction of HAIs from 15.13 to 10.69 per 1000 patient-days. Nonetheless, Won et al.

Globalization has contributed to the fact, that interdependencies in many cases do not require spatial proximity. For example, diseases through aggressive viruses like the avian flu can easily spread to other regions through single contacts. Another example from the thematic area of the decrease of biodiversity, is the involuntary spread of a risk of invasive species (be it animals or plants). On the one hand, expensive measures are taken to preserve the habitats of endangered species in order to protect them from extinction. But then, on the other hand, it can occur that foreign species are introduced involuntarily via global transports, etc. This species then sometimes displaces the ones that have been tried to preserve. This has, for example, happened in the US Great Lakes region with some species of fish through the invasion of zebra mussels and other species through cargo ships. 8 These are only two examples for the various challenges when facing the interdependencies produced through transboundary risks. The level of interdependencies adheres to another problem that is typical for global systemic risks: The ""goods"" (or, as described in this chapter, ""what humans value"") that are endangered through the risk are often common goods, which means that no one can be excluded from its use or profit. Public health is a nonmaterial example for such a common good. The more interdependencies there are within a particular risk situation the smaller is the probability that risk reduction measures are taken. A characteristic of common goods is, that everyone can profit from their use, even if one does not invest in their maintenance. From an individual point of view, a rational actor (be it an individual, a company, a country or any other entity) would act as ""free riders,"" i.e., benefit from the use of the good but not contribute to its maintenance. In terms of risk problems, such an actor would not invest in risk reduction measures, while he would profit from the risk reduction measures conducted by other actors. From a collective point of view, each actor would have been better off had all actors invested in the maintenance of the good. The more interdependencies there are, the less an individual actor feels accountable for investing in risk reduction measures. 9 Weak links between the affected parties contribute to this suboptimal behavior. Anthropogenic climate change through the burning of fossil fuels and the production of greenhouse gases is a classical example, but the depletion of biodiversity can also be understood as a free-rider effect of a global dimension.",23.409544860578066,12.254584187606742

Providing a sustainable, safe, and secure food supply has been a challenging task which requires continuous monitoring of the food quality and quantity from production to consumption. Without an efficacious and productive detectable system, the food supply chain is subjected to contamination. The economies of many countries are dependent on agriculture, and therefore the agriculture sector is an attractive target for deliberate attacks.

Less is known about the number of coronavirus serotypes, and no experimental human vaccines have been evaluated. IFN-a is an antiviral agent that has been effective in both experimental rhinovirus and coronavirus infection [43] [44] [45] , and also has been used effectively as postexposure prophylaxis for natural colds [46, 47] . The utility of IFN-a in normal healthy populations has been limited by its local (nasal) toxicity. Only a single study has evaluated its efficacy for the prevention of respiratory virus infections and the resulting complications in patients with chronic lung disease [48] . No beneficial effects of IFN-a were seen in this population of patients with asthma and COPD; however, the study had insufficient power to demonstrate an effect caused by the prevention of rhinovirus and coronavirus infections. Newer antirhinovirus drugs, such as tremacamra and pleconaril, have recently been shown to have beneficial effects in the treatment of experimental rhinovirus infection [49, 50] , which suggests that there may be a role for these drugs in high-risk populations.

Limited understanding of (1) risk factors for progression to severe LRTI and poor outcomes and (2) indirect inflammatory effects of viral infection impact opinions on appropriate interventions for respiratory viral infections. RV infections, particularly cause by influenza virus, are a risk factor for subsequent bacterial and fungal superinfections. In cases of LRTI, secondary infections must be ruled out and appropriately treated, and initiation of oral or nebulized antifungal prophylaxis to prevent invasive fungal infections should be evaluated in high-risk patients [1, 2, 12] . Management in transplant patients is generally focused on reduction of immunosuppression feasible to speed resolution of viral infection. Treatment options for RVs are limited (Tables 9.2 and 9.4). Resistance patterns may change and affect recommended antiviral strategies. Consequently, clinicians should consult national health authority regularly for updated recommendations, especially for influenza.

Most landmines are located in poor countries, but most landmine clearance is paid for by rich country donors and NGOs. Elliot and Harris (2001) suggest that donors may value the lives saved by clearing mines using standards from their own (rich) countries. Over-valuing saved lives could explain why landmine clearance standards are so strict, requiring 100% removal of mines and UXO (UNMAS, 2003) . This standard favors expensive manual clearance because existing machines cannot find every single mine. In contrast, it is socially efficient to reduce the risk from landmines only to the point where the marginal cost per life saved is the same as for other risk reducing activities (Viscusi, 2000) .",17.864894510759825,7.673412538080285

Chest imaging studies demonstrate patchy infiltrates unrelated to cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Virtually all blood products, including fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells (PRBCs), platelets, granulocytes, cryoprecipitate, intravenous immune globulin, and allogeneic stem cells, have all been implicated in the development of this syndrome [60, 62, 63] . Specific risk factors for TRALI may be stratified according to recipient factors and blood product factors. Recipient factors include hematologic malignancy, critical illness, emergency cardiac surgery, massive transfusion, sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and a high APACHE II scores [64] . General surgery, cytokine infusion, and active infection have also been linked to TRALI, although these associations have not been confirmed. Blood product factors have included transfusions of whole blood and donor gender, with increased rates associated with increased plasma or whole blood from female donors [65] [66] [67] . Numerous studies have explored the influence of RBS storage time on transfusionrelated adverse events, including TRALI and posttransfusion infections, with mixed results [68] [69] [70] . More recent studies suggest that transfusion of fresh (1-10 days old) RBCs does not confer superior transfusion outcomes to the standard practice of transfusing blood stored for up to 3 weeks [71] . Supportive measures, including initiation of supplemental oxygen and hemodynamic support, are the cornerstones of TRALI therapy. Noninvasive respiratory support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is indicated in patients with mild disease. However, approximately 70-80% of patients will require invasive mechanical ventilation [61, 72, 73] . High-dose intravenous steroids have been reported to have success in individual case reports, although no prospective trials exist and existing anecdotal evidence favoring the use of steroids in the management of TRALI is limited [74] . Upon suspicion of TRALI, the transfusion should be immediately discontinued and the blood bank alerted of a possible transfusion reaction. With the recognition that alloimmunization during pregnancy renders multiparous women as high-risk donors in the development of TRALI, national and international risk-reduction strategies have been implemented over the past decade that exclude multiparous women as donors with the preferential utilization of males and nulligravida donors in whole blood and high plasma volume components transfusions [75] [76] [77] [78] . These mitigation strategies do not currently apply to platelet or red blood cell products, due to concerns that broader applications may result in donor shortages of platelets and red blood cell products. Other risk-reduction strategies, including use of solvent-detergenttreated plasma, and more stringent screening of blood and blood product donors have also been implemented. These efforts have resulted in a significant reduction in both TRALI-related incidence and mortality rates.

The use of more plausible VSL measures that would follow from our study increases the importance of human benefits relative to development benefits in assessing targeted clearance.

In 2010, the FAO led an effort to develop the following consensus definition for Sustainable Diets: those diets with low environmental impacts, which contribute to food and nutrition security and to [a] healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources. 99 While elaborate, this definition reflects the important recognition that the health of human beings cannot be isolated from the health of ecosystems. 100 Thus, sustainable diets promote environmental and economic stability through low-impact and affordable, accessible foods, while supporting public health through adequate nutrition. Importantly, sustainable diets help promote sovereignty and preserve tradition involving culturally sensitive and acceptable foods. 101 In order to advance commitments to sustainable diets as a central aspect to sustainable development, one must address the gaps in our understanding of what constitutes a sustainable diet for different populations and contexts. Additionally, it is important to understand how these diets can be assessed within the global food system and how environmental sustainability in global consumption patterns and dietary goals can be achieved. Finally, it is necessary to examine how (sustainable) diets can help transform the health of populations, while promoting economic development and the slowing of environmental degradation. 102 Although many of these processes are underway, they are not yet receiving due political attention or support. This lack of political attention is partly due to the complex web of interactions between food systems, manufacturers, the environment, public health, and consumer behavior and the challenges policy makers face in making appropriate choices whether they are in government, commerce or civil society. 103",12.852107826053834,6.308208651456145

Indeed, in this study, the ratio of mortality comparing the poorest to richest quintile increased for men and decreased for women from 1971 to 1996 for causes of death amenable to medical care. An absolute reduction has greater public health meaning than a relative reduction because of its closer relation to overall health burden. The extent of absolute reductions in mortality between socioeconomic groups is a combination of both the baseline risk and the relative risk reduction. Because poorer quintiles had a higher baseline risk of death than richer quintiles early in the study, they had a greater opportunity to benefit (in absolute terms) from health interventions.

It is not only telling the innovators, but demonstrating it to them with the leasers own decisions and actions. • Actively participating. Innovation is not a steering committee exercise. The innovation leader is one of the innovators actively engaged in the innovation process and work with the team. • Engaged review. Innovation reviews should never be status dumps. They should be truly informative and engage debates on issues, opportunities to improve, changes in constraints, etc., involving the leader and an innovation team peer. • Process breaking. A typical managerial role is to enforce process, standards and limit variability. An innovation leader's role is the exact opposite. Seeking innovation is a de facto admission that current policy and process is not effective or efficient in addressing the problem or opportunity at hand. However organizations are designed around ""make no mistakes"", have no excess capacity, ensure conformance and other dictums that are the antithesis of innovation. The role of the leader is to cut through all those ""good for production efficiency and risk reduction"" rules, policy and process to enable incurring risk, increasing variability, and facilitate learning failure. • Being available. Innovation and addressing wicked problems is an ego bruising, if not busting, exercise in ongoing futility, with success around some distant corner. The leader must motivate the team through this (see next section) but importantly, must be always available to help the team celebrate success, deal with failure, and recognize and appreciate the difference.",12.4259641962419,7.06614221721982

Study participants have learned to be cautious about commitment in romantic relationships and tend to hedge their bets by having multiple partners and various kinds of relationships. Moreover, four contextual factors appear to be critical in limiting condom use: (1) condoms are not always available when passions run high; lack of a condom is often not a barrier to having sex; (2) the decision to use a condom flows from a culturally informed assessment of a partner's presumed level of risk rather than from a public health understanding of risky behaviors; (3) emotional involvement in relationships runs counter to continued condom use; the decision to curtail condom use is made quickly; and (4) relationships in which condoms are not used are multiple, overlapping and sequential. The result is a high level of risk for STD. This risk is not random or meaningless; it is conditioned by socioeconomic factors that press participants to focus on shortterm pleasure and emotional and material gains rather than on long-term planning and monogamous partnerships. It is, in short, a rational response to social disparity. The results of our investigation, however, lead us towards pessimistic conclusions regarding STD prevention and risk reduction behaviors with current methods.

Surprisingly, respondents in the winter sample state a significantly lower financial contribution although avalanche events often occur in this period. From previous analyses it can be inferred that interviewees in winter who consider avalanches as humancaused events state a significantly lower WTP, and that the ''outrage effect'', as discussed in Kahneman et al. (1993) or more recently in Bulte et al. (2005) , is weaker than the ''responsibility effect'' (Walker et al. 1999) for respondents in winter. 23 The lower WTP statements of those who consider avalanches as human-caused events indicate that these respondents are not willing to support risk-reduction programmes in situations where people at risk voluntarily choose their level of risk exposure and, hence, are themselves responsible for their risk experience. This result also indicates that the claim for responsible behaviour outweighs the potential upset (outrage) involved with man-made adverse situations (i.e. those which would not have occurred without human intervention) and the individual's willingness to correct man-made harm accordingly. Once the sample is split into two groups, an interesting pattern concerning these significant variables can be observed.

It has a greater emphasis on health and gives a clearer mandate emphasizing the need for more integrated DRR that incorporates bottom-up as well as top-down approaches, local scientific and technical knowledge, and draws attention to synergies with other critical policy arenas, including health, climate change, and sustainable development. 24 The Sendai Framework captures the developments in science and policy thinking of the last 10-20 years in moving beyond a single hazard and a response-focused approach to disasters, to an all-hazard, preventive, multisector and multidisciplinary approach that links with sustainable economic development and climate change. 25 The Sendai Framework outcome for the next 15 years is to achieve ''The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries''. The following actions with a public health focus are agreed in the Sendai Framework with local, national, regional, and global partners as relevant: ''Enhancing the resilience of national health systems through training and capacity development; strengthening the design and implementation of inclusive policies and social safety-net mechanisms, including access to basic health care services towards the eradication of poverty; finding durable solutions in the post-disaster phase to empower and assist people disproportionately affected by disasters, including those with life-threatening and chronic disease; enhancing cooperation between health authorities and other relevant stakeholders to strengthen country capacity for disaster risk management for health; the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005) and the building of resilient health systems; improving the resilience of new and existing critical infrastructure, including hospitals, to ensure that they remain safe, effective and operational during and after disasters, to provide live-saving and essential services; establishing a mechanism of case registry and a database of mortality caused by disaster to improve the prevention of morbidity and mortality and enhancing recovery schemes to provide psychosocial support and mental health services for all people in need''. 23 The Sendai Framework also recognizes the challenges and gaps: ''Enhanced work to reduce exposure and vulnerability, thus preventing the creation of new disaster risks, and accountability for disaster risk creation are needed at all levels. More dedicated action needs to be focused on tackling underlying disaster risk drivers, such as the consequences of poverty and inequality, climate change and variability, unplanned and rapid urbanization, poor land management and compounding factors such as demographic change''. 23 The Sendai Framework has a strong emphasis on the importance of science as a robust foundation for informing decisionmaking and underpinning DRR. Specific recommendations for the scientific community to improve the understanding of risk and how to achieve its expected outcome of reducing disaster losses in lives, livelihoods, and health include: ''Enhanced scientific and technical work on disaster risk reduction and its mobilization through the coordination of existing networks and scientific research institutions at all levels and all regions, with the support of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction's Scientific and Technical Advisory Group, in order to strengthen the evidence base in support of the implementation of this framework; promote scientific research of disaster risk patterns, causes and effects; disseminate risk information with the best use of geospatial information technology; provide guidance on methodologies and standards for risk assessments, disaster risk modelling and the use of data; identify research and technology gaps and set recommendations for research priority areas in disaster risk reduction; promote and support the availability and application of science and technology to decision-making; contribute to the update of the terminology on disaster risk reduction; use post-disaster reviews as opportunities to enhance learning and public policy and disseminate studies''. 23 The Sendai Framework, when implemented, has the potential to be a truly relevant framework for health, advocating for an allhazards approach.

Consequently, studies specifically addressing risk perception in travelers have been conducted so that the clinician can provide advice that is both meaningful as well as effective in ensuring safe travel [3] .

However, when comparing the exact values of influence of the two network analysis measures, it should be kept in mind that results can be expected to be highly dependent on the cut-offs used in the categorization of these parameters. For BRSV, none of the network analysis parameters were found to be significantly associated when herd size and regional cattle density were accounted for. Nevertheless, these measures could still be useful for risk-based sampling because buying animals can be a risk regardless of whether a herd also has other characteristics associated with disease introduction. This was illustrated in the comparison of selection strategies, where sampling strategies based on 'in-degree' detected more BRSV positives compared to random sampling. In fact, controlling for potential confounders such as herd size may not be appropriate in risk-based sampling, as pointed out by Willeberg and co-authors in this issue of Preventive Veterinary Medicine (Willeberg et al., 2012) . In many European countries, animal movements are continuously recorded, and obtaining network measures for the relevant time period based on these can provide a simple and straight forward tool for risk-based sampling, and also when information about other herd characteristics is missing.

The concept of sustainable diets offers an opportunity for the commitments to sustainable development to the need for improving the quality and environmental sustainability of our food system, especially given the alarming pace of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation (Johnston et al. 2014) .

This would tend to result in behaviour that is sensitive to random events and dependent on the choices of those that first react, but is also sensitive to new information and thus easily reversed (Bikchandani & Sharma, 2001) . Alternatively, the rapid and widespread reduction in travel and tourism, for instance, in SARS affected areas may simply have been the result of large numbers of people making similar decisions given roughly similar data sets.

The aim of our research is to study the psychical health state of the Romanian adults in three counties placed in the middle part of the country. We also have followed the lifestyle and the role of some psychological and social factors. The study is based on a complex questionnaire, which was completed by a representative sample among adult population. After our results depression is the most common psychical illness with 9,1% diagnosis, but in much higher rate exists depressive symptoms. According to Beck score, it was established a significant difference in the favour of female, elderly people, lower educational level, urban population. The percentage of suicide attempt among the studied population was 2,9%. According to WHO Positive life quality test, in two-third majority the adult population consider that it is psychically healthy. In our study it is underlined the role of religious feelings and the importance of health promotion and education to improve the psychical living standards of the population. Malaria is an excellent exemplar for a risk reduction intervention due to geographic fluctuations in its transmission range, lifethreatening consequences, and the vital need for adherence to personal protection measures. This study compared three versions of a web-based game targeting the malaria risk reduction decisionmaking of study abroad students. This population is in jeopardy due to the rapid expansion of programs in malaria endemic regions and the low level of acquired immunity and malaria knowledge among US citizens. Constructs from the self-regulation model and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning informed the creation and evaluation of this game. A three-condition experimental design was used to compare feedback strategies for game decisions: baseline corrective (right/wrong) feedback and explanatory feedback that is either provided automatically with each decision or only when players click on a link to access it. Primary outcome measures were malaria knowledge and player satisfaction. Study abroad email lists at seven Midwestern campuses were used to recruit participants without incentive. Of the 1428 participants who entered the study protocol and were randomly assigned to condition, 918 (64%) completed the pre-survey, 540 (38%) completed the game, and 482 (34%) completed the postsurvey. Only the automatically provided explanatory feedback condition produced a significantly higher knowledge score on the post-test when adjusted for pre-test score. There were no significant differences in player satisfaction between the three feedback conditions, while 65% of participants rated game satisfaction as 'very' to 'extremely' satisfying. Analysis of secondary outcome measures suggests that students prefer simplicity and efficiency within this interactive learning environment. Future research will examine the impact of a risk reduction game intervention on actual behavior. Introduction: Today it is important to maintain and promote mental health, since we are facing a lot of stress experiences. Acupuncture and moxibustion are closely related to behavioral medicine based on preventive medicine. Acupuncture and moxibustion medicine include diagnostic systems which enable us to detect sophisticated changes of the body and the mind as abnormalities of the meridians from a phase of pre-sickness. This study examined relationships between acupuncture and moxibustion medical assessments and perceived mental health states using subscores of Cornell Medical Index(CMI). The CMI used widely in the world was selected as the medical and psychiatric health questionnaire. Method: 235 healthy volunteer college students participated in this study. The cervical meridian test was introduced as a medical diagnosis of acupuncture and moxibustion which is easy to estimate objectively. Subjects were asked whether they felt pain, stretched feeling, dullness or malaise when they flex the neck backward, right side, left side, or forward , as well as perceived mental health using CMI. We compared to mental health related symptoms between individuals with and without perceived pain or stretching by the cervical meridian test. Results: Individuals with such feelings by flexing the neck forward and with such feelings by flexing the neck right and left sides tended to show higher most of scores on mental health related scores. Those with such feelings by flexing the neck backward tended to indicate higher scores on all subscores. Discussion: The cervical meridian test induced ""pain""or ""stretched feeling"" and reflected perceived sensitively reflect mental health states. Acupuncture and moxibustion medical assessment can successfully be applied to mental health domain.

A six-month study was conducted in March to September 2008. Literature reviewing from both national and international articles provided a conceptual framework and a process for developing risk communication model which was preparing, assessing and working with the community. Stakeholders were approached to involve in all steps of the study. The setting of the study was in Mugdhaharn Province, Thailand. The conceptual framework of the risk communication was developed from literature review comprising two major components: 1) risk assessment and 2) risk management. In relation to risk assessment, qualitative and quantitative techniques were applied. The target groups of risk assessment were people at risk of diabetes mellitus, family members, and related persons. The issues to be assessed covered risk factors, risk perception, strengths and weaknesses of self care and risk contexts. The results of the risk assessment led to the guidelines and strategies for coping with the risk factors. Regarding the risk management, the guideline and strategies were initially implemented by focusing on the engagement of the stakeholders which resulted in learning and better understanding among related people. The proposed model reflecting two significant components and its process was accepted by stakeholders and further implemented by local health care team in the study area.

T1-T4 WCR was only predicted by T1-T2 self-efficacy increase (β=−.17, p=.024). One plausible explanation of the results is that agentic women are more successful at weight loss because they are less affected by feminine self-sacrificing role demands. However, also communal women, sensitive to their social environment, succeed well when backed up by social support for their personal goal pursuit. African-Americans experience disparately high rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI); these rates are increasing among rural drug-using communities. However, sexual risk reduction interventions for drug users have traditionally focused on urban populations. We used qualitative techniques to understand rural African-American cocaine users' perspectives on sexual risk and HIV/STI so that we could tailor an existing intervention to this underserved population. Using purposive sampling, 40 African-American cocaine users from two rural towns were recruited to participate in four focus groups, which were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Three investigators coded the data using content analysis and constant comparison. Three major themes emerged: HIV knowledge and beliefs, selling & buying sex, and perceptions of condom use. Participants held many inaccurate beliefs about HIV, including how to identify high-risk partners. Attitudes about HIV testing varied by gender, with women being more accepting; however, most were doubtful about effective HIV treatments. Most participants had complex beliefs about trading sex, with ""survival sex"" seen as acceptable but ""tricking for drugs"" as unacceptable, despite reports that both types were common. Both men and women were socially classified as ""dirty"" or ""nasty"" based in large part on sexual trading behaviors. Participants viewed condoms as protective against HIV and STI, but also reported strong resistance to condom use by both men and women. They reported using hygiene as a proxy for gauging a potential partner's risk and therefore the importance of condom use. Significant knowledge deficits, high-risk beliefs, and social pressures appear to converge on rural African-American cocaine users and contribute to increased HIV and STI rates. These findings were incorporated into a social cognitive theory-based intervention to address these challenges and reduce risk behaviors. The growing amount of youth in the United States living with HIV/AIDS is a persistent problem. Not only has the number of newly infected 15 to 29 year olds consistently increased over the last decade, the emergence of antiretroviral therapy has meant that those born with HIV are growing into adolescence and beyond.",10.671657069736627,6.095416820521024

One hazard factor is the frequency of the hazards about which the EWS warns. A misunderstanding about EWS is that they exist to be activated only when a hazard manifests. According to this myth, the EWS is not needed during periods without the hazard; EWS have nothing that they should or could be doing. The reality is that the EWS should remain an active part of the community at all times. It can be used to educate people about hazards and vulnerabilities, for training about disaster risk reduction and disaster response, to run drills, to gather baseline data, and to further map and update a community's hazards, vulnerabilities, and risks. That is part of the social process of EWS.

The focus of this book is on climate change, but other hazards help to better illustrate and understand EWS in the context of climate change. These include hazards which manifest rapidly, such as tsunamis, as well as creeping hazards which manifest slowly, such as drought. The fundamental tenet is that each EWS needs to be viewed as a social process which often involves technical components embedded in their social context. That leads to a preference for a 'First Mile' approach for designing EWS, which involves communities from the beginning of developing an EWS, rather than a 'Last Mile' approach, which adds people and communities towards the end of the design process. By keeping people and communities at the centre of an EWS from the beginning, the EWS can contribute to daily life and livelihoods, thereby supporting wider disaster risk reduction and sustainable development endeavours, rather than being a separate system waiting to be triggered only when a hazard appears. Yet any EWS has limitations. Those limitations need to be recognised and overcome through other approaches, with possibilities being to consider 'medium warning' and 'late warning' systems rather than just early warning.",17.760969761617197,8.835510392251138

The final RHS term is the indirect effect on risk of the shifts in market supply and demand as a result of the inspection effort. This term includes own price effects that reduce risk, and cross-price effects that have an ambiguous effect on risk. Now consider what happens as the number of source countries and goods gets large. If a country has a large number of trading partners and imports a large number of goods, then it is likely that there will be a close substitute for inspected goods. If the highest probability goods are targeted, then we may expect inspections to induce substitution, i.e., inspections reduce the probability that a pathogen crosses the border and the substitution effect reduces the volume of trade in the risky good. If this were the only effect, then we would expect little welfare loss because a large number of substitutes increases the probability of finding a close substitute. However, as the number of trading partners increases, the differences among the y i 's likely decrease. This implies that the substitute good becomes more likely to also introduce a pathogen (though perhaps a different pathogen). Spillover effects of inspection efforts increase, and targeting risk becomes more complicated with a large number of trading partners and commodities.",13.27892031768479,8.33118113552363

By setting the trigger on an ""event"" rather than an accident or incident, the MEDA process encouraged review of all undesirable outcomes. Also, it allowed the operators to track events that were important to them. Examples of such events included flight cancellation, gate return, and inflight engine shut-down. All the events were associated with actual cost incurred by the air carrier (although the cost varied by company), and therefore the process encouraged the users to consider financial implications of both the errors as well as the solutions. In the decision phase, the operator is expected to determine whether or not the event was maintenance-related; only if it was maintenancerelated, the operator would use the MEDA process further to conduct the investigation. The predeveloped MEDA form guided the investigators in determining the underlying causes of the event and enabled them to determine whether the event occurred due to an error or a violation. According to MEDA, an error is an unintentional human error and a violation is an intentional human action; maintenance-related events can be caused by either errors, violations, or a combination of the two. MEDA also allowed the investigators to consider appropriate prevention strategies. Finally, the feedback phase was intended to communicate back to the workforce the nature of the event, results of the investigation, and strategies to be employed to prevent similar events in the future. As of 2007, Boeing claimed that over 500 of its customer organizations have used MEDA training, and the outcomes ranged from a 16% reduction in delays due to maintenance to 48% reduction in operationally significant events. Thus, MEDA has proven to be an effective tool to mitigate lower-level events and thereby reduce the risk of higher-consequence events (assuming that the contributing factors for both levels of consequences are similar or the same).",12.118975943061178,6.39621432920929

Therefore, if the surplus effects are ignored (i.e., S(x) ¼ 0), then one might reason that the marginal cost of increased inspection, W 0 (e i ) should be set equal to the marginal benefits from reducing risk, @g=@e i for all countries independently. However, the same forces that change demand and supply resulting from the costs imposed by border inspections, also drive changes in m. Assuming market clearing conditions, m ¼ x, importing firms and consumers cause the market to reach a new equilibrium in terms of quantities, x, and prices, given a level of inspection effort. Therefore, the inspection agency's choice of e affects both the cost of inspection and consumer surplus, S, and has both a direct and an indirect effect on the probability of pathogen introduction through g. Fig. 7.4 The market for demand good m i . When inspection on good from country i increase, market price of good i increase too. This leads to customer to look for substitutable goods. And hence demand for x i shifts from d to d 0 ; correspondingly, trade volume decrease from m i to m 0 i It follows that the choice of e has three effects on risk. First, an increase in inspection effort directly reduces that probability that an infectious agent makes it into the country. This reduces the risk of infection. Second, an increase in e i increases the price of x i decreasing the quantity of x i demanded, and therefore the volume of good i imported (m i ). This decrease in m i is expected to reduce risk, all else equal. This implies that a given level of risk reduction may require less inspection effort when the price effects of the inspection program are considered. Third, assuming that goods i and j are substitutes, then an increase in the price of good i will increase the demand for good j from country j. If country j's specific characteristics are such that country j has a significantly higher probability of introducing a pathogen conditional trade volume than country i, then it is possible that increases in e i could actually increase g through g j , consistent with the finding of Kohn and Capen (2002) . The opposite is also true if country j is considerably less risky, since ignoring the substitution effect would result in over-investment in inspection. Therefore, in addition to country specific characteristics, the elasticity of substitution among goods is important for devising efficient border inspection programs.",11.092458482547384,6.154102335957013

High salt intake is estimated to be associated with nearly half of the disease burden ascribed to hypertension, a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. [226] [227] [228] The physiological requirement for salt is less than 1 gram per day, 229 and WHO recommends less than 5 grams per day for adults. 230 Yet, in 2010, the global mean salt intake was twice this level, or 10 grams per person per day. 231 WHO's Global Action Plan has set a target of a 30% reduction of population-level salt intake by 2025. 232 Population salt reduction is among WHO's so-called best-buys to reduce chronic disease-an intervention that could lead to substantial health benefits as well as cost savings. 233, 234 In the USA, it has been estimated that a regulatory intervention designed to achieve a reduction in salt intake of 3 grams per day would save 194 000 to 392 000 quality-adjusted life-years and US$10-24 billion in health-care costs annually, and would be more costeffective than using medications to lower blood pressure in all people with hypertension. 235 From a population perspective, the most effective and equitable means of reducing salt consumption is to reduce the salt content of manufactured foods. 236, 237 In many countries, processed foods substantially contribute to salt intake, 238 regardless of any action individuals might take to reduce the salt they add to food. Countries are adopting population-level salt reduction strategies to achieve WHO's 30% reduction target by 2025. Many of these focus on reductions at the manufacturing level (reformulation), complemented by public information campaigns and nutrition labelling. The strategies also use diverse regulatory forms. In 2006, the UK became the first country to set salt targets for food composition. Using a voluntary approach, but with strong government leadership and oversight, UK manufacturers agreed to progressive reduction targets for around 80 categories of processed foods. Their reformulation efforts were supported by consumer education and improved food labelling. The approach was highly successful, resulting in a 15% decrease in salt intake across the population. 239 South Africa was the first country to set legislatively mandated salt reduction requirements across a wide range of processed foods. In March 2013, the South African Minister of Health issued the Regulations Relating to the Reduction of Sodium in Certain Foodstuffs and Related Matters. 240 The requirements took effect on June 30, 2016, with more stringent maximum levels coming into force on June 30, 2019. 240 Argentina has used a combination of voluntary and mandatory salt reduction techniques. Initially, the Ministry of Health and large food companies signed a voluntary agreement in 2011 to gradually and progressively reduce sodium in processed foods. 241 Voluntary targets were set according to the category of food, with reductions ranging between 5-18% over a 2-year period, and a government campaign supporting and encouraging behaviour change. In 2013, to build on the success achieved through the voluntary scheme, Argentina enacted a national law regulating the sodium content of processed foods. As of 2019, 83 countries have salt reduction strategies in place or planned, including 35 countries with voluntary targets and nine with mandatory, legislated targets. Almost all countries use a multifaceted regulatory approach, with 70 counties implementing, or planning to implement more than one type of strategy, and 33 countries incorporating legislative initiatives such as taxes, maximum limits, or warning labels. 242 Programmes are now being implemented in countries across all WHO regions and across countries with a broad range of income levels. 242 An example of these changes is described in the case study of the regulation of sugar-sweetened beverages (panel 7).",10.358585889223066,5.992028857548034

These findings are consistent with previous studies of coronavirus disinfection, but this study provides more precise estimates of inactivation on surfaces than have been previously observed with other human coronaviruses, such as 229E. Some previous studies of chemical disinfection of 229E have been limited by cytotoxicity problems that limited the ability to measure infectious virus reduction. 25 Sattar et al 26 found that 70% ethanol reduced human coronavirus 229E dried onto a stainless steel surface by .99.9%. This study shows that the actual reduction is slightly greater than 3-log 10 (3.9 for TGEV and 3.19 for MHV).

The total dosage of antibiotics received were also significantly lesser in procalcitonin group (4.4 ± 6.2 vs. 12.92 ± 6.7; p < 0.001). Even at 6 weeks, the mean days of antibiotic exposure was significantly lower in the procalcitonin group (3 ± 5.63 vs. 10.42 ± 5.59; p < 0.001) as was the mean total dosage of antibiotics received(5.18 ± 8.09 vs. 16.7 ± 8.06; p < 0.001). There also was significant risk reduction of antibiotic exposure (71.2%). The inter group statistical analysis was done using Chi-square and ANOVA test with p value £0.05 considered as significant. Both the groups were well matched in their demographic and clinical profiles. The mean length of hospital stay was no different (7.5 ± 2.5 vs. 7.3 ± 2.3; p = 0.780) in either group. The clinical improvement, lung functions, usage of steroids, non invasive ventilator support and other supportive therapies were similar in both the groups. Conclusion: Serum procalcitonin serves as a good and reliable biomarker to differentiate between bacterial and non bacterial exacerbations of COPD and thus guides the usage of antibiotics. It is likely to have a tremendous impact on economic burden of the disease, specifically in resource limited settings, in a country like India. Objectives: Findings from a previous hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) study indicated that efficacy of tigecycline (TGC) 50 mg q12h was lower than that of imipenem-cilastatin (IMI), especially in subjects with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of two higher TGC dosage regimens with an IMI regimen in HAP subjects. Methods: In this Phase 2, multicentre, double-blind study, subjects with HAP (stratified VAP and non-VAP) were randomized to one of three treatment arms: TGC 75 mg q12 hour; TGC 100 mg q12 hour; or IMI 1 g q8 hour and received treatment for up to 14 days. The primary and secondary endpoints were the clinical response in clinically evaluable (CE) and clinical modified intent-to-treat (c-mITT) populations at test-of-cure (TOC), respectively. Results: Of 105 subjects who received study drugs, 67 subjects (63.8%) were clinically evaluable. The median age of subjects was 64 years, 68% were male, 39% had VAP, 30% had an APACHE II score >15, 20% were prior antibiotic failures, and median therapy duration was 8 days. Clinical responses are shown in the table below. Eighty-six (82%) subjects reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The most frequently reported TEAEs, gastrointestinal disorders (incidence, 37%) had a numerically higher incidence in the TGC 100 mg group (43%). Serious AEs of sepsis/septic shock were numerically higher in the TGC 75 mg (n = 5) than TGC 100 mg (n = 2) and IMI (n = 2) groups. Seventeen deaths occurred in 7 (19.4%), 3 (8.6%), and 7 (20.6%) subjects who received TGC 75 mg, TGC 100 mg, and IMI respectively.",10.532932416929455,5.886936348395325

To compare OA ventilation in each location directly to HVAC filtration, OA ventilation rates have been adjusted to achieve the same removal rate as that of each level of HVAC filtration. For example, a MERV 15 filter is expected to achieve 1.37 per hour in infectious droplet nuclei removal in the office environment with the mean assumption for infectious particle size distributions; for outdoor air ventilation to achieve the same risk reduction as filtration, the office HVAC system would need to provide 1.37 additional air changes per hour of outdoor air ventilation. Therefore, OA ventilation and HVAC filtration can be thought of as equivalent in terms of risk reduction (on the y-axis), but will differ in their cost estimates (on the x-axis). For each of the four geographic locations, the cost per unit ($ per 1/hr) ventilation energy costs from Table 5 was used to estimate the cost of providing this equivalent reduction.",24.250647472680726,9.104754291543752

MERV 13 and MERV 14 filters appear to achieve an optimal combination of lowest risk reductions at least costs. MERV 4 is actually more expensive to operate than providing equivalent outdoor air ventilation in each climate, primarily because of the very low effectiveness in controlling infectious aerosols. HEPA filtration appears to offer only a small incremental advantage over MERV 13e16 filters (i.e., 1e4% lower RR) for as much as 1.6e2.3 times the cost of operation, which suggests that MERV 13e16 filters may be most appropriate for cost-effectively reducing risks of influenza transmission in this particular indoor environment.

In summary, these strategies involve exposure reduction through source reduction, containment of hazard through the use of modern equipment and engineering controls, and barrier protection with personal protective equipment. The Mus m 1 allergen load in the environment is markedly increased when male mice are used in studies due to the fact that they excrete 4-fold higher levels of allergen in the urine than do female mice (Lorusso et al. 1986 ). Therefore, sources have recommended, that whenever scientifically possible, use of only female mice would be a means of reducing allergen load in the environment and minimizing the exposure of personnel (Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health 1997; Renstrom et al. 2001 ). Furthermore Renstrom et al. (2001) reported a three-fold higher rate of allergic sensitization in technicians who worked with male rodents. Although this approach may be useful in a few studies, this method of source reduction would appear to have only very limited applicability across the broad scope of contemporary studies using mouse models. Source reduction of mouse allergen is also achieved through reduction of animal density within an animal room (the number of animals per room volume) and through use of frequent, effective facility sanitation practices (Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health 1997).",11.10084011530763,5.319837039029202

Although China has a strong central government, provincial and lower levels of government enjoy a great deal of autonomy, which has resulted in a mixed response and inconsistent enforcement of HIV/AIDS policy.

In ancient and medieval times, disaster was considered the divine realm of God. Ancient human societies considered praying to God the only way to ward off disaster, and when a force majeure did occur, it was seen as God's punishment for sinful or disrespectful behavior. During such historical catastrophic epics like Noah's Great Flood, the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64, and the Black Death in medieval Europe, tens of thousands of people perished; however, neither the government nor the people contemplated the root causes of the disaster.

The effects of fungal infection on the allograft have been less frequently studied than those of viral or bacterial infections. Valentine et al. identified fungal pneumonia as a significant risk factor for subsequent BOS [17] . Recent intriguing evidence from Weigt et al. has demonstrated that aspergillus colonization, even in the absence of invasive infection, is a risk factor for BOS and BOS-related mortality, independent of acute rejection [66] . Aspergillus colonization preceded BOS by a median of 261 days in this study [66] . However, neither fungal colonization nor pulmonary fungal infection was identified as a risk factor for chronic allograft dysfunction in a study of 55 pediatric lung recipients by Liu et al.

It would be of interest to determine whether there are differential effects of different antifungal prophylaxis strategies. The changing landscape of antifungal prophylaxis, particularly the shift towards voriconazole and away from itraconazole, is of interest [69, 70] . Although antifungal prophylaxis has traditionally been undertaken with a goal of preventing invasive fungal infection, perhaps the results of Weigt et al. (described above) will prompt reassessment of current antifungal prophylaxis strategies with an eye to decreasing colonization as well. In particular, it could be asked if the addition or substitution of inhaled amphotericin or liposomal amphotericin preparations [71, 72] might lead to decreased airway fungal colonization compared with systemic-only antifungal strategies, and long-term benefits to the allograft should be further explored.",9.302137119116718,3.720402705559946

Many times these are disease prevention and control strategies, such as vaccination and treatment of individuals or populations, or personal protective measures, such as wearing gloves and masks for humans facing zoonotic diseases. The idea is to rerun the model under different conditions or assumptions to see how the risk changes in response to intervention actions. Sensitivity analysis-the process of examining the impact of the variation in individual model inputs on the model outputs in a quantitative risk assessment-is often performed to accomplish this. Many times, cost is entered into the equation as well in order to conduct cost-benefit analyses of different management options. The result is a very powerful tool for management authorities to analyze not only risk, have little evidence-based information for pathogenesis in captive wildlife, or for how transmission may occur across the species barriers. This is another large data gap that affects the consequence assessment and presents further opportunity to support research on both the ecology and pathogenesis of these agents beyond the normal domestic animal realm. There is evidence that there is some level of risk of RVF transmission to US livestock from the importation of wildlife species. While the number of imports that are most likely to provide a risk of RVF transmission are relatively few compared to the overall large volume of imports, the consequences of a transmission event would be extensive.

The dilution effect is proposed to reduce infection transmission with increased biodiversity through a reduction in vector-host interactions. However, a simple model suggests that with increased encroachment and human population growth, reduced biodiversity loss might not actually lead to a reduction in spillover potential and could instead increase the potential of emergent diseases, if risk scales with biodiversity (Fig 2A and C) . This would suggest that if we wish to maintain biodiversity as well as mitigate infection emergence, we need to address what is happening at the interface between humans and the rest of the natural world. Science from all disciplines will be needed, and society will decide which approaches will be taken. P reventing infection emergence events while maintaining ecological health will require significant funding and commitment.

The West African Ebola virus pandemic has directly killed more than 11,000 people, infected over 28,000 and cost over US$2.2 billion in losses and possibly much more in the future. Indirect costs through interrupted education, cessation of immunization and other disease control campaigns, and the loss of many qualified local healthcare workers are yet to be determined. Clearly, lowering the risk of such outbreaks will be financially beneficial, as even many hundreds of millions of dollars spent to prevent such an outbreak would lead to beneficial benefit/cost ratios, even without the additional benefits of improved ecosystems and sustainable natural forest product use.",12.441279713485866,7.241242013832906

Thus, although there is considerable common ality in the research priorities of each group, some biological threats, such as anthrax and plague, are cur rently seen as being more relevant to the military. In addition, the nature of the work undertaken by the mili tary and the environment in which it operates are likely to influence how and when MCMs are administered. For example, the military may consider immunizing troops with a new vaccine prior to deployment as the most effective means of protecting individuals and ensuring operational effectiveness in a high-risk environment. In contrast, the civilian authorities are more likely to treat with antibiotics after an outbreak has occurred rather than vaccinate large numbers of the public against a disease with a very low likelihood of a deliberate release (albeit very high impact), such as anthrax.",16.047648144120302,9.180508477811031

The concept of treatment as prevention is a hot issue among HIV/AIDS researchers. An ecological study showed a strong association between HAART coverage and the number of new HIV diagnoses. 4 Furthermore, a recent randomized study indicated that early antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive individuals can significantly reduce sexual transmission of HIV for discordant couples in the heterosexual population. 5 Nevertheless, most developed countries with free HAART are facing a resurgence of HIV infections in MSM. 6 In response to this challenge, positive prevention has gradually gained more attention as a HIV control strategy, particularly since the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched the Sero-status Approach to Fighting the HIV Epidemic program (SAFE) for people with HIV. 7 The SAFE approach seeks to: (1) encourage HIVinfected persons to know their serostatus; (2) increase the use of health care and preventive services; (3) increase high-quality care and treatment; (4) increase adherence to antiretroviral therapy; and (5) encourage individuals with HIV to adopt HIV/sexually-transmitted disease (STD) risk reduction behaviors. 7 In addition, this program stresses that reduction in stigmatization must be integrated into strategies to avoid blaming an already stigmatized group. 7 Regarding the HAART effect on the HIV epidemic among MSM in Taiwan, although serological testing algorithms such as the BED HIV-1 capture enzyme immunoassay can provide exact estimates of HIV incidence, national surveillance of Taiwan was not implemented until 2010. Therefore, an alternative method proposed by Cowan and her colleages was adopted to evaluate the effect of HAART on HIV trends among MSM: a ratio between the yearly number of new reported cases and the number of MSM living with HIV was used. 8 Fig. 2 shows HIV transmission rates among MSM with HIV in Taiwan. After HAART implementation, HIV transmission rates dropped from 35% in 1997 to 16% in 2005, and continued to decrease more slowly toward 15% until 2011. This suggests that universal HAART for the infected had an immediate effect on HIV transmission rates. However, elimination of the residual rate is more difficult and will require complex efforts.",11.590131666355783,8.211478248370398

Drug resistant infections may already cause 700,000 deaths per year and it is estimated that 10 million deaths due to AMR may occur every year after 2050 [49] . Vaccines can impact antibiotic-resistant infections through a direct reduction in the resistant organisms and strains that are specifically targeted by the vaccine, as well as through a reduction in common illnesses that often lead to the use of antibiotics and therefore selection pressure on pathogens [50] . The widespread use of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal vaccines have resulted in a dramatic reduction in disease burden and have been associated with decreased incidence of resistant strains. Universal coverage with pneumococcal vaccination could potentially avoid more than 11 million days of antibiotic use per year in children under 5 [51, 52] . A newer typhoid conjugate vaccine has a potential for high impact on prevention and control of antimicrobial resistant typhoid fever and was recently strategically used to control an extensively drug resistant typhoid outbreak in Pakistan [53] . But vaccines against viruses, e.g., influenza, can also exert a major impact here, due to the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. Vaccines offer a more sustainable approach to infection prevention, since pathogen resistance to vaccines is uncommon [51] . The equitable use of vaccines is expected to avert substantial parts of the AMRrelated fraction of disease, reduce antibiotic use, and-together with other interventions across human and animal health-add to the reduction in the economic and societal burden of AMR [54] .",10.277741636442865,7.421563208066129

Individual bundle elements are built on evidence-based practice, and the bundle concept is that when these elements are executed together they produce better outcomes than in isolation. There is, however, limited evidence linking the use of bundles to demonstrable changes in patient outcomes. As a preliminary analysis to inform a multicentre evaluation, we explored the effect of the introduction of the 'ventilator bundle' on the outcomes for mechanically ventilated patients in a single critical care unit. Methods Data were extracted for mechanically ventilated admissions from a single unit participating in the Case Mix Programme that was an early adopter of the ventilator bundle. A risk prediction model was developed using data from admissions during the 3.5 years prior to the introduction of the bundle and applied to admissions during the 3 years since introduction to estimate the cumulative excess mortality (observed minus expected deaths). Results There were 762 ventilated admissions prior to the introduction of the bundle and 618 since. The cumulative excess mortality plot suggested a reduction in mortality after introduction of the bundle (Figure 1 ) but this was not statistically significant (relative risk reduction 10.9%, 95% confidence interval -10.2% to 31.8%).",14.754924037950722,7.3835989759505996

We systematically evaluated these factors to assist development of locally appropriate strategies to mitigate disease risk. Wild dogs from 16 sites representing five unconnected populations were examined for rabies virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and Babesia spp. exposure. Analyses revealed widespread exposure to viral pathogens, but Babesia was never detected. Exposure to CDV was associated with unprotected and protected-unfenced areas where wild dogs likely have a high probability of domestic dog contact and, in the case of protected-unfenced areas, likely reside amongst high wildlife densities. Our findings also suggest that domestic dog contact may increase rabies and coronavirus exposure risk. Therefore, domestic dogs may be a source of CDV, rabies and coronavirus, while wildlife may also play an important role in CDV transmission dynamics. Relatively high parvovirus seroprevalence across land-use types suggests that it might persist in the absence of spillover from domestic dogs. Should intervention be needed to control pathogens in wild dogs, efforts to prevent rabies and coronavirus exposure might be directed at reducing infection in the presumed domestic dog reservoir through vaccination. If prevention of CDV and parvovirus infections were deemed a management necessity, control of disease in domestic dogs may be insufficient to reduce transmission risks, and vaccination of wild dogs themselves may be the optimal strategy.",10.35937402658614,5.452915521507793

Identifi cation of high-risk recipients is recommended, specifi cally EBVseronegative recipients and those at risk for CMV disease. Avoidance of overzealous immunosuppression should be encouraged as well, because this has been shown to be a risk factor for development of PTLD. The benefi t of antiviral prophylaxis specifi cally targeted toward EBV has not been established, but CMV prophylaxis regimens may have some benefi t in reducing the risk for PTLD. The use of prophylactic CMV intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) did not prove effi cacious in a small clinical trial. 32 Treatment of early PTLD begins with reduction of immunosuppression, which may result in spontaneous regression in 23% to 50% of cases. In renal transplant patients, confi rmed PTLD should prompt cessation of immunosuppression, even at the expense of rejection of the allograft. Retransplantation after recovery from PTLD is possible, with a recent OPTN/ UNOS database study showing retransplantation patient survival of 100% and graft survival of 88.9% at a mean follow-up of 742 ± 107 days. 33 Other treatment modalities include surgical debulking of the tumor or explant of the allograft, if involved; referral to an oncologist for monoclonal B-cell antibody therapy (rituximab) if the tumor cells are CD20ϩ; and cytotoxic chemotherapy for refractory disease. A variety of other treatment modalities are under investigation, including anti-interleukin-6, interferon alfa, and adoptive immunotherapy using the patient's own lymphocytes activated ex vivo. 27 Late-onset or EBV-negative PTLD typically does not respond as well to reduction of immunosuppression and thus requires more aggressive therapeutic measures, so early consultation with an oncologist is prudent in these patients.",11.334283764257316,6.968286569200952

Under such a situation, the negative impacts of such developments seem to be greater. Finding the financial resources to support tourism firms and establish marketing strategies seems to be as important as having plans and teams. Looking at the record of past crises, it is certain that other ones in and around Turkey will occur. Therefore, it would be sensible to set up a national tourism crisis fund.

Yet, no country has a national pneumonia control strategy and pneu monia attracts a small fraction of international development assistance and research and development funding. 2 Several global initiatives have sought to fill this gap and provide guidance on the most efficient interventions to avert illness and mortality and to champion LRI as a pre ventable cause of death. [2] [3] [4] [5] These programmes have typically categorised risk factors and interventions into groups that are defined by the stage in the morbidity pathway at which they occur, including protection against illness, prevention of infection, and treatment of disease. 4, 5 The decline in under5 LRI mortality has not been universal and has varied between countries. 6 Under standing why it declined faster in some countries than in others provides specific, actionable evidence to further reduce disease burden. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) is a systematic, scientific effort to quantify morbidity and mortality, including LRIs and their risk factors. We used results from GBD 2017 to assess which countries have performed best in reducing under5 LRI mortality and compare countries on the basis of mortality rates, case fatality, and changes in risk factor exposure.

Similarly, the potential role of pathogenic fungi in HBS warrants careful consideration when designing preventive strategies. In short, until more defined information regarding the cause of HBS is published, it may be best to first consider all proposed causes or risk factors (e.g., anaerobic bacteria, fungi, and reduced host disease resistance) and take measures to mitigate these potential risk factors. In so doing, one should consider (1) identifying and correcting management and environmental factors that might impair cow immunity, (2) performing a careful partial budget analysis of the cost of specific preventive measures, and (3) deciding on which specific corrective measure(s) might be most justified for a particular dairy.",11.190236988862734,6.3587922375600865

But given the dramatic external forces in nature, politics and health which are leading to new levels of uncertainty in the ecological and societal realms, they see the need for 'a radical departure from the inside-out perspective of environmental management and its more systems theory-informed cousin from sustainability management' to one where sustainability management should be 'expanded and complemented, and may even need to be substituted by conceptual frameworks fairly new to organization theories, such as ""resilience management"" or ""discontinuity management""' (Winn and Kirchgeorg, 2005: 250) . This is because if we are facing significant shifts in environmental and political conditions, the balancing nature of sustainable development will no longer apply in an unstable world. Rather, business will need to take on board the possibility or probability of structural shifts and the prospect of facing several global emergencies during their lifetime. 'Since ecological global systems cannot be affected significantly by actors in the short-term (the inside-out approach), broader adaptive behaviors that secure the survivability of the economy and society become increasingly relevant.

Whether this inflammation is the result of such infections, it appears very likely that a persistent inflammatory environment is the underlying cause of progression to CLAD. Despite the significant immunosuppression postlung transplantation, a tremendous inflammatory environment is found during ACR, and after CARV in the form of DAD. Findings with both Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, and perhaps with viruses, do suggest that the underlying allograft inflammatory milieu is at least as important a determinant of the graft fate as is the infection. Pathogen-specific prophylactic interventions may be effective at reducing their occurrence posttransplantation and their impact on CLAD, such as with CMV. Yet, while prophylactic strategies that reduce Aspergillus colonization rates exist, the impact of these interventions on subsequent development of CLAD remains to be determined. Targeted antibiotic therapy, whether inhaled or systemic, or surgical intervention, such as sinus surgery, may help to reduce the burden of bacterial colonization in those colonized, but such strategies are unlikely to have great impact upon those not already colonized. The etiology of CARV is so diverse as to preclude the use of virus-specific interventions to prevent allograft damage and therefore CLAD. Thus, identifying LTR at greatest risk for infections that predispose to CLAD should be a priority, along with appropriate risk reduction strategies, such as via individualized immunosuppression. Further studies are required to illuminate the mechanisms by which infectious organisms promote the generation of CLAD, allowing us to implement novel therapies directed not solely at the pathogen, but simultaneously at deleterious allograft responses to these pathogens.",18.772959386458055,11.609250456395268

Although it is important to explain that the best way to avoid infections is to not handle animals and to limit one's exposure to animal blood and body fluids, for many people, hunting and butchering represent an essential part of daily food preparation. Thus, the focus of this intervention is on reducing the risk of zoonotic infection and not necessarily the practice of bushmeat hunting itself.

Although these solutions will be targeted to specific country or regional contexts, they are likely to be bolstered by broader investment in health security-and the resulting avoidance of disease and economic consequences-as a global public good for both new epidemics and the endemic diseases they can ultimately become. Better consideration of EID risk under a One Health lens can thus advance key international initiatives, such as the GHSA, which emphasizes multisectoral solutions to strengthen preparedness capacity for prevention, detection, and response to biological threats.

We extend prior literature by introducing the novel finding that 30-day RSRRs for elderly Medicare beneficiaries have a significant association with the risk of readmission for younger patients for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. This finding has several important implications. First, because other insurers beyond Medicare are concerned with reducing readmissions, understanding the mechanisms by which hospitals with low 30-day RSRRs achieve reduced readmissions across the spectrum of age is an important step in designing and implementing readmission reduction programs more broadly. One possible mechanism may include similar patterns and timing of readmission. 24, 36 Second, there may be substantial costs associated with reducing a hospital's RSRR in elderly patients. 37 On the basis of our findings, a reduction in a hospital's RSRR by 1 percentage point is associated with an approximately 5% reduction in the relative probability of readmission and a smaller reduction in the absolute risk among younger patients across all 3 conditions.

A higher prevalence of positive TST reaction was found among participants working in the surgical ward (79.9%; OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.50-4.44) than in the medical ward (69.1%), and nurses (75.5%; OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.14-4.06) than clerks (71%), receptionist (68.8%), and administrative personnel (58.9%). Presence of BCG scar was not significantly associated with positive TST response. Among 114 employees with a negative TST reaction who underwent a second test, the booster reaction was found in 12 (10.5%). In 2003, conversion was found in 10 (16.3%) of 61 participants. Conversion was not significantly associated with any of the variables examined. Conclusion: In high TB prevalence countries, HCWs are increased risk for the infection. The effect of previous BCG vaccination on the result of TST was minimal, and positive response to TST was related to natural infection rather than previous vaccination. Our study supports the CDC recommendations, which emphasize that screening of HCWs with TST is beneficial to evaluate TB exposure and is suitable for high TB prevalence countries too. The nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a group of bacteria that can cause pulmonary and systemic diseases. An increased risk of NTB infections is more frequent in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-negative patients suffering from immunosuppression due to previous pulmonary disease, old age and alcoholism. For the rapid detection and identification of mycobacteria new strategies have been developed. These novel methods such as HPLC, the BACTEC NAP test and commercial DNA probes are recommended for identification of NTM species. Recently, a new molecular test based on the PCR technique and reverse hybridization procedure has been introduced for simultaneous identification of different mycobacterial species.",5.779831586038664,6.436078550631263

We investigated whether the same beneficial effects could be reported for patients in a hospital in the Netherlands by conducting a single blind, randomized controlled trial. Methods: Patients hospitalized in the Isala klinieken in Zwolle, the Netherlands, with a bacterial infection confirmed by culture were randomly assigned to a control or to an intervention (rapid) group. As is customary practice, the clinical microbiologists orally reported clinically relevant information to the clinician for all patients. For all patients complete culture results were reported on paper. For identification and susceptibility testing overnight methods were used in the control group. In the rapid group the Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was used. In each of the three consecutive study periods accelerating factors were added in a step-up manner to the laboratory workflow of the rapid group, such as increasing oral reporting, extending the working day and adding an extra hard-copy report delivery. The workflow for the control group remained identical throughout the study. We analysed whether the turnaround time to reporting was shortened by using the Vitek 2 system and additional factors, and assessed the effects of a shortened turnaround time in terms of mortality, morbidity and cost for (i) the overall patient group and (ii) a subgroup of patients with bacteraemia Results: For the overall patient group (n = 1870), the time interval to oral reporting of final susceptibility results was significantly shorter for the rapid groups in all three-study periods, the time to reporting on paper was significantly shorter in the third period. For the subgroup of patients with bacteraemia (n = 183) a similar shortening of turnaround times was found. For neither the overall patient group nor the subgroup a significant difference in any of the clinical impact variables or a cost reduction was found. Conclusion: Although the turnaround time to reporting of microbiology results was shortened significantly for both the overall patient group and the subgroup of bacteraemic patients, in our hospital setting no clinical impact or cost reduction could be reported as a result.",5.1361955038564755,5.479841690376408

In Taiwan, diabetes mellitus has emerged as an overwhelming risk factor for PLA, whereas epidemiologic studies on diabetes as a risk factor for PLA in Western populations are sparse. Methods: We examined diabetes as a risk factor and prognostic factor for PLA in Denmark during a 26-year period, using a large nationwide data set based on administrative registries. We identified all patients with a diagnosis of PLA in the National Registry of Patients, and randomly selected fifty gender-and age-matched population controls for each case. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for PLA according to diabetes, adjusted for medical and surgical risk factors. Among patients with PLA, we compared adjusted mortality odds ratios in diabetic and other patients. Results: The study included 1448 patients with a first hospitalisation with PLA between 1977 and 2003. The median age (range) was 65 (0-97) years, and 54% were men. A total of 11.1% of the patients with PLA had diabetes recorded before or on the matching date, compared with 2.5% of control subjects. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the OR for PLA in persons with diabetes was 4.0 (95% CI: 3.3-4.8). At 30 days after discharge, the mortality was 24.8% for diabetic patients and 18.0% for non-diabetic patients with PLA. The adjusted mortality odds ratio in diabetic patients was 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.9). Conclusion: In this nationwide study, we found a fourfold increased risk and a poorer outcome of PLA associated with diabetes mellitus. Objective: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a major complication of liver cirrhosis. There are few data about prognostic significance of bacteremia in patients with SBP. So we performed a retrospective study to determine the influence of bacteremia on the mortality of patients with SBP. Methods: All patients with SBP, in whom the microorganism was isolated from ascites and/or blood, were identified by retrospective review of clinical and laboratory records in Seoul National University Hospital in Korea from January 2002 to December 2004. They were classified into the bacteremic group and non-bacteremic group. The underlying liver function was determined by MELD (Model for End-stage Liver disease) score. Microbiologic response rate, ascites polymorphonuclear leukocyte count reduction rate, and SBP-related mortality were compared between the two groups. To identify the independent risk factors of mortality, a multiple logistic regression model was used to control for the effects of confounding variables. Results: A total of 203 patients were enrolled in this study. Among 203 patients, 116 (57.1%) were bacteremic, and 87 (42.9%) non-bacteremic. Escherichia coli was the most common etiologic organism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The distribution of etiologic organisms was not different between the two groups. Stratified MELD scores showed no significant difference between the two groups. Microbiologic response rate (64.7% versus 74.7%, p > 0.05), and ascites polymorphonuclear leukocyte count reduction rate (34.3% versus 43.3%, p > 0.05) were not different between bacteremic and non-bacteremic group. But SBP-related mortality of bacteremic groups was significantly higher than that of non-bacteremic group (31% versus 8%, p < 0.001).Bacteremia (OR, 5.8; 95% CI. 1.9-16.9; p < 0.01) and MELD score (OR, 2.4; 95% CI. 1.1-5.1; p = 0.017) were independent risk factors in multiple logistic regression analyses of SBP related mortality. Conclusion: Bacteremia is an independent risk factor of mortality in SBP. Objective: Etiological analysis of sputum culture regarding seasonal fluctuations in family practitioners' patients. Methods: The study group included both primary care (207) and clinically diagnosed patients (50) who had their sputum examination ordered and then performed in Silesian Analytic Laboratories in the2000-05 period. All subjects were registered in the family practise or hospitalised in the Silesian area. The including criteria were active infections of lower respiratory tract. The intake, transport and final identification of the material complied with laboratory standards. Results: Number of positive cultures of all sputum samples taken from both primary care and hospitalised patients accounted for 77% and 68%, respectively. The most common pathogens of primary care patients were, in order of prevalence (excluding Streptococcus viridans): Moraxella catarrhalis (57%), E.coli 21%, Staph.aureus 11%, Klebs.pneumoniae 10%, Pseud. Aeruginosa 6%, Proteus mirabilis 4%. In clinically diagnosed patients these were: Moraxella catarrhalis 33%, Klebs. pneum. 22%, E coli 19%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 19%, Staph.aureus 11%, Str. spp. 11%, Str. pneumonicae 7%. As for any seasonal fluctuations among primary care patients the higher number of positive samples was noted in April and October (15%), the least in June, July and August (3%).The results of our detailed analysis of primary care samples showed the higher percentage of Moraxella catarrhalis strains in Dec. (77%) and Jan.(75%) and the least in May (20%). In the other months it ranged from 50 to 60%. The higher percentage of E.coli isolates (70%) was observed in May, while in Mar., Jun. and Dec. they were absent. As for Staphylococcus aureus the most frequent detection was stated in Mar. and Dec.27% and 31%, respectively), whereas they did not emerge in summer months (from June to Sep.). The higher emergence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in June (20%) while Klebs. pneumoniae isolates tested positively mainly during the spring and summer period (10-20%).",5.589113323415608,5.134835095190855

Systematic reviews have documented no adequately powered studies in primary care to assess independent predictors of rigorous laboratory diagnosis, nor robustly estimated the performance of urinary dipsticks in a typical primary care population. Our aim was to estimate independent clinical and dipstick predictors of infection and develop clinical decision rules. Methods: 427 women presenting with suspected UTI in primary care had laboratory diagnosis assessed using the European Urinalysis guidelines standard. Independent clinical and dipstick predictors of diagnosis were estimated. Results: 62.5% of women had confirmed UTI. Only nitrite, leukocyte esterase (+ or greater), and blood (haemolyzed trace or greater) independently predicted diagnosis (multivariate odds ratios respectively 6. 36,4.52,2,23) . A dipstick rule -based on having nitrite, or both leukocytes and blood was moderately sensitive (77%) and specific (70%) (positive predictive value (PPV) 81%, negative predictive value (NPV) 65%). Predictive values were improved by varying the cut point: the NPV was 73% for all three-dipstick results being negative; the PPV 92% for having nitrate and either blood or leukocyte esterase. A 'clinical rule' based on having 2 of urine cloudiness, offensive smell, reported moderately severe dysuria, moderately severe nocturia -was less sensitive (65%) (Specificity 69%, PPV 77%, NPV 54%). The NPV was 71% for none of the four clinical features, and the PPV 84% for 3 or more features. Conclusion: Simple decision rules could improve targeting of investigation or treatment. Strategies to use such rules will need to take account of their limited sensitivity, which is lower than expected from previous research.",3.6641424570806733,4.754210717083491

The purpose of this study was to survey the incidence and the site of infection and to define risk factors for infection and mortality in ICU admittedmultiple trauma patients. Methods: Prospective record for APACHE II score day by day was conducted for all multiple trauma patients who were admitted at surgical ICU of Ajou university hospital from June 1. 2002 1. to May 30. 2004 . Patients who were transferred from other hospitals after operation, or for more than 48 hours care or under the age of 18 were excluded. We reviewed medical records and all imaging studies retrospectively. Results: A total of 108 patients (81 males) with mean age of 41 years (± 14 years) were included and their mean APACHE II score was 27.5 (± 18.9). Most common cause of trauma was blunt injuries (83 patients, 76.9 %) like traffic accidents and fall down. A total of 60 infections had occurred in 44 (40.7%) patients for an incidence of 12.5/1000 patient-days. The sites of infection were lower respiratory tract (22%), skin/soft tissue (11%), intraabdomen (5.6%), central venous catheter (5.6%), urinary tract (2.8%), surgical site (2.8%) and others (11%). Mean onset time of infection was 25 days (± 41 days) and mean onset time according to infection sites were in order of following; intraabdomen (3.8 ± 3.4 days), lower respiratory tract (15.8 ± 27.7 days), skin/soft tissue (17.3 ± 28.4 days), surgical site (23 ± 22.5 days), central venous catheter (41.7 ± 42.8 days) and urinary tract (50.0 ± 27.7 days). Mortality rate was 7.4%. Death was attributed to infection in four patients. In multivariated analysis, patients with infections are more likely to have prolonged hospital care (odds ratio (OR) = 1.042; p £ 0.001), long-term ventilator care (OR = 1.556, p < 0.001) and open fractures (OR = 7.113, p = 0.018). APACHE II score (OR = 1.037, p = 0.044) and duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.074, p = 0.001) were contributed to death, independently. Conclusions: Multiple trauma patients have high risk of infection. Most common infection was lower respiratory tract infection. APACH II score was not a risk factor for infection but a risk factor for death. The objectives of this study were to identify the incidence and risk factors of NIs and cost of the NICU stay attributed to NIs in a Turkish NICU. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 1, 2004 to May 31, 2005 , in the NICU of the Eskisehir Osmangazi University Hospital, 900-bed academic tertiary care centre with a 17-bed NICU. Exposure variables from maternal and newborn data were prospectively collected by daily visits. Diagnoses of NIs were based on the recommendations of the Centres for the Disease Control. Statistical analysis was performed with the software program SPSS (Version 10.0). Results: Of the 309 patients surveyed, 48 (15.5%) had acquired NIs. The most common site of NIs was found as urinary tract (39.4%), eye-ear-nose-throat (18.8%), skin and soft tissue (18.8%) and blood stream (12.5%). The relationship between NIs and probable risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay (+ 7 days), low birth weight, previous antimicrobial usage, corticosteroid treatment, intubation, mechanical ventilation, CPAP, surgery, total parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition and polycytemia were found statistically significant. The relationship between NIs and sex, gestational age, twin birth, route of delivery, home birth, low apgar scores were not statistically significant. Most common nosocomial pathogens were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and Klebsiella spp. The additional hospital stay because of NIs was 7.4 days. The median cost was found as 1061 Euro for newborns without NIs and 3082 Euro for newborns with NIs. Conclusion: The risk factors for NIs detected in our NICU were similar to those defined worldwide. Gram-negative bacteria were the leading cause of NIs. The increase in the medical cost due to NIs was remarkable.",3.6983742768026593,4.275566532121104

We examined risk factors for mortality among Irish patients with S. aureus BSI. Methods: A set of Irish hospital laboratories provide enhanced (clinical, demographic and risk factor) data on episodes of BSI reported to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS). Outcome data, including in-hospital mortality, has also been reported by a subset of laboratories since the beginning of 2005. We examined in-hospital mortality vs. survival before the end of each EARSS survey period (90 days) with logistic regression and survival analysis. Results: There were 116 episodes of S. aureus BSI reported, with 39 in-hospital deaths, 71 discharged and 6 still in hospital at the end of the survey period. Of all the factors examined, length of stay (LOS) prior to BSI, age and meticillin resistance were all significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Mortality among patients with MRSA BSI (n = 53, 60%) was significantly higher than among patients with MSSA BSI (n = 63, 11%). Cox regression, controlling for LOS and age, demonstrated that methicillin resistance was the only significant contributor to mortality (HR 3.4, 95%CI 1.2-9.2). The baseline survival curve is shown. Conclusion: Methicillin resistance remains a significant risk factor for in-hospital mortality among patients with S. aureus BSI after controlling for age and LOS.",3.5173720750045536,3.1450988870353616

Age and gender matched case-control study to analyse the association between cigarette smoking and the risk of hospitalised CAP in elderly people was performed. Methods: The eligible cohort (n = 15,049) is derived from Korean Elderly Pharmacoepidemiology Cohort (n = 46,113) that is population-based dynamic cohort. The cohort members were over 65 years of age, living in Busan Metropolitan City between 1993 and 1998, and beneficiaries of Korean Medical Insurance Corporation (KMIC). The information on smoking status, alcohol consumption, past-medical history, height, weight, performance status, and other daily life related variables at their age of 65 years were collected by self-administered mailed questionnaire. Potential cases (n = 260) of hospitalised CAP, were collected from the KMIC medical claims database between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 2000 . The incident cases of hospitalised CAP (n = 83) were confirmed through the medical records. Four controls were matched to each case randomly using age, gender, and year of questionnaire survey (n = 332).

Underlying lung disease (aOR, 7.17; 95% CI, 2.78-18.50) and alcohol ex-drinker (aOR, 5.83; 95% CI, 1.36-24.95) by the age of 65 years was associated with higher risk of hospitalised CAP. Smoking, total amount of cigarette smoking, and duration of smoking by the age of 65 years were not significantly related to the risk of hospitalised CAP. The other factors, including performance status, BMI, other underlying diseases, were not associated with the risk of hospitalised CAP. Conclusion: Underlying lung disease and alcohol ex-drinker by the age of 65 years can be the independent risk factors for hospitalised CAP in elderly people in later period. The chronic previous exposure to smoking, however, is not a risk factor of hospitalised CAP in the same people. These suggest chronic respiratory damage due to cigarette smoking might not influence on the occurrence of acute lower respiratory tract infection in the community environment. A similar trend was also observed for high level P resistance (7, 6 and 14.3 % in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively) . Although it can be as high as 44.4% among pen I/R isolates, overall resistance to erythromycin was 15.1% with minimal variation for different periods of time. MLSb tpe resistance was dominant among ER isolates as shown both by phenotypic tests and PZR. No resistance to levofloxacin was detected. All of the Mc isolates were susceptible to amoxy-clav (AMC), fluoroquinolones and cefaclor. A small increment in b-lactamase positivity was seen over the years (78% in 2003 to 93% in 2005) . Hi isolates were also universally sensitive to 2nd and 3rd gen cephalosporins and AMC with b-lactamase production ranging from nil (2003) to 4. 3 % (2005) .

It is deemed a cost-effective investment in preventing losses and is considered one of the four priority areas in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 which has been endorsed by the third United Nations World Conference in Japan.4 Over the past few decades, emergency response efforts have evolved from a focus on top-down relief assistance to a more comprehensive strategy with a greater emphasis on community participation and pre-event preparedness for better risk management. This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities.5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay.6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical.7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death.8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events.9

He suggests that prophylaxis and vaccination should not only reduce the probability of infection (discussed above) but also reduce the probability of onward transmission by a factor of 100. The effect of prophylaxis and vaccination should be accounted for, as we noted in our article (5), but again only if the infection occurs in the source laboratory where workers are prepared; moreover, the factor of 100 reduction is much too optimistic, for the following reasons. (i) It assumes the infection is detected, which may or may not occur before spread. (ii) It assumes that vaccines and antivirals are given and effective against the lab-engineered virus, which is not guaranteed or in some cases even likely for the reasons noted above. (iii) If infection is detected before spread, and if vaccines and antivirals are given to the exposed person rapidly, and if the strain is susceptible to the antiviral, the reduction in infectiousness of a vaccinated, antiviral-treated case is probably closer to a factor of 5 to 8 than a factor of 100. This estimate is based on an assumption of multiplicative effects of antivirals and vaccination, using clinical data to estimate that oseltamivir reduces infectiousness approximately 5× (by 80%) (21) and a meta-analysis of published studies showing no reduction in infectiousness (22) yet suggesting a “best guess” of a 1.7-fold (40%) reduction in infectiousness from a well-matched inactivated vaccine (22).

Ethical Aspects of (Visions of) Preventive Forensic Screening,"This leaves restriction and exclusion types of P strategies, which (if efficacious) reduce or cancel the crime risk, but not to the benefit of I. That is, the risk reduction will be achieved through the selective restriction of I’s liberty and/or by more or less comprehensively limiting I’s access to society (up to the extreme of preventing altogether the very existence if I). This is akin to draconian communicable disease management in situations when no cure for highly contagious and severe conditions exists, and isolation and quarantine become the remaining options to fight an epidemic. Although such steps may be justified by dire circumstances from a public health ethical standpoint, it has been argued that minimization (ideally avoidance) of restrictiveness should be a primary consideration also in communicable disease management and public health work (Gostin et al., 2003; Gostin, 2005). The most extreme version of exclusion approaches (the preconception or prenatal one) would attract a whole body of critique against eugenics.17 Presumably, Lombrosian restriction or exclusion programmes targeting children and young people would be open to similar charges of inhumanity. On the other hand, in cases of already active offenders, detected increased risk of recidivism may to many people be perceived as sound reason for increased restrictive measures, or even long-term incarceration, although critical ethical views could be lent on such “preventive detention” arrangements as well (McSherry, 2014). An in-between position seems to hold for programmes targeting the group of young children displaying aggressive behaviour in combination with a lack of behavioural control, hyperactivity and difficulties interacting with others. They have already exhibited violent behaviour but, although it might be conceptualized as increasing the risk of repeated violent behaviour, it seems way too early labelling it as a type of recidivism motivating preventive restrictions of freedom or exclusion from society.18",14.949910522657511,8.344613272354263

One hypothesis for the decreases we observed in important prevention-related topics may be an unfortunate side effect of the current paradigm of health information dissemination.

These variants range from the ambitious project of prenatal or even preconceptual detection of Is with F throughout the entire population to the most restricted approach of further probing young criminal offenders to assess risk of recidivism. In between, we have strategies where subgroups of the population are approached for further inquiry, e.g. socio-economic groups, people living in areas burdened by increased or more serious criminality or people who have been diagnosed with certain conditions in health care or educational settings.11 The resulting nine variants may then be combined with three different intervention strategies (i.e. generic variations of P) to achieve the desired preventive effect, depending on the nature of T and F and the evidence for how the forensic risk may be reduced. Basically, there are three generic P approaches to achieve this: manipulating F (including F’s influence on the risk) through treatment,12 manipulating I through restrictive measures (leaving F and its basic influence on body and mind untouched) or preventing the access of I to society through exclusion (in its most extreme form, implying that I never comes to exist).

For example, following weather-related disasters there is a differential impact on deaths and well-being by gender, while children and the elderly, who are more likely to be based in and around the home, are more likely to be affected by flooding events with a rapid onset [35]. Indigenous populations are also likely to be greatly impacted due to their occupation of economically and politically marginal areas and fragile ecosystems [36]. Such variability needs to be incorporated into the development of any policies or interventions to improve adaptive capacity. There is evidence to suggest that individual weather-related extreme events can facilitate adaptations such as policy and regulatory change, as immediately afterwards the policy climate may be more conducive to change [37]. Yet pressure for a quick recovery and short-term risk reduction can actually result in greater vulnerability to future events [38, 39].

The emergence of COVID-19, which started as clusters of pneumonia with unknown etiology in China at the end of 2019, was unique and thus, a good example for KCDC to conduct a series of risk assessments to evaluate the potential risk of importation, transmission, and the impact at the country-level.

To establish methodologies and approaches for risk assessment and risk mitigation for this context, it would be valuable to start with a global assessment of the risks and benefits of this realm of research, identifying the common aspects of risk and benefit within PPP experiments and other approaches covered in the funding pause. For example, any risk assessment should include estimates of the probabilities of accidental infection and extensive spread, as well as estimates of the impacts of these events should they occur. The specific values of these estimated parameters will differ for different types of experiments. It will then be necessary to set standards and expectations for the quality and characteristics of risk-benefit assessments for individual experiments, for example, to distinguish coronavirus research from influenza research, enhancements of pathogenicity from enhancements of transmissibility, and other important distinctions. Given that the term “risk assessment” is used to mean different things by different people, an agreement on an approach to individual risk assessments would be needed to ensure rigor and credibility. Once this kind of analytic structure is established, individual risk assessments for GOF experiments that meet the definition in the new USG policy (3) should become the norm before such experiments are funded.

In December 2019, China noticed few pneumonia cases relating to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV). Told case incidence has been increasing dramatically and reached the hundreds, but it is likely to be an under-estimate [2] . The Coronavirus menace has now been spread all over the countries in globe.

This endemic of novel Coronavirus has been caused due to the mobility and interaction of people who moved from one country to another by outbound fights. Therefore, we argue that densely populated countries as well as cities are more likely to be infected with novel Coronavirus because of inbound and outbound flights and other means of transports. It implies that both in-bound and out-bound flights of passengers are significant factors in triggering Coronavirus infection risk in more densely populated countries than in less densely populated countries. However, previous studies did not consider the population density factor while modeling the risk of 2019-nCOV transmission. Recent studies estimates the risk of Coronavirus transmission from the Chinese cities to other destinations [4, 5] . More importantly, Haider et al.

Assuming an R0 of 2.2, the absolute risk reduction was 7%, 12%, and 20%, respectively, for contact tracing levels leading to isolation at 10%, 30%, and 50%. Figure 3B describes the absolute reduction in risk of a major epidemic. The largest reduction was 37% when R 0 =1.5 and 50% of contacts were traced. The smallest reduction was 1% when R 0 =3.7 and 10% of contacts were traced. Using those estimated relative reductions, the median time of delay gained by travel volume reduction is shown in Figure 4 . The time delay of a major epidemic was less than one day when R 0 is 2.2 and 3.7, and 1 to 2 days when R 0 is 1.5. . Delay in the time to a major epidemic gained by travel volume reduction.

This matches the current available data on COVID-19 and has a similar effect as an SEIR model would have. Furthermore, we did not distinguish between recovered and passed away in the models. From a modelling perspective, whether a node recovers or dies has the same implication: it cannot get reinfected nor can it spread the virus. From a human health perspective, the fact that the number of removed nodes is likely to include a number of deaths (depending on the fatality of the virus), paints a potentially sombre picture for the model outcomes in which herd immunity is achieved. For COVID-19, the current case fatality rates of Germany and Italy were calculated to be 0.2% and 7.7%, respectively (Lazzerini and Putoto, 2020) . Evidently, these figures are dependent on the number of cases tested as well as other factors. Anyway, the potential magnitude of fatality rates implied by these numbers does suggest that mitigation strategies that lower the number of infected people required for herd immunity may be necessary to keep high-risk citizens safe from the infection. In this case, a combination of hub specific and equally applied mitigation (i.e. random) strategies should be considered. Hub specific mitigation strategies are more likely to lower the peak of infection, whereas equally applied mitigation strategies are more likely to increase the number of individuals that never contract the disease.",8.266601613559574,5.457460641850419
