Coronavirus (CoVs) (2) is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, which infects humans and a wide variety of animals, causing diseases in the respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological systems with varying severity (3). In the past few decades, newly evolved CoVs have posed a global threat to public health, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that were implicated in the 2003 outbreak in Guangdong, China and the 2012 outbreak in the Middle East, respectively (2). On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (4). As of 22 February 2020, nearly 77,043 COVID-19 infections in humans have been confirmed in China, with at least 2,445 reported deaths. As reported herein, four pregnant women were confirmed to have the COVID-19 infection in our medical center, which is designated as one of the treatment centers for pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection.

Current evidence suggests that the virus originated from wild animals and birds (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/) [2] . To date, more than 2,800 deaths and 87,000 confirmed positive cases have been reported around the world, making COVID-19 a major health concern. As a first line of treatment, along with the antiviral drugs, clinicians are using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the S1 domain of the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein [1] . Very recently (25 January 2020) the first and complete genome sequence of COVID-19 was deposited in the NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3) providing the key to the likely structure and glycosylation pattern of the viral proteins and consequent mode of interaction with the host cell. Similar to most other coronaviruses, the outer membrane spike glycoprotein, known for its glycosylation [3] , is the prime host interacting protein with host cell targets (such as ACE2, CD26, Ezrin, cyclophilins and other cell adhesion factors) important for cell adhesion and virulence [4, 5] . However, the specific host cell factors or proteins that facilitate the novel COVID-19 remain elusive. The current study was thus undertaken to predict the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein structure and glycan shield pattern that has great implications for understanding the viral camouflage and mode of cell entry, potentially assisting the development of new vaccines, antibodies, small-molecule drugs and screening of the human host targets.",70.57994652183682,27.04185666578154

This model was validated using the C-Score (confidence score) and TM score (structural similarity) ( Figure S2 ) demonstrating the most correct fold and confidence of the predicted structure. Further validation and refinement was completed by ensuring that the residues occupied Ramachandran favoured positions using Coot (www.mrcimb.cam.uk/) ( Figure S2 ).

As of 22 February 2020, 77,043 cases of novel COVID-19 infections have been confirmed and 2,445 people have died (http:// 2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/). During this epidemic, four live-born infants were born in our medical center, to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection. Three of the four pregnant women gave birth by cesarean section due to concerns about symptomatic maternal infection. The other infant was born by vaginal delivery to a mother experiencing fever (highest temperature 38.3 • C), with a diagnostically confirmed infection. The most important question is whether the COVID-19 could be transmitted vertically to the fetus from the pregnant mother and cause a clinically significant infection. Recently, a finding from nine other cases suggested that there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy (1) .

The spike glycoprotein trimer was then subjected to a surface glycosylation builder (http://glycam.org/ glycoprotien_builder/) for the predicted sites and visualized in PyMol. We also performed the same analysis for the SARS-CoV spike protein, to identify significant differences in glycosylation patterns (Figure 1(D,E) ). The built glycosylation shield structures of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins were superimposed and are shown in Figure 1(C) . As shown in Figure 1 (C) and Table S1 , there are a number of conserved glycosylation sites between these two viral strains, however there are also several unique glycosylation sites in COVID-19 compared to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein. This suggests a different shielding or glycan camouflage pattern of the spike proteins, which may underlie differences in host immunity.

To make a long story short, two parental viruses of SARS-CoV-2 have now been identified. The first one is bat coronavirus RaTG13 found in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province and it shares 96.2% overall genome sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 [3] . However, RaTG13 might not be the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 because it is not predicted to use the same ACE2 receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence divergence in the receptor-binding domain sharing 89% identity in amino acid sequence with that of SARS-CoV-2. The second one is a group of betacoronaviruses found in the endangered species of small mammals known as pangolins [4] , which are often consumed as a source of meat in southern China. They share about 90% overall nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 but carries a receptor-binding domain predicted to interact with ACE2 and sharing 97.4% identity in amino acid sequence with that of SARS-CoV-2. They are closely related to both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, but apparently they are unlikely the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 in view of the sequence divergence over the whole genome. Many hypotheses involving recombination, convergence and adaptation have been put forward to suggest a probable evolutionary pathway for SARS-CoV-2, but none is supported by direct evidence. The jury is still out as to what animals might serve as reservoir and intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Although Huanan seafood wholesale market was suggested as the original source of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, there is evidence for the involvement of other wild animal markets in Wuhan. In addition, the possibility for a human superspreader in the Huanan market has not been excluded.

This is an excellent example of how a high-quality clinical study can make a major difference in policy setting. Several important clinical features of COVID-19 have also been documented in this study. First, an attack rate of 83% within the family context is alarmingly high, indicating the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Second, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in this family range from mild to moderate, with more systematic symptoms and more severe radiological abnormalities seen in older patients. Generally, COVID-19 appears to be less severe than SARS. Third, an asymptomatic child was found to have ground-glass opacities in his lung and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in his sputum sample. This finding of asymptomatic virus shedding raises the possibility for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic carriers to others, which is later confirmed by others [2] . Finally, the presentation of diarrhea in two young adults from the same family also suggests the possibility for gastrointestinal involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection and fecal-oral transmission.

However, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be caused by a novel coronavirus not seen before. Alongside uncertainty related to infection aetiology and outcomes, emerging concerns relate to the use of common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. The Belgian Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products released a statement on 16th March 2020 stating 'It is well known that NSAIDs and corticosteroids can lead to serious complications'. Equally, a report by French Authorities suggested the use of ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients was detrimental to patient condition and recovery.

For instance, a well-known CFR estimate for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003 was approximately 17% [3] , roughly indicating that one out of five diagnosed cases would die of the disease. SARS containment measures were implemented as early as possible due to high estimates of CFR. The total volume of deaths, i.e., mortality, is determined by the product of the CFR and the total number of cases; it should be remembered that our perceived severity of the COVID-19 epidemic can be directly influenced by the absolute number of deaths.",65.00810990198863,21.142119065051716

SARS-CoV is predominantly transmitted through indirect or direct contact with mucous membranes in the mouth, eyes, or nose [35] . It has been shown that unprotected eyes and exposed mucous membranes are vulnerable to SARS-CoV transmission [36] . A member of the national expert panel on pneumonia was infected by SARS-CoV-2 after the inspection in Wuhan [37] . As he wore a N95 mask but not any eye protector, and experienced eye redness before the onset of pneumonia, it was thus suspected that unprotected exposure of the eyes to SARS-CoV-2 might be another transmission pathway [37] . However, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected from the conjunctival swab sample in a confirmed COVID-19 patent with conjunctivitis [38] , suggesting that more evidences are needed before concluding the conjunctival route as the transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2.

A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV) is causing pneumoniaassociated respiratory syndrome [1] . After analysis of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from different infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 shares high sequence identity with SARS-CoV [2] . Compared to SARS-CoV, transmitted from human-to-human of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be greater. As of February 2020, at least 25 countries reported >70,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show typical pneumonia and severe lung damage [3] . COVID-19 can be diagnosed by either clinical CT radiography or a laboratory real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) [4] . Unfortunately, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines currently. Several approaches can be suggested to control infections of SARS-CoV-2, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotides, peptides, interferon and small-molecule drugs [5] . The antibody-mediated humoral response is crucial for preventing viral infections. A subset of these antibodies, which reduce viral infectivity by binding to the surface epitopes of viral particles and thereby blocking the entry of the virus to an infected cell, are defined as neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) [6] . NAbs elicit their protective activities in three main steps. NAbs may prevent the attachment of the virion to its receptors on targeted cells, causing aggregation of virus particles. Further, the viruses are lysed through the constant (C) region of the antibody-mediated opsonization or complement activation [7] . This review focuses on understanding immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and addressing the benefits, challenges and considerations of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs).",61.82949797725379,20.06707039818659

Millions of people are affected daily by this virus and thousands have already died around the world. The COVID-19 disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel variant of the virus, similar SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is a β-genus coronavirus that belongs to a large family of single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses. 1 After entering the body, coronaviruses fuse their envelopes with the membranes of host cells, then they transport their genetic material into the affected cells. This essential fusion is mediated by glycosylated spike proteins on the surface of the virion interacting with proper surface receptors on the membrane of the host cell. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is a known human cell-surface protein to which CoV spike proteins specifically bind. 2 ACE2 is a vital protein in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The activation of RAS is triggered by the secretion of renin from the kidney, through juxtaglomerular cells. Renin is a protease that cleaves angiotensinogen, the precursor of angiotensin, which is made by the liver; it produces an inactive peptide, angiotensin I (AngI). ACE then mediates the conversion of AngI to AngII, a major RAS effector. ACE is a protein that is highly expressed on membranes of vascular endothelial cells, predominantly in lung tissue. 3 Most RAS-associated physiologic effects are driven by the interaction of AngII with a G-protein coupled AngII type 1 (AT1) receptor. This activates a physiologic pathway in different systems: kidney, liver, central nervous system, respiratory system, and/or cardiovascular system. Some crucial events are regulated via active AT1 receptors including arterial pressure, fluid and sodium balance, fibrosis, and cellular growth and migration. 2 Some studies have reported an increased inflammatory responses due to AT1 activated by AngII. 4 In some pathological conditions, overactivation of AT1 may lead to damaging events such as fibrosis in different organs (eg, liver and lungs), perhaps through increasing TGF-β expression. 4 Other studies have indicated that ACE2 has a protective effect on the fibrogenesis and inflammation of different organs, as well as the liver and the lungs. 4, 5 Taking these studies together, the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis in the RAS system shows a predominant role in organ fibrosis, particularly in the lungs and liver. 4, 5 According to some recent studies, ACE2 has a regulatory effect on innate immunity and gut microbiota composition. 6 Moreover, ACE2 has a determinant antifibrotic role in the lung injury induced by sepsis, acid aspiration, SARS, and lethal avian influenza A H5N1 virus. 6 On the other hand, the most common complication leading to the COVID-19-induced mortality is respiratory failure due to extensive, accelerating lung fibrogenesis. Rather than PCR-based testing to detect CoV infection, a radiologic lung infiltration pattern on chest X ray could have diagnostic value in screening patients suspected of COVID-19. 7, 8 The cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 due to its massive replication in infected cells, need more time than the acute manifestation of COVID-19. Thus, the acute acceleration of lung fibrosis in COVID-19 can be explained by ACE-AngII-AT1 overactivation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 8 Losartan is an AT 1 antagonist with a selective, competitive function that decreases the end-organ responses to AngII. This common antihypertensive agent is currently prescribed to highblood-pressure patients, particularly those who are prone to diabetic nephropathies. 9 Losartan counteracts the physiological effects of AngII, including release of aldosterone. Plasma renin activity then increases because of the absence of AngII feedback. Losartan induces several biochemical events: converting angiotensinogen to AngI and AngI to AngII (by ACE), and vasoconstriction and aldosterone release (by AngII). Aldosterone leads to the retention of sodium in the kidney, which increases the blood pressure. Losartan can neutralize the downstream effect of renin and AngII, ultimately resulting in lower blood pressure. 10 According to some limited studies, losartan has an inhibitory effect on the development of liver fibrosis and even contributes to the regression of the fibrosis stage in chronic HCV patients. 11 In another study, losartan led to the downregulation of TGF-β1 and fibrogenic molecules in human trabecular meshwork cells infected by cytomegalovirus. Thus, losartan has the potential to decrease trabecular meshwork fibrosis in patients with cytomegalovirusinduced hypertensive anterior uveitis. 12 Recently, losartan has been suggested for the treatment of Marfan syndrome. Losartan reduces the TGF-β level and, consequently, fibrosis. 13 Some experimental research has also confirmed the preventive effect of losartan against lung fibrosis in paraquat poisoning. 14 Accordingly, losartan is a selective antagonist of AT1 receptor that exerts an inhibitory effect on the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis in the RAS system, a known molecular pathway for end-organ fibrosis. Thus, losartan may be suggested as a potential agent of protection from lung damage induced by COVID-19. Losartan may also have a protective function against lung fibrosis through other molecular mechanisms such as the downregulation of TGF-β1. This hypothesis need to be verified through in vitro and in vivo investigations.",62.664757183017684,21.90651002318941

The causative agent soon proved to be a new betacoronavirus related to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease has been named ""COVID-19"" by the World Health Organization (WHO) and on January 30, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO Director-General [2] . Despite the lockdown of Wuhan and the suspension of all public transport, flights and trains on January 23, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases, including 6,484 (16.1%) with severe illness, and 909 deaths (2.2%) had been reported in China by the National Health Commission up to February 10, 2020; meanwhile, 319 cases and one death were reported outside of China, in 24 countries [3] .",63.15439408436277,22.104037929526967

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",60.85437312895549,22.064677732299486

Further, these analyses emphasize the importance of the incubation period, and the fraction of subclinical cases, as determinants of individual screening outcomes. We define subclinical cases as those too mild to show symptoms detectable in screening (fever or cough) after passing through the incubation period (i.e. once any symptoms have manifested).

Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens. Gostic et al. eLife 2020;9:e55570.

In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",75.12155829825738,26.26540202583431

The WHO named this novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19 (1, 2) , and there have been confirmed cases in 117 countries or territories outside China, including Japan, the United States of America, Italy, Iran, and Brazil (1) . Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals (3, 4) .

For example, in July 2003, the WHO reported 8 437 SARS-CoV cases, especially in China and Hong Kong, with 813 related deaths (5) . Concerning MERS-CoV, from June 2012 to April 2018, 2 206 people were infected in 27 countries, 1 831 cases in Saudi Arabia, with 787 deaths (6) .

Four of these result in little more than a common cold and are endemic around the world. The viruses known as human coronavirus (hCoV)-229E, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43 are of little concern at a global public health level. The other two, however, have caused more widespread concern. In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in the human population. In a matter of months, this virus from a bat that transmitted via a palm civet to infect a human in the Guangdong province of China infected over 8,000 people, killing roughly 10% (1) . In 2003, SARS-CoV infections stopped, and the virus has not been seen since. A second epidemic coronavirus, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in 2012. Like the SARS-CoV outbreak, MERS-CoV started with a patient suffering pneumonia and came from a zoonotic event (this time from a bat via a camel to a human) (1) . However, MERS-CoV has shown far more limited human-to-human transmission than SARS-CoV. Since 2012, there have been roughly 2,500 cases of MERS-CoV, mostly confined to regions of the Middle East. While case numbers are low for MERS-CoV, there is a high case fatality ratio (CFR) of approximately 35%, making this virus one of the deadliest human pathogens. Coronaviruses that infect humans all appear to have respiratory transmission, making them pathogens of pandemic potential. The end of 2019 saw the emergence of a novel human coronavirus that is rapidly spreading around the global and has a higher degree of lethality than the endemic coronaviruses, though not to the level of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. The virus was initially named 2019-nCoV but is now termed SARS-CoV-2 and causes the disease COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). At the time of writing, there have been over 115,000 cases and over 4,000 deaths.",61.516652231515444,21.364359780311933

In response to this unprecedented outbreak, which has already produced a higher number of infected cases and mortality within the first 6 weeks of its declaration than the entire outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, 2,3 a rapid infection control response is essential to contain and mitigate the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreak. In the SARS-CoV outbreak, almost 60% of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV occurred among HCWs 4 ; therefore, it is critically important to implement proactive infection control measures among HCWs, and these measures must be planned in advance. In Hong Kong, a cosmopolitan city of 1,104 km 2 with a population of 7.45 million in southern China, we are at a high risk of importation of infected cases from mainland China. Therefore, we progressively stepped up our infection control measures by widening the clinical and epidemiological criteria of surveillance for early recognition and isolation of index cases according to the evolution of the epidemic. In particular, having visited a hospital in mainland China was introduced as an epidemiological criterion for surveillance on day 17 of our infection control preparedness measures, even though COVID-19 was confined to Wuhan, Hubei Province, until day 20. 2 The criteria of previous hospital visit was included because it had previously been determined to be a risk factor for SARS acquisition in China. 14 Under the surveillance program, of 42 cases of COVID-19 were identified in Hong Kong, 36 were immediately isolated in AIIR upon admission. During the SARS outbreak, the median time between index patient admission and patient isolation was 4.5 days (1-13 days), according to a review of literature. 4 At the same time, we enhanced the infection control measures by implementing standard, contact, droplet, and airborne precautions for suspected or confirmed cases. We stepped up the use of PPE among HCWs performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), even when caring for patients without clinical features and epidemiological exposure risk in the general wards. Performance of AGPs such as endotracheal intubation, open suctioning, and use of high-flow oxygen was a risk factor for nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV among HCWs. 15 In addition, provision of surgical masks to all HCWs, patients, and visitors in clinical areas was implemented on day 5. Although wearing a surgical mask alone was not clearly associated with protection from acquisition of SARS-CoV, wearing a surgical mask by either HCWs or patients reduces the risk of nosocomial transmission of pandemic influenza. 16, 17 The combination of hand hygiene with face masks shows statistically significant efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza in the community, as illustrated in a systematic review and meta-analysis. 18 Hand hygiene among HCWs and patients was promoted and enforced during the COVID-19 epidemic. 19, 20 With this bundle of infection prevention measures, we were able to maintain zero nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after the importation of first confirmed case on day 22 in Hong Kong.",64.47975239602289,21.363454262978298

It has been shown that 2019-nCov enters the cell through the ACE2 cell receptor in the same way as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [2] . 2019-nCoV effectively uses angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) as a receptor for cell invasion [3] . Primary non-specific reported symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection at the prodromal phase are malaise, fever, and dry cough. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms are fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%) [4] .",58.958525466392736,18.052602438742525

Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) expressed its concerns about the Coronavirus crisis (2) . This crisis caused production and publication of large amounts of valid and invalid information, eventually leading to information obesity phenomenon. Information obesity can have many negative consequences on the general population, causing major problems for governments, especially if the amount of invalid information is too large. It is worth to mention that however almost impossible, controlling and monitoring media is a massive challenge for different governments. Hence, individuals should protect themselves against unreliable information, and pursue an authentic ""information diet"".

The new virus is thought to have originated from an animal-to-human spillover event linked to seafood and live-animal markets. The infection has spread locally in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated on Jan 23, 2020. More than 500 patients infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China have been reported between Jan 1 and Feb 14, 2020. Although laboratory testing for COVID-19 quickly ramped up in China and elsewhere, information on individual patients remains scarce and official datasets have not been made publicly available.

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19.

Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test. They can help in detection of COVID-19 patients.",71.70192731784798,25.46286472110406

A specific reference was made to data from South Korea where 30% of the 2,000 tested patients reported symptoms or anosmia or ageusia. The article states that doctors are advising patients to self-isolate if they experience these symptoms as it could be an early indication of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. This is particularly pertinent since current governmental guidelines in the United Kingdom (UK) state that if you have either a temperature or a dry cough then to self-isolate. Should anosmia emerge as a symptom of COVID-19, this could encourage more people to self-isolate, even in absence of other symptoms, to prevent further spread of the virus. Therefore, more information surrounding this possible symptom is crucial. However, whilst it is possible that anosmia and ageusia are in fact symptoms of COVID-19, to our knowledge there is currently no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia and/or ageusia/dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, testing is not yet widespread in the UK and is mainly occurring only in patients hospitalised with the disease. It seems reasonable at this stage of the pandemic that new anosmia or ageusia in people who are otherwise well should be a trigger for testing where available.

Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19.

Cancer patients undergoing treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) currently used in everyday practice to treat solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, renal carcinoma, urothelial cancers and head and neck carcinoma constitute a growing oncological population [8] . Their specific susceptibility to bacterial or viral infections has not been investigated. Considering that immunotherapy with ICI is able to restore the cellular immunocompetence, as we previously suggested in the context of influenza infection, the patient undergoing immune checkpoint blockade could be more immunocompetent than cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy [9, 10] .",57.553028941652784,20.49927555153823

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) .

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",78.31297143613564,25.85872811884029

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",61.84253466541318,18.773754729282476

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",52.099007384294936,17.635126389275126

There is a limited number of evidence on oral-fecal transmissibility of the pathogen. However, COVID-19 RNA was found in fecal specimens of 2 to 10% of confirmed patients with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea (11, 12) , so fecal-oral transmission should be taken into account as a probable route through case investigation.

First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar. In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs. Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63). On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms. On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower. Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV. On one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs. On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Finally, same as the other HCoVs [41] , SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples. Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies. It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs. Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.",67.57372979729814,24.152364980114548

Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined. Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified. Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.

Also, the diagnostic methods used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections are not identical to those of SARS-CoV. This is reflected by the specific recommendations for public health practitioners, healthcare workers and laboratory diagnostic staff for SARS-CoV-2 (for example, the WHO guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 37 ). By uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases that some of them cause in humans and animals, we wish to support the WHO in its efforts to establish disease names in the most appropriate way (for further information, see the WHO's guidelines for disease naming 38 ). The further advancement of naming conventions is also important because the ongoing discovery of new human and animal viruses by next-generation sequencing technologies can be expected to produce an increasing number of viruses that do not (easily) fit the virus-disease model that was widely used in the pregenomic era (Box 1). Having now established different names for the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease (COVID-19) , the CSG hopes that this will raise awareness in both the general public and public health authorities regarding the difference between these two entities.

First, because it normally binds to ACE2 during its degradation and hydrolysis into angiotensin-(1-7) [11] , it may compete with the SARS-CoV-2 for the ACE2 receptor (Fig. 1) . Second, the binding of AngII to the AT1 receptor has been shown to cause internalization and downregulation of ACE2 through an ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase pathway in both in vitro animal and in vivo human models [12, 13] . Third, AngII has been shown to cause AT1 receptor-dependent destruction of ACE2 through ubiquitination and transport into lysosomes. The competitive inhibition, downregulation, internalization, and then degradation of ACE2 may decrease the degree of viral infection by interfering with host cell entry of the virus. Much has been made of the hypothetical risk of COVID-19 in the setting ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which have been shown by multiple investigators to increase expression or activity of ACE2 [14, 15] . In fact, severe COVID-19 disease has been described in patients with conditions known to be associated with RAAS blockade therapy, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus [5] . However, to date, the link between ACE inhibitors and ARBs and severity of illness of SARS-CoV-2 infection is purely speculative. Both the American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology have published statements advising against the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in SARS-CoV-2. Fig. 1 Effect of angiotensin II on the RAAS and SARS-CoV-2 binding. Angiotensin I is hydrolyzed by ACE1 to form angiotensin II, which binds to AT 1 receptors. This causes release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland, vasopressin secretion from the hypothalamus, and vasoconstriction. Vasopressin and aldosterone both lead to increased sodium and free water reabsorption in the kidney, leading to increased mean arterial pressure (MAP). Angiotensin II is then metabolized into Ang-(1-7) by ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into the host cell. Exogenous angiotensin II can also bind to ACE2, which can lead to competitive inhibition of the ACE2 receptor. In addition, binding of angiotensin II to AT 1 receptors leads to internalization, downregulation, and degradation of ACE2. These actions may potentially prevent SARS-CoV2 from entering the cell.

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in.

For all coronaviruses including COVID-19, at least three structural proteins are shared on the membrane: spike (S), the membrane protein (M) and small membrane protein (E). Also, another four functional proteins were found in almost all coronaviruses: 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase. During the viral infection process, including intracellular transport of virions, proliferation and assembling of virions in the infected cellnot only structural and functional proteins but also some proteasesplay a key part, suggesting that targeting these proteins or enzymes as a therapy against COVID-19 infection could be a promising strategy.

Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Remdesivir is being developed by Gilead as a monophosphoramidate prodrug: GS-441524. It was intended to be an intravenous treatment for Ebola but it also shows potential against coronavirus and Nipah virus infection. The results from evaluating the antiviral efficiency of remdesivir against a clinical isolate of COVID-19 in vitro suggest that it could inhibit COVID-19 strongly with an EC50 ranging from 0.77 to 1.76 μM [3] . Remdesivir cured the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the USA, which prompted Gilead and the Chinese authorities to move the Phase III trial ahead and expand it to a lot more patients who desperately need treatment. Final results of the clinical trial will be announced in April 2020. In contrast to remdesivir, the activity report of favipiravir in vitro and in vivo is limited. However, there are still three active clinical trials regarding favipiravir that have begun enrolling patients in China. Lopinavir and ritonavir, targeting 3Clpro, were used to treat SARS patients from China in 2003. Shortly after the emergence of MERS-CoV, researchers identified lopinavir and ritonavir as MERS-CoV inhibitors. The national expert group has recommended lopinavir and ritonavir as effective anti-COVID-19 agents in China, and most clinical trials on COVID-19 select both drugs as positive controls. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Currently, only one trial combines emtricitabine/tenofoviralafenamide and lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19 patients. Arbidol as a 2′-5′oligoadenylates synthesis (OAS) inhibitor against severe pneumonia and virusassociated cytokine dysregulation has displayed anti-COVID-19 potential in clinical trials [4] . However, the mechanism needs to be clarified in the near future. Chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have elicited antiviral effects on several viruses such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E by interfering with endosomal acidification. Based on the advantage of known broadspectrum activity and rarely occurring adverse reactions, a series of clinical trials on chloroquine and its derivatives have been advancing rapidly. Presently, Chinese government authorities have approved chloroquine phosphate to be used to treat adult patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Further, treatments combining Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and chemical molecules (popularly known as Western medicine in China) have shown some exciting results. In view of inconclusive clinical evidence on TCM efficacy, pharmacologists should separate active pharmaceutical ingredients and identify explicit targets as soon as possible [5] . Surprisingly, various drugs are also in clinical trials despite the lack of biological rationale, such as the antiinfluenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir targeting neuraminidase, baloxavirmarboxil targeting cap-dependent endonuclease that is not found in COVID-19, ASC09 targeting protease with no anti-coronavirus research reported, and cobicistat targeting CYP3A4 with only unpersuasive predicted activity by computer virtual docking. As the crystal structures of COVID-19 spike [6] , dimeric full-length human ACE2 [7] and COVID-19 spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ACE2 receptor [8] are published in succession, the lead drug discovery strategy such as structure-based HTS and molecular dynamics simulation to discover inhibitors with affinity to ACE2, the S protein or the protein-protein interaction will be possible in the near future. There have been three major outbreaks of coronaviruses in the 21st century: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19. Drawing experience from effective screening strategies on antitumor drug development, the credible and large-scale screening system of the especially deadly coronaviruses must be set up at the molecular level and in animal models as soon as possible. Although the clinical safety of old drugs has been proven, some of them can cause serious adverse reactions. For example, hydroxychloroquine has the side effect of arrhythmia, which can itself lead to death. Thus, special attention needs to be paid to the safety of old drugs in new indications.",66.8893058776456,23.810503907785737

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",72.68002027780435,23.696912090765608

The newly emerging 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was identified initially in Wuhan, China. Since its first description in December 2019, the total number of cases as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) had reached 191,127confirmed cases on February 18, 2020, with 7807 deaths [2] . The clinical picture and radiographic presentations were recently described [3, 4] and the clinical picture in nine pregnant women [5] were similar to non-pregnant women [3, 4] . One study showed that 15 pregnant patients with COVID-19 had mild disease [6] . All of the pregnant patients in one study and 66.7% of pregnant COVID-19 patients had C-section, moreover all the newborn survived [5, 6] . However, 4 of 9 (44%) pregnant COVID-19 patients had premature delivery [5] . In a previous study of MERS-CoV, there were 11 pregnant women [7] . A comparison between MERS-CoV and COVID-19 cases in pregnancy is shown in Table 1 . There was no difference in the age group of the patients, however, the gestational age was lower among MERS-CoV than COVID-19 patients. Of the MERS-CoV cases in pregnancy, 63.6% required intensive care unit admission and this is comparable to 50% of SARS pregnant women [8] . There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] . Thus, similar to the difference in the clinical presentation and course among SARS, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, there is also differences in the outcome and course of pregnant women with these coronaviruses' infection. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and outcome would guide healthcare authorities and public health on further risk mitigation and advise for pregnant women around the world.

We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2-4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered.

Current research suggests that efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected individuals (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) to uninfected contacts can result from respiratory droplets, aerosols, and direct contact. Other routes, including the fecaloral and mother-to-child vertical transmission, have not been confirmed. The main clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection (known as COVID-19) are fever, fatigue, and cough leading to pneumonia that can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome [2, 3] . There are currently several documented cases of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 that had digestive findings as the first sign of disease [4] .

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members. In addition, we remind the public not to panic, but to prevent it scientifically.",68.20313564688223,23.871097476408778

General measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection will be of utmost importance for these patients. Depending on the local infrastructure, implementation of COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals is warranted. However, based on the local COVID-19-burden, a sharp separation of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" wards/hospitals may not be sustainable, although recent evidence provides somewhat reassuring data regarding the absence of environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA of inanimate surfaces outside patient rooms. 20 Wherever possible, patients with chronic liver disease requiring inpatient care for non-COVID-19 causes should be admitted to COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals. As these institutions may not be able to provide specialised hepatology-care, similar to our recommendations on outpatient care, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information to facilitate immediate hepatology consultations. However, due to the contagiousness of the virus, patients with underlying liver disease will become infected and will subsequently require inpatient care for COVID-19. With regards to nosocomial-infections, recent observations from Spain that compared patient characteristics between patients with community-acquired influenza and nosocomial-acquired influenza could not detect a significant difference between these cohorts with regards to underlying chronic liver disease. 21 Whether these observations will also hold up in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be proven.

Given the common use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs in patients with Covid-19 is urgently needed. Here, we highlight that the data in humans are too limited to support or refute these hypotheses and concerns. Specifically, we discuss the uncertain effects of RAAS blockers on ACE2 levels and activity in humans, and we propose an alternative hypothesis that ACE2 may be beneficial rather than harmful in patients with lung injury. We also explicitly raise the concern that withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors may be harmful in certain high-risk patients with known or suspected Covid-19.",63.97099090053793,20.83358293624674

In order for the virus to complete entry into the cell following this initial process, the spike protein has to be primed by an enzyme called a protease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) uses a protease called TMPRSS2 to complete this process. 10, 11 In order to attach virus receptor (spike protein) to its cellular ligand (ACE2), activation by TMPRSS2 as a protease is needed (Fig. 4) . 10 After the virus enters the host cell and uncoats, the genome is transcribed and then translated. Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicate, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene. 12 The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins.

Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase.

At this time, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) has recommended continuing to treat with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, unless specifically advised otherwise by the individual's medical team. It is very important to keep on top of updates from the FDA or WHO, as their recommendations are susceptible to modification as new evidence becomes available. 12 Data in support of the efficacy and safety of these drugs is, in most cases, circumstantial and weak. Using drugs with unproven benefits may represent experimental use. Intentional research using such agents should be approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent needs to be applied. Clinical pharmacists can play a significant role in getting individuals enrolled in such ongoing studies.",68.51080163680882,25.158598952762084

Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms, which is very similar to the presentation of other respiratory virus infections. Radiologically, COVID-19 is characterised by multifocal ground-glass opacities, even for patients with mild disease. 3 Knowledge of virus dynamics and host response are essential for formulating strategies for antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control of COVID-19. However, a systematic study on these aspects has not been done. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Kelvin To and colleagues 4 report the viral load and antibody profiles of a cohort of 23 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In these patients, the viral load peaked during the first week of illness then gradually declined over the second week. Viral load was also shown to correlate with age. Furthermore, both IgG and IgM antibodies started to increase on around day 10 after symptom onset, and most patients had seroconversion within the first 3 weeks. Finally, the IgG and IgM antibody level against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor binding domain correlated with neutralising activity.",74.19302740705055,25.075123426360037

This suggests some potential difference from SARS and MERS in the pathogenesis of coronavirus [2] . There is also a potential repressed immune function in COVID-19 patients with the hypo-albuminemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and decreased percentage of CD8 + T cell [2, 7] . Recent reports suggest that in some COVID-19 patients, although being negative for the viral nucleic acid test, still sometimes present with a high level of inflammation. A clinical trial using certolizumab pegol (a TNF blocker) along with other anti-virus therapies may have beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients. Collectively, the finding indicates that inflammation is a major feature in COVID-19 patients.

First, our ability to screen for and select COVID-19-negative patients for surgery is limited. Viral shedding and infection transmission occurs during incubation and the median incubation time of SARS-CoV-2 is five days. [9, 10] Indeed, itAmong COVID-19 positive patients who eventually develop symptoms, 99% will exhibit symptoms by day 14 takes 14 days for 99% of infected patients to develop symptoms. [9] AdditionallyMoreover, between 7-13% of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic [4] but may shed virus for weeks. Convalesced COVID-19 patients have exhibited prolonged viral shedding after complete symptom resolution. [11] [3] Unsatisfactory Further compounding the issue, SARS-CoV-2 testing also fails to adequately mitigateis insufficiently available and potentially insufficiently sensitive this problem. SARS-CoV-2 tests are insufficiently available and insufficiently sensitive. False negative test rates in symptomatic patients have ranged from 3-68% [12] [13] [14] but are more likely to be 16-24% according to the most highly-powered study to date (n=1014). [15] Investigators anticipate false negative test rates are likely to be highest near the beginning and end of the disease spectrum: in asymptomatic, infected patients and convalescing patients. [16, 17] Ultimately, COVID-19 positive patients may even elude a two-week quarantine with negative SARS-CoV-2 testing. Second, the virus replicates in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx and oropharynx, which are routine sites of head and neck surgery. [18, 19] Even a Moreover, asymptomatic patients have exhibited high viral loads at these sites. [18, 19] Third, SARS-CoV-2 is aerosolized, and can remain airborne for at least three hours.

[22] Routine use of cautery and suction in upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) surgery, such as transoral robotic surgery, is a continuous AGP. Cautery creates a plume of smoke often requiring constant airway suctioning to both facilitate visualization of the operative field and eliminate the odor of coagulated tissue.

Given the high attack rate [77] [78] [79] and prolonged aerosolization of this virus, [20] augmented infection control and containment training for OR, ICU and floor teams is necessary. [73, 80] Teams should seek to minimize AGPs and limit the length of these procedures whenever possible. For example, anesthesia may consider avoiding bag-mask ventilation, employing rapid sequence intubation techniques, and applying intratracheal or intravenous lidocaine to avoid postoperative coughing.

Legend AGE: aerosol-generating event; AGP: aerosol-generating procedure; TLM: transoral laser microsurgery; TORS: transoral robotic surgery *: Frequent, serial re-evaluation of patient-and surgical-risk will be required, particularly with anticipated improvements in management of patient-level risk. At the time of manuscript submission: there is known COVID-19 community spread with unknown disease prevalence; 1% of patients develop symptoms 14 days after exposure; among patients who develop symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 incubates for a median of five-days during which time viral shedding occurs; ~15% of COVID-19-positive individuals are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic throughout the course of their disease; ~20% of patients with COVID-19 will have exhibit false negative SARS-CoV-2 tests. Therefore, there is justification for a conservative assessment of patient-risk for COVID-19. Despite this judicious approach, a ""low-risk"" patient could still be COVID-19 positive, particularly if the patient is not reliable, does not report breaches in quarantine or positive symptoms, or is asymptomatic with a false-negative test. Improved COVID-19 test sensitivity and faster specimen processing, analysis and result generation may be reasonably feasible and could substantially improve management of patient-level risk. **: Surgery-and post-surgery-specific risks may diverge according to this algorithm.

As demonstrated in this report, the development of mild COVID-19 illness was insidiously initiated and persisted for a long period. The prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 detection in naso-oropharyngeal specimens of the COVID-19 patients with mild illness is of concern in epidemic areas. Clinical manifestations of viral respiratory infections range from asymptomatic or flu-like symptoms such as fever, nonproductive or productive cough, myalgia, rhinorrhea, and sore throat, to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organs failure. 10 Various viral pathogens cause community-acquired infections during the cold season in Taiwan. Of which, influenza A/B, human Metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common. 11 The lack of specificity for clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and chest 13, 14 is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic or presented flu-like symptoms. 15, 16 Under this circumstances, quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients and the application of rapid detection tools for etiology confirmation is strongly recommended.

A large series based on 1014 patients reported a 97% sensitivity of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19, while the mean time interval between initial negative and positive RT-PCR was approximately 5 days [5] .

The ripple effect of the COVID-19 outbreak could potentially bring major challenges to worldwide health systems and have far-reaching consequences on the global economy if the spread of the virus is not effectively controlled. 1, 2, 4 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are relatively large viruses containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome encapsulated within a membrane envelope. The viral membrane is studded with glycoprotein spikes that give coronaviruses their crownlike appearance (Figure 3 ). While coronaviruses infect both humans and animals, certain types of animals such as bats that host the largest variety of coronaviruses appear to be immune to coronavirus-induced illness. 5 There are four classes of coronaviruses designated as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The betacoronavirus class includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus (MERS-CoV), and the COVID-19 causative agent SARS-CoV-2. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lower respiratory system to cause viral pneumonia, but it may also affect the gastrointestinal system, heart, kidney, liver, and central nervous system leading to multiple organ failure. 6, 7 Current information indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible/contagious than SARS-CoV. 8 Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, this disease has spread rapidly around the globe. Considering the potential threat of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been racing to understand this new virus and the pathophysiology of this disease to uncover possible treatment regimens and discover effective therapeutic agents and vaccines.

It highlights antiviral strategies involving small molecules and biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication.

Anti-rheumatic drugs as possible therapies: antimalarials, anti-IL6, anti-IL1 and baricitinib Some drugs usually used in rheumatologic field and targeting the host and its immune response seem to have the potential to interfere with CoViD-19 infection and their potential benefit is being studied in patients (Fig. 1) . The pathogenesis of CoViD-19 remains unclear, but modelling assays revealed a high degree of homology in the receptor binding domains between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. All coronaviruses express a surface glycoprotein termed a ""spike"" which bind to the host receptor for viral entry that has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2r) [1] , expressed by mature lung epithelial cells, enterocytes, kidney proximal tubular cells and endothelial cells [6] . After receptor binding, lysosomal proteases cleave the spike protein releasing the signal peptide that facilitates viral entry into the cell [7] . These mechanisms may be targeted and interrupted by therapies such as chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and preliminary data demonstrate that it may have clinical benefit in the management of CoViD-19 infected patients as determined by improved imaging and shortening of the diseases course [8] . We should note that hydroxychloroquine, which shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine but has a better safety profile and is frequently used particularly in connective tissue disease, has a more potent anti-viral effect than chloroquine in vitro. From the results of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models, a loading dose of 800 mg orally followed by 400 mg daily for four days reaches three times the potency of chloroquine and is therefore a promising drug for both the prevention and the treatment of CoViD-19, with low risk of toxicity [9] . These findings have led to several clinical trials that are ongoing to study the efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in CoViD-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine is thus being used in Italy for the treatment of CoViD-19 patients despite the absence of efficacy data in the clinical setting. In light of these data, the recommendation for rheumatic patients chronically taking antimalarial drugs is to not discontinue them, considering the antiviral efficacy and the immunomodulatory rather than immunosuppressive effect.",66.08314966089128,23.124846082918936

It was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China and the disease was officially named CoViD-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11th , 2020 following an outbreak of acute respiratory illness in the Hubei province. Since these earliest reports, this infection has spread in many countries worldwide with a significant rate of infection in Italy that currently accounts for more than 110,000 infected cases associated with 13,155 fatalities. The WHO declared CoViD-19 a pandemic on March 11th. The CoViD-19 pandemic has important implications for patients with rheumatic diseases, particularly those undergoing a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. As it seems obvious that immunosuppressive therapy increases their risk of severe disease if infected with CoViD-19, many patients have the tendency to stop their immunosuppressive treatments, especially in highly impacted areas such as the Italian Lombardy region. However, it is important to note that many commonly used immunosuppressive drugs such as JAK kinase inhibitors and tocilizumab have been proposed and/or used for the treatment of select patients who develop a frequently fatal clinical sequalae known as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) (also referred to as ""cytokine storm"") following CoViD-19 infection.

SARS-CoV2 is a positive single strand 30,000 nucleotide RNA virus that includes 14 open reading frames that encode 27 proteins and belongs to the Coronaviridae family. Its phylogenetic data are consistent with the presence of a bat reservoir and subsequent spill over into the human population. Sequencing data shows that SARS-CoV2 shares a high degree of sequence homology with a betacoronavirus isolated from bats termed Bat-CoV-RaTG13, suggesting that the Chinese chrysanthemum bat is the likely origin of SARS-CoV2. Nonetheless, an unknown animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan has been hypothesized to act as the intermediate host, as the first cases had common contacts in a market where no bats were present (bats hibernate in December). In addition, SARS-CoV2 shares 79% and 50% gene homologies with the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that was responsible for an outbreak in 2002 and with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV responsible for infections in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively. Both these viruses had intermediate hosts that included the civet and camel, respectively, with humans serving as terminal hosts [1] ."""" Person-to-person transmission has already been established for SARS-CoV2 infection and reasoned to be mediated by respiratory droplets.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases.

The tear film is another area of interest. The tear film has antiviral properties [94, 95] and it is plausible that the tear film could inactivate viruses that were to come in contact with the tears. For instance, the tear film contains the protein lactoferrin, which is thought to prohibit adenoviral entry into corneal epithelial cells [96] . However, this is unknown for SARS-CoV-2, but given the low frequency thus far of patients infected with COVID-19 that demonstrate the virus in the tears [19] this is an area also worthy of study.

Guan et al. also reported that 76.4% cases with viral pneumonia findings at CT were verified COVID-19. 11 Based on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia, patients with typical CT imaging features in Hubei Province will be grouped as clinicallydiagnosed cases, contributing to the total number of confirmed diagnosis according to the ""Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 Pneumonia (Fifth Trial Version)"" released by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China since February 12, 2020. 14 Pregnant women are more susceptible to infectious diseases due to the immune suppression. 15 Previous studies found that there was a male-dominated tendency and few cases occurred in children for COVID-19 pneumonia. 3 , 9 To the best of our knowledge, there are few published data involving the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women and children. 16 , 17 In this present study, the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were investigated for the pregnant women and children in comparison with non-pregnant adults from two centers.

Early identification of COVID-19 is important for the patients as well as the healthy population. Currently, the patients should be isolated for treatment from the healthy people for controlling the epidemic. It has been reported that chest CT is superior to RT-PCR in sensitivity for early detection of COVID-19. 22 Based on the epidemiological characteristics, clinically-diagnosed cases with typical CT features were treated with the same therapy in Hubei Province to offset the effects of possible false negative of the new coronavirus nucleic acid tests. 13 In our study, 44% and 36% pregnant women presented initial onset of fever in either laboratory-confirmed or clinicallydiagnosed group, which was less common than 87.9% in the nonpregnant population in the study by Guan et al. 11 and consistent with the previous study enrolling 9 pregnant women with COVID-19. 17 Currently, fever served as the basic screening flag in China. Absence of typical symptoms increased the difficulty of the surveillance in the pregnant population. Furthermore, the physiological findings about leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio due to adaptations to gestation could further complicate the situation. Nevertheless, no pregnant women were admitted to ICU. Compared with the previous studies, 11 it may be one of the reasons there were more cases of pregnant women categorized as mild or common type in clinical context. As with unenhanced chest CT imaging of pregnant women during the epidemic in Wuhan, low dose technique was implemented with the DLP ranging from 50 to 150 mGy cm for diagnostic imaging in our study, which was safe for the fetuses. 23 Sixteen pregnant women were performed with post-partum CT in our study. As with the CT features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, the common characteristics in the pregnant group included pure GGO, GGO with consolidation or reticulation, and complete consolidation with predominantly peripheral distribution and bilateral lung involvement, which were similar to those of the non-pregnant group in our research as reported in the previous studies. 19 , 20 , 24 There were overlaps in imaging findings between COVID-19 and other viral infections, such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pneumonia, as well as H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 infections. 19 , 20 The patterns of GGOs or GGO with the above features in predominantly peripheral distribution will facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. 20 The above imaging findings could be mostly explained by a recently published research on the pathological investigation of COVID-19. 25 Diffuse alveolar injury superimposed with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline membrane formation was identified on pathology. Other findings included pulmonary edema and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (dominated by lymphocytes). Therefore, we have the GGOs, consolidations, and reticulations which indicate fibromyxoid exudates, the interstitial edema and the lymphocytes infiltrate resulting in the lymphopenia inside the blood. The more common consolidation and relatively higher TSS in the laboratoryconfirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant women suggested the more severity in pregnant women, except for three laboratoryconfirmed pregnant women showing no abnormalities related with COVID-19 pneumonia at CT. Therefore, there is no doubt that the CT study did a big favor in structuring the clinical treatment strategy for the pregnant women as we hoped. Fortunately, the infants were all normal without any evidence of vertical transmission from women with COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, which was consistent with the prior research by Chen et al. 16 While compared between the two pregnant groups, the consolidation were more frequent in the clinically-diagnosed group with a relatively higher TSS of 4 ·8 (SD 3 ·5), indicating relatively more severe lung involvement resulting from delayed treatment prior to a laboratory confirmation. Cases with initial negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 but high clinical suspicion were also reported in previous studies, and the SARS-CoV-2 was positive after repeated tests. 12 , 13 For the clinically-diagnosed patients, it is speculated that samples from the lower respiratory tract via lavage and repeat tests may be helpful to rule out the false negative results. Fortunately, the laboratory-negative cases with typical imaging findings were supposed to receive the same treatment protocol as the positive ones in China. Pleural effusion was identified in 6/16 (38%) and 6/25 (24%) patients in the laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant groups, which was more than that in the study by Song et al. 20 This phenomenon could be attributed to a common finding within 1-24 h of normal delivery. 26 Compared with adults, fewer children are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Nine children younger than 14 years out of 1011 patients were reported by Guan et al. 11 Our study revealed that the non-specific abnormalities (pure GGO or consolidation) distributed without peripheral predominance at CT unlike the adults. However, when superimposed with other pathogen infections, the pulmonary involvement was more severe, as simultaneous infection of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in one child was detected in our study. Nevertheless, it was difficult to distinguish if the consolidation was associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, since the consolidation and pleural effusion were also common in pure RSV infection. 27 The contact history and clinical symptoms of fever or cough may be helpful for the surveillance.",62.01757810652663,23.416986798734897

Initial reports identified two species of snakes that could be a possible reservoir of the COVID-19. However, to date, there has been no consistent evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds [10, 18] . Genomic sequence analysis of COVID-19 showed 88% identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [19, 20] , indicating that mammals are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans. Several reports have suggested that person-to-person transmission is a likely route for spreading COVID-19 infection. This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan [13, 21] . Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth. This is important because pregnant mothers are relatively more susceptible to infection by respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia (https://www.thelancet.com, DOI:https://doi.org/10. 1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3).",83.29169864284432,29.605828327582305

Studies show clear person-to-person transmission. The average incubation period is 2-14 days, and mostly 3-7 days. However, in some patients, this period may be longer. Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID -19 where a 47year-old woman with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14-day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan. Almost at the same time, her father and sister were diagnosed with COVID-19. The results suggest that the long-term use of glucocorticoids might cause atypical infections, a long incubation period, and extra transmission of COVID-19.",67.76411180594269,23.123839224026064

Methods: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]).

Common symptoms reported in adults with COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue; severe cases have been associated with dyspnoea and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT. 3 In China, the SARS-CoV-2 reproductive number is estimated at 2. 6 The combined case-fatality rate is 2% in China, 7 and the risk of death is increased significantly in older people (approximately 15%). 7 It is noteworthy that infants and children have not been featured prominently in COVID-19 case statistics. An analysis from China has shown that children younger than 10 years account for only 1% of COVID-19 cases, 7 similar to the proportion for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics. 4, 5 Infants and young children are typically at high risk for admission to hospital after respiratory tract infection with viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. 8 Immaturity of the respiratory tract and immune system is thought to contribute to severe viral respiratory disease in this age group. 8 Therefore, the absence of paediatric patients with COVID-19 has perplexed clinicians, epidemiologists, and scientists. The patients in this study 9 were being treated at three hospitals located in Zhejiang province, China, which is 900 km from Wuhan. The children accounted for roughly 5% of total patients with COVID-19. Patients were stratified by disease severity and were assessed in hospital (mean duration of hospitalisation, 14 [SD 3] days) for secondary bacterial and fungal infection, sepsis, immune responses, and organ dysfunction (lung, liver, heart, and kidney).

The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to numerous countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study reveals that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We find a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship is confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence reveals that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirm the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear.

This hypothesis has led some European countries to produce initial policies relying on decreased transmission rates during the summer months, 3 and the belief that African countries will face smaller epidemics than their European counterparts. However, no strong evidence base exists for such claims; SARS-CoV-2 might have simply arrived later to warmer countries. We used data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Baltimore, MD, USA) to plot the cumulative number of cases since the diagnosis of both the first patient and the first five patients by country, both in Europe and Africa (figure). Although the first confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred later in west Africa than in Europe, once these first cases were confirmed in west Africa, the expansion in the number of confirmed COVID-19 was rapid. Of particular concern are Burkina Faso and Senegal, which saw sharp increases in the number of cases soon after the initial cases were confirmed in these countries. Cases in both countries might evolve in a similar way to what was observed in European countries with the most expansive epidemics (ie, Italy and Spain, where SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly after case number five was detected). Senegal also confirmed its first three cases of community transmission on March 21, 4 suggesting more cases in this country than the 119 confirmed on March 27.",72.75527547900944,25.384696233141163

They reported that 5.0% of COVID-19 infected patients had nausea or vomiting and 3.8% had diarrhea. 21 30 A recent meta-analysis of 4243 patients from China suggested that approximately 17.6% of patients had any gastrointestinal symptom, including 9.2% with pain, 12.5% with diarrhea, 10.2% with nausea/vomiting. 31 One of the concerns with many of the published studies is the possible duplicate inclusion of the patients across reports, thereby limiting valid performance of pooled estimates in a meta-analysis. 32 There is evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens independent of the presence of diarrhea. Some studies showed that stool continued to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA even after respiratory samples became negative. Chen et al reported a case of COVID-19 based on compatible symptoms and lung imaging in a patient with positive stool real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but negative pharyngeal swabs and sputum samples. Furthermore, Wang et al reported confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 positive fecal samples in 2 patients without diarrhea. 12, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 What are the liver manifestations of COVID-19? Liver injury is estimated to occur in up to 20-30% of patients at the time of diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 14 Severe hepatitis has been reported but liver failure appears to be rare. 39 The pattern of liver injury appears to be predominantly hepatocellular, and the etiology remains uncertain but may represent a secondary effect of the systemic inflammatory response observed with COVID-19 disease, although direct viral infection and drug-induced liver injury cannot be excluded. One study of liver biopsy specimens obtained from a patient with COVID-19 disease revealed microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, suggestive of either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 41 Abnormal liver enzymes may be observed in both adults and children with COVID-19, 42 and do not appear to be a major predictor of clinical outcomes. 15 Early studies have multiple methodologic limitations, with variable laboratory thresholds, limited longitudinal assessment of liver enzymes, heterogeneous evaluation for alternative etiologies, and limited information regarding baseline liver diseases and confounding variables. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the unique clinical considerations for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis, 43 although preliminary guidance has been provided by the AASLD on March 23, 2020. 44 What are the potential risks to health care workers performing endoscopy? SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets from talking, coughing, sneezing, and close contact with symptomatic individuals. However humanto-human transmission can occur from unknown infected persons (e.g. asymptomatic carriers or individuals with mild symptoms) as well as individuals with virus shedding during the pre-incubation period before symptoms develop. 45 Data related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic have confirmed that health care professionals are at higher risk of infection than the general population. The WHO and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reported infection of 2055 health care workers as of February 20, 2020 during the index outbreak in Hubei Province, with health care workers facing a rate of infection approximately three times the general population. 46 This prompted the Chinese Department of Health Reform to deploy more than 40,000 additional health-care workers to the region, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and implement surveillance measures and quarantine protocols. 46 Such measures appear to have slowed the spread to health care workers, with recent cases primarily attributable to household contacts rather than occupational exposure. Similar trends have been observed in Europe, with an estimated 20% of COVID-19 infections in Italy occurring in health care workers. 47 Preliminary reports in the US also suggest that health care workers are at risk of nosocomial infections, including infection of 20 health care workers among the first 67 COVID-19 positive individuals in Philadelphia, and additional health care workers cases in WA, NY, and MA. 48, 49, 50 The spread of disease via health care workers is concerning for several reasons: a) appropriate PPE may not be utilized effectively, especially when COVID-19 patients cannot be identified quickly, b) shortage of health care workers due to infection and/or quarantine, and c) the concern of the role of infected health care workers to act as a vector for transmission to patients.",57.70680092807976,20.58756751753617

[68] [69] [70] Therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for COVID-19 include molecules binding to the virus, molecules, or inhibitors that target specific enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription, small-molecule inhibitors targeting helicase, essential proteases, or other proteins of the virus, host cell protease inhibitors, host cell endocytosis inhibitors, siRNA, anti-sense RNA and ribozyme, neutralizing antibodies, mAbs targeting host receptor or interfere with S1 RBD, antiviral peptide targeting S2, and natural products. 2, 11 There is a long list of anti-CoV agents, mostly preclinical compounds yet to be evaluated as anti-COVID-19 agents. Some of these agents are in phase III trials for COVID-19, including remdesivir, oseltamivir, ASC09F (HIV protease inhibitor), lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and cobicistat. 71 Many existing MERS-and/or SARS-CoVs inhibitors can be screened for efficacy. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has shown 96% identity to that of SARS-CoV, a critical finding since drugs developed for SARS-CoV RdRp might show similar efficacy for SARS-CoV -2 RdRp. 28 S protein is considered the major target for designing CoV antiviral therapies such as S protein inhibitors, S cleavage inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, RBD-ACE2 blockers, siRNAs, fusion core blockers, and protease inhibitors. 19 All such therapeutic strategies have shown potential in vitro and/ or in vivo anti-CoV activities. Comparatively, even though in vitro studies performed with these agents have shown efficacy, most of them lack sufficient support due to the lack of randomized animal or human trials, hence of limited use for COVID-19. Hence, the necessary support of extensive animal and human trials is required for such therapeutics to become useful. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 affects the balance of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), potentially leading to exacerbation of severe pneumonia. Thus, it is speculated that ACEI and angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) inhibitors might be able to reduce pulmonary inflammatory responses, thereby reducing the mortality. 72 The guidance to COVID-19 control might be based on existing measures for MERS and SARS, with some further precautions due to the unknown nature of this new CoV. 14, 73 The main treatments such as mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe cases. Furthermore, RNA synthesis inhibitors (like 3TC, TDF), remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, Chinese traditional medicine, such as Lianhuaqingwen and ShuFengJieDu Capsules, could be the promising COVID-19 treatments. 2 However, further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for COVID-19. A major limiting factor in the quest for identifying an ideal vaccine or therapeutic agent is time. It may take months to even several years for researchers to develop, produce, standardize, evaluate, approve, and commercialize therapeutic agents for COVID-19. Hence, current efforts should be directed toward identifying and evaluating drugs and immunotherapeutics that have proven efficacy against viruses similar to COVID-19.",64.5623949563476,22.175988615660906

[20] Furthermore, the average duration from the time of first symptom to death of the 7 non-survivors (8¢7 days, range 4 to 13 days) is apparently shorter than that reported previously. In the report of Huang and colleagues, [5] the median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7.0 days (4.0À8.0) and to ICU admission was 10.5 days (8.0À17.0) and 6 patients (15% of the total of 41 cases studied) did not survive ICU. The study did not report the exact dates of patient death, but it is safe for us to say that the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was longer than 10.5 days and thus longer than that of the non-survivors in our study.

Unlike other human coronavirus infections, COVID-19 does not commonly present with upper respiratory symptoms like rhinorrhea [5] . One study showed that a sizeable proportion (18%) of patients who are infected with COVID-19 may not exhibit any symptoms at all [24] . Most symptomatic patients with COVID-19 will present with fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. They will have findings of pneumonia on chest X-ray and computed tomography scans of the chest [31] . Most symptomatic patients suffer a mild respiratory infection requiring supportive care like supplemental oxygen. Patients can also develop gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea [32] .

Several institutions have recommended interim precautions to screen new donors. The US Food and Drug Administration has suggested considering a donor's history of travel to areas of outbreak, cohabitation with infected individuals, or diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 within the 28 days before recovery of donor tissue. 2 Similar measures have been taken by the Global Alliance of Eye Bank Associations and by the Joint United Kingdom Blood Transfusion Services Professional Advisory Committee to rule out potential donors. 3, 4 The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation has recommended excluding potential donors who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and waiting at least 21 days before donation in those with a history of high-risk travel or contact. 5 In Italy, where the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading rapidly, the national transplant centre has taken stronger measures and has recommended testing all potential tissue and stem-cell living donors, as well as dead donors, through real-time RT-PCR assays of nasopharyngeal swab samples (or bronchoalveolar lavage in deceased individuals). 6 Faecal microbiota transplantation is a novel treatment that has rapidly earned a major role in the management of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection because of its clear advantages over antibiotics. 7 It is becoming increasingly more widespread and standardised around the world. Last year, an international expert panel, including several authors of this Comment, released recommendations on how to screen faecal microbiota transplant donors, including a medical history and blood and stool examinations. 8 Given the global COVID-19 outbreak, we, as an international group of experts in faecal microbiota transplantation and stool banking, believe that recommendations to update (at least temporarily) the screening of stool donors are urgently needed, as the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 by faecal microbiota transplantation might be higher than that in other tissue transplants. Evidence has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 can be found in faeces, and that stool samples can remain positive for the virus even when it is no longer detectable in the respiratory tract, suggesting the possibility of a faecal-oral route of transmission. 9 This concept is supported by the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients affected by COVID-19. 10 Another relevant issue is that faecal microbiota transplantation is not classified in the same way worldwide, as some countries regulate these transplants as a drug (eg, the USA, the UK, and France), some as a tissue (eg, Italy), and others do not provide specific regulation (eg, Australia). 8 This discrepancy results in a confusing scenario, in which some countries will apply rules for human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products, and others will not, potentially contributing to the spread of the infection. A more alarming issue is represented by the uncontrolled practice of homemade faecal microbiota transplantation, which is widespread among patients who want to try this treatment for indications outside of clinical guidelines or clinical trials. 11 To prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we propose additions to the current donor screening measures. In all countries, before each donation, physicians should screen for two main items: the presence of typical COVID-19 symptoms (including fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnoea, and headache) within the previous 30 days; and the donor's history of travel to regions known to be affected by COVID-19 or close contact with individuals with proven or suspected infection, within the previous 30 days. If either of these items is positive, the potential donor should either be rejected or tested with RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. In endemic countries, the RT-PCR assay should be considered in all donors, even if they are asymptomatic or do not have a history of high-risk travel or contact. Alternatively, donor stools should be stored and quarantined for 30 days before use, and released only if the donor has not developed symptoms. Finally, stool banks should retrospectively check the health status of the donor before using frozen faeces, according to local epidemiology, to avoid further potential spreading of SARS-CoV-2. These suggestions should be tailored to local health-care organisations, and should be updated accordingly as further insight into COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 is gained.",60.15005644501228,21.612834201883203

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",67.09576336292369,24.99368298462808

The context is worthy of study, since Singapore was among the first settings to report imported cases, and has so far succeeded in preventing community spread. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in Singapore, numerous non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented successfully, including effective triage and infection control measures in healthcare settings, isolation and quarantine of patients with SARS and their contacts, and mass screening of schoolaged children for febrile illness. 4 Each of these measures represented an escalation of typical public health action. However, the scale and disruptive impact of these interventions were small compared with the measures that have been implemented in China in response to COVID-19, including closure of schools, workplaces, roads, and transit systems; cancellation of public gatherings; mandatory quarantine of uninfected people without known exposure to SARS-CoV-2; and largescale electronic surveillance. 5, 6 Although these actions have been praised by WHO, 5 the possibility of imposing similar measures in other countries raises important questions.

In 2019, Chen et al. found that SARS-CoV Viroporin 3a triggered the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages, suggesting SARS-CoV induced cell pyroptosis [89] . Studies have shown that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have increased IL-1β in the serum [26] . As the rise of IL-1β is a downstream indicator of cell pyroptosis, this may suggest that cell pyroptotic activity is likely to be activated and involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, as both classical and nonclassical pyroptosis signaling can induce the release of IL-1β, it is unclear which pathway is involved in COVID-19. Based on existing data, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to cause cell pyroptosis, especially in lymphocytes, through the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.

On January 7, 2020, Chinese health authorities confirmed that this cluster was associated with a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV [1]. The virus was subsequently renamed SARS-Cov-2 as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B), with which it shares more than 79% of its sequence [2] . Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded RNA viruses which belong to order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae [3] , and have been classified into four major groups: α-CoVs, β-CoVs, γ-CoVs and δ-CoVs [4] .

First, the novel coronavirus may exert direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissue. This is supported by the detection of PCR fragments of coronavirus in blood and urine in 2003 SARS 18 and COVID-19 patients. 4 Recently, it has been shown that the novel coronavirus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor, which is identical to that of the SARS-CoV as reported in 2003. 19 Recent human tissue RNA-seq data demonstrated thatACE2 expression in urinary organs (kidney) was nearly 100-fold higher than in respiratory organs (lung). 20 Therefore, the kidney disease may be caused by coronavirus entering kidney cells through an ACE2 dependent pathway. Second, deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T lymphocyte or antibody) may damage the kidney. However, kidney microscopy specimens from SARS patients were reported to show a normal glomerular aspect and absence of electron-dense deposits. 5 This is not in support of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Clearly, potential pathological kidney changes in COVID-19 patients require further study. Third, virus-induced cytokines or mediators might exert indirect effects on renal tissue, such as hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis. In fact, some of the 2009 H1N1 patients had mild to moderate elevations of serum creatine kinase. 21 In keeping with this observation, 138 patients with COVID-19 disease, who were admitted in ICU, showed a tendency towards increased creatine kinase levels, 13 and the patients with kidney involvement in our study tended to have increased creatine kinase levels as well.",56.46469956589637,21.190036621526023

The difference in the use of glucocorticoid may be explained by the condition of patients with AKI that was more severe , thus physicians tended to use glucocorticoid in the most critically ill patients, even if there is a controversy on the use of glucocorticoid in COVID-19 patients. 22, 23 However, the oral antiviral drugs, including arbidol (umifenovir), oseltamivir, lopinavir and ritonavir, were preferred in moderate patients on admission. Given that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the safety and potential effects of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered. 24 Even though this study included a large number of patients from a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, it has several limitations. First, an accurate baseline serum creatinine was not available, which may have led to an underestimation of AKI or erroneous associations.

The approach we followed is based on establishing several lines of evidence that clearly pinpoint SARS-CoV as a relevant model to extrapolate likely targets of responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus associated with COVID-19. The first line of evidence pertains to the fact that of coronaviruses known to infect humans, SARS-CoV is the most similar in phylogenetic terms to SARS-CoV-2.

Pregnant women are more susceptible to respiratory pathogens; hence, they may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. Moreover, due to the characteristic immune responses during pregnancy and potential risks from the cytokine-storm by COVID-19 infection, pregnant women with COVID-19 may face severe morbidity and even mortality. Although existing evidence does not support the intrauterine vertical transmission, the maternal infection and inflammation occurred in response to COVID-19 could affect the developing fetus and even postnatal life. With the continuing pandemic of COVID-19, more efforts should be made to protect both mothers and fetuses. Further studies are warranted to investigate the pregnant women with COVID-19 in the first and second trimester and follow-up the pregnancy outcomes and postnatal development of the fetus.",73.46987916745843,25.6443199087067

Genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed that there were two major types (designated L and S), which were well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms. The S type was found to be ancestral version, however, the L type (∼70 %) is more aggressive and spreads more quickly than the S type (∼30 %) (Tang et al., 2020) . The amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 share 68 % similarity with those of SARS-CoV, to which the response of viral infection by type I IFN is suppressed and therefore viruses rapidly replicate and induce excessive inflammatory response (Prompetchara et al., 2020) . Moreover, there was significant discrepancy of serious cases and deaths happened between the areas within Hubei Province and the rest of the world, which may be possibly explained by antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes with other coronaviruses. ADE can cause sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and cytokine storm, and one or all of which happened in the reported severe cases and deaths (Tetro, 2020) . Although SARS-CoV-2 has some similarities with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than other viruses among populations, which has caused more than 60,000 people infected worldwide within 2 months (Lu et al., 2020) . More importantly, there is no effective targeted treatment for the virus, and a persistent infection may involve stages of both silent and productive infection of the host cells (Boldogh et al., 1996) .

Most coronaviruses cause diseases in their particular host species; 1 those that can infect humans through cross-species transmission have become an important threat to public health. Two serious coronavirus disease outbreaks have happened in the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, 2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. 3 Since December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognised as the causal factor in a series of severe cases of pneumonia originating in Wuhan in Hubei province, China. 4 This disease has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause disease via a mechanism analogous to the SARS coronavirus, with potential damage to vital organs such as lung, heart, liver, and kidney, and infection poses a considerable risk to patients by the high prevalence of pneumonia. 5 By March 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had led to 80 981 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, and 44 067 cases in 117 countries. 6 A cohort study of 44 672 Chinese cases reported that 2·1% of patients were younger than 20 years, and 1·2% were asymptomatic. 7 Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children. 8 Distinct immunological responses to viral infections can exist in children and result in severe damage to vital organs. 9 Although short-to-medium-term outcomes for children who recovered from SARS seemed good, the disease caused exercise impairment after more than 6 months. 10 A comprehensive literature search indicated that MERS was rare in children (31 cases identified between 2012 and 2016), 11 because transmission depends heavily on animal exposure and direct contact in the household or health-care facilities. Collectively, these two coronavirus diseases did not widely affect children because of the short-term epidemic of SARS and the strict transmission route of MERS. In a study of 15 children with COVID-19 (aged 4-14 years), six patients had small nodular ground-glass opacities in the lungs. 12 At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, all schools were on the spring festival holiday, which might have prevented children from exposure to transmission sources.

Reliable data for profiles of serial viral load and serum antibody responses are needed urgently to guide antiviral treatment, infection control, epidemiological measures, and vaccination. The peak viral load of patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections occurs at around 7-10 days after symptom onset, which could be associa ted with nosocomial outbreaks involving healthcare workers. 2, 4 Clinical studies of antiviral agents for SARS showed that the viral load decreased significantly with treatment success. 5 No systematic study of these two important variables with statistical analysis has been done for SARS-CoV-2, although preliminary descriptive studies have been reported.

Approximately 2-10% of patients with COVID-19 present with diarrhoea, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool and blood samples. 11 This evidence implicates the possibility of viral exposure in the liver. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the target cell, 7 where the virus replicates and subsequently infects other cells in the upper respiratory tract and lung tissue; patients then begin to have clinical symptoms and manifestations. Pathological studies in patients with SARS confirmed the presence of the virus in liver tissue, although the viral titre was relatively low because viral inclusions were not observed. 3 In patients with MERS, viral particles were not detectable in liver tissue. 4 Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), a diagnostic biomarker for cholangiocyte injury, has not been reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies; we found that it was elevated in 30 (54%) of 56 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalisation in our centre (unpublished). We also found that elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were observed in one (1·8%) of 56 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalisation. A preliminary study (albeit not peer-reviewed) suggested that ACE2 receptor expression is enriched in cholangiocytes, 12 indicating that SARS-CoV-2 might directly bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function. Nevertheless, pathological analysis of liver tissue from a patient who died from COVID-19 showed that viral inclusions were not observed in the liver. 13 It is also possible that the liver impairment is due to drug hepatotoxicity, which might explain the large variation observed across the different cohorts. In addition, immune-mediated inflammation, such as cytokine storm and pneumonia-associated hypoxia, might also contribute to liver injury or even develop into liver failure in patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.",69.04689257990945,25.100621621589564

For example, rubella infection in the first trimester can affect more than 50% of fetuses via intrauterine infection, whereas by the end of the second trimester the incidence rate is reduced by half. 17 We did not collect samples of vaginal mucosa or shedding in birth canals, which prevented us from analysing whether COVID-19 could be transmitted during vaginal delivery.

This coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (formerly 2019-nCoV), is responsible for respiratory infections including pneumonia, with an estimated mortality rate of approximately 2-2.5%, increasing with age and the presence of underlying diseases. In the first days of March 2020, an estimated 89 068 cases had been confirmed worldwide by the World Health Organization (WHO) (a number likely underestimated due to the existence of asymptomatic carriers) and the epidemic has already left 3046 dead from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the majority of them occurring in China. Because COVID-19 is now becoming pandemic, and in the absence of a known validated efficient therapy, effort s of laboratories and medical teams have focused on repurposing US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to treat the most severe COVID-19 cases. Drug repurposing is an effective way to quickly identify therapeutic drugs with a known safety profile to treat an emerging disease. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, a front-line drug used in the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria as well as in autoimmune diseases, has been shown to inhibit the replication of several DNA and RNA viruses, including most human coronaviruses [3] . Recently, chloroquine was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its hydroxylated form has been proposed as a possible therapy to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [4 , 5] . In this context, other drugs also showed significant efficacy against SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, including remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir ( https://drugvirus.info/ ) [6] .",62.8150536798112,20.6705531432167

Coronaviruses are viruses with single-strand positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kilobases [3] . They have been commonly found in a wide array of host spectrum including avian, camels, bats, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, and cats [2] . Since its early identification, in the very begin of 2020, several nucleotidesbased surveys and sequence homology-based alignments have been carried out with the focus to elucidate the viral origin and delineate cell-and host-tropism of the viral agent on the attempt to guide better management and control of the virus diffusion [4] . Sequence similarity alignments have reported SARS-CoV-2 being highly similar to several wildlife animals such as bats, pangolins and masked palm civets [3] . Controversial results have been reported concerning the snake coronavirus [2, 5] . Nevertheless, the sole investigation of the genetic sequences might result in a biased and/or incomplete depiction of the virus source, biology and its pathogenetic mechanism [4] .

Results: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, as well as other public health events, can cause emotional distress and anxiety. These feelings of distress and anxiety can occur even in people not at high risk of getting sick, in the face of a virus with which the common people may be unfamiliar. I read publications on ""Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control"" and on ""Traumatization in medical staff helping with COVID-19 control"" with a great interest (Li et al., 2020; Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020) . Li et al. reported how much people and medical staff suffer from vicarious traumatization and how this vicarious traumatization of non-front-line medical staff is more serious than that of front-line medical staff (Li et al., 2020) . As in South and Southeast Asia countries, also in Italy, there are similar problems in medical staff due to high workload and intermittent lack of protective devices. In addition, some slight form of racism is demonstrated against health care professionals who potentially have a higher risk of being infected and between non-front-line medical staff towards front-line medical staff. We don't have to forget the many doctors and nurses were infected and many of them died due to COVID-19 infection. Also in Italy, local people also have high levels of stress due to no firm estimate of how long pandemic will last and how long our lives will be disrupted or whether or not we or our loved ones will be infected. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide spectrum of psychological impact that outbreaks can inflict on people (Lima et al., 2020) . New psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness can occur or aggravate the condition of those with pre-existing mental illness and cause distress to the caregivers of affected individuals (Kelvin and Rubino, 2020) . Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals very often do not receive any training for providing mental health care (Lima et al., 2020) . Barbisch et al. (2015) described how the confinement ""caused a sense of collective hysteria, leading the staff to desperate measures"". Suicidal cases were reported in India (Goyal et al., 2020) but also in other countries, Italy included, where two infected Italian nurses committed suicide in a period of a few days probably due to fear of spreading COVID-19 to patients. It is possible that fear and anxiety of falling sick or dying, helplessness will drive an increase in the 2020 suicide rates.

It is unclear whether the recombination events took place in a human host or a mosquito vector co-infected by multiple virus strains. However, when two different virus strains simultaneously infect a single cell, it is theoretically possible for recombination to occur through a copy-choice mechanism [1] wherein recombination results from template switches during viral genome replication. The existence of six breakpoints (two breakpoints per recombination region) in GD23/95 implies six template switches. Recombination might occur during synthesis of the positive strand of the viral genome as observed in the case of polioviruses [8] and pestiviruses [16] . During the recombination processes observed in this study, no insertions, deletions, or duplications occurred. However, the precise mechanism underlying the recombination events observed in the present study is unknown. A better understanding of the recombination process requires the development of experimental models for co-infection and the generation of recombinant DENV.",11.278521936686076,5.885321631573571

A high proportion of prisoners in many countries use drugs. Among injecting drug users (IUD) infections like HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) are prevalent. Methods: Drug users were recruited at different assembly points, such as streetwalkers district, methadon providing points and homeless shelters. Injecting and non-injecting drug users were eligible if they used at least one day a week. Participants were given a face-to-face questionnaire about sociodemographics, prison history, drug using behaviour and sexual practice. Serum samples were tested for the following infection markers: antiHIV, HbsAg, antiHBc, antiHCV and TPPA. HIV antibodies were confirmed by Westernblot. The characteristics of the source population were representive for the regional drug using population: 78% were male, mean age was 36 years (sd. 7; range 19 to 57), 79% was of Dutch origin, 71% had ever used drugs intravenously, 85% used heroin, 59% used cocaine, 65% used methadone, 55% used benzodiazepines, 35% recently injected heroin (in the last 6 months) en 20% recently injected cocain. Results: We compared two groups: A) 153 participants who were never imprisoned or only once and B.) 165 drug users who were imprisoned at least two times (but often many times more). In group B 10% ever injected drugs while in prison (17/165) and 67% (54/165) recently had sex. Group B differed significantly with higher prevalence of HIV (AntiHIV; 14% vs 4%), hepatitis B (HbsAg; 7% vs 1%; AntiHBc; 64% vs 43%) and hepatitis C (AntiHCV; 72% vs 57%) are found. Syphilis (TPPA) does not significantly differ between the two groups, although prevalences are suggestive in the same direction (3% vs 1%). In our study population 68% (215/318) recently had sex in the last 6 months (usually unprotected) and 37% had sex for money (often without condoms). Discussion: The high observed in-prison prevalence of viral infections have consequences for in prison transmission potential. Transmission of these infections could be prevented by hepatitis B vaccination among prison populations and prison staff, needle exchange and condom use. Because of the shortage of cells in Dutch prisons, the national policy is changed to put not one prisoner in a cell but two. This policy might create an additional risk for transmission.",10.851928525568008,5.507551468104458

Methods: Prospective study of surveillance, epidemiological, and treatment completion data for cases of tuberculosis in our Tuberculosis Unit between 1991 and 2004. Variables examined included sex, age, race, country of birth, main location of disease, drugs susceptibility, HIV infection status, initial medications, medical provider type, treatment completion and course of disease. Differences between M. bovis and M. tuberculosis patient characteristics and treatment completion rates were compared using the v 2 test or the Fishers exact test. Medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Differences were considered statistically significant at a level of p < 0.05. Results: 787 cases of culture-positive tuberculosis were identified, of these 782 were M. tuberculosis and 5 (0,6%) were identified as M. bovis, (incidence 0.17 per 100,000 person-years). All the patients infected with M. bovis were HIV-negative adults, they were born in Spain, none had travelled outside of Spain and no links that might allow airborne person-to-person transmission of M. bovis were discovered among any of the patients. They were older (51. 2 ± 14.3 vs 38.1 ± 19.1 years) and had more extra-pulmonary disease (80% vs 32.1%, p < 0.05) compared with M. tuberculosis patients. M. bovis isolates were resistant to pyrazinamide but there were not differences in resistence to isoniazid (0/5 vs 12/451) and rifampin (0/5 vs 1/450 ) compared with M. tuberculosis. The median treatment duration was approximately 3 months greater for M. bovis than for M. tuberculosis patients. Differences in frequency of Direct Observed Treatment (1/5 vs 37/781), treatment completion rates (Default 0/5 vs 42/776), toxic hepatitis (0/4 vs 49/770) and evolution (Death by TB 1/5 vs 21/782; Relapse 0/4 vs 9/771) was no significant. Mean follow-up was 26.7 ± 25.9 months (range, 1-174; person-months, 21055) . Conclusion: The predominant clinical presentation was consistent with progression from latent TB infection. No person-toperson airborne transmission was identified. M. bovis infection is frequently of extra-pulmonary localization. Duration of treatment tended to be longer for patients infected with M. bovis and completion rates and evolution were comparable to those of patients infected with M. tuberculosis.",13.011331324631698,5.18858510489802

Methods: Women admitted to a University Hospital as inpatients during the 5-year study period were included in the study. Data were abstracted from clinical charts. Individuals were divided into two groups, those with normal (Pap I-II) and abnormal (Pap III-IV) cervical cytological screening results. Statistical methods were used to compare socio-demographic and clinical variables. Analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: A cohort of 75 women who had tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was included in the study. The mean age was 33.9 (range 19-56). Fifty-one individuals (68.0%) originated from Europe, 16 (21.3%) from Africa and eight (10.7%) from Asia. The overall prevalence of abnormal cytological smears was 29.5%. During the study period, 41 (54.7%) presented with normal and 34 (45.3%) with abnormal smears. Of these 34 women, 27 (79.4%) had cytological evidence of human papilloma virus infection (HPV). Herpes simplex virus infection was detected in seven (9.3%) women, Trichomonas vaginalis and Chlamydia in five (6.7%) and seven (9.3%), respectively. When comparing both groups, no significant association was found between socio-demographic determinants and the presence of dysplasia. However, a significant determinant for HPV infection was immunosuppression (CD 4 cell count 291 vs 488/ll; viral load 134.679 vs 16.102 RNA copies/ll). Numbers of cytological changes due to HPV infections occurred more frequently in this group (cytological evidence of infection 79.4 vs 24.4%; Condylomata acuminata 29.4 vs 7.3%). Conclusions: Cervical dysplasia due HPV infections appears to be highly correlated with the immunosupression in HIV positive women. 87.85% and other localisation 33.2%) and the rest with HSV-2. 50.46% of the patients are treated with different antiretroviral combinations. During monitorisation 67.5% of the treated patients and 61.3% of the untreated presented herpes recurrences (mean 4.2 ± 2.9 vs 3.9 ± 2.7). The recurrences were more frequent in severe immunosuprest patients (CD4<200), 76.4% vs 57.4%, p = 0.005. Recurrent ratio wasn't modified in patients with a good immune response to therapy. The recurrences were less frequent in patients with undetectable viral load, 58.6% vs detectable, 80%, (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Antiretroviral therapy and immune restoration do not influence the rate of herpetic reactivation.",13.438146793083238,4.703351377579133

Among them, C. dahurica (Turcz.) Maxim., C. heracleifolia Kom., and C. foetida L. have been listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and C. simplex has been listed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia as the original plants of Cimicifuga rhizome in Japan [2] . Cimicifuga rhizome has long been used in East Asian countries to treat headache, dentalgia, aphtha, swelling and pain in the throat, measles, and prolapse of uterus, along with other crude drugs [3] [4] . The constituents of Cimicifuga plants have been extensively investigated and the principal metabolites are 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides, phenolic derivatives, sterols, alkaloids, and chromones [5] [6] [7] [8] . Interestingly, among these compound types, the 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides are considered to be characteristics of the Cimicifuga genus, which possess estrogen-like effects and immunosuppressive activities [9] . Recently, more than 120 cycloartane triterpene glycosides have been isolated from C. simplex [5] . The aim is to review these cycloartane triterpene glycosides from the chemical Cimiacerogenin type cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins from Cimicifuga simplex The 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides are lanolin alkanol type tetracyclic triterpenoids with a distinctive structure of a 9,19-cyclopropane in the B ring. The side chain possesses a hemiacetal structure and a high level of oxidized functional groups, which react with the D ring into seven groups. There may be a close relationship among the biosynthesis of these seven types, as they all have a high level of oxidation at C-15, C-16, and C-17. Oxygen substituents, such as hydroxy and acetoxy groups, may be located at C-1α, C-3β, C-6α, C-7β, C-11β, C-12β, C-15α, C-16β, C-18, and C-25; with double bonds at C-7/C-8 and C-25/C-26; and carbonyls located at C-15, C-16, and C-23. The two hydroxyl oxygens of C-24 and C-25 may also be dehydrated to form a ring in these seven types. Glycosidic groups at C-3β of the lanolin alkoxides are mostly xylose, and only a few are glucose and arabinose.",12.186008616281928,4.265103015698674

Rats were randomly divided into four groups: saline control group (Nc), N-protein group one (P1, 6 h), N-protein group two (P2, 24 h), N-protein+dexamethasone group (D, 10 mg/kg). Their blood, bronchial alveolar lavage fluid(BALF) and lung tissue were collected after challenging. Cytological and histopathologic changes of lung tissue were observed. The wet/dry ratio (W/D) of lung tissue were determined. Interleukin-6(IL-6), interleukin-10(IL-10) and transforming growth factor-B1 (TGF-B1) of serum and BALF were measured by ELISA. Low dose ceftazidime inhibits Penicillin-Binding Protein (PBP)-3 in Gram-negative bacteria, causing filament-formation, which is related to high endotoxin-releases in vitro, and possible high cytokine responses in vivo. High dose ceftazidime causes PBP-1 binding, inducing bacterial lysis. Earlier studies showed that continuous infusion of ceftazidime above 40 mg/kg prevents filament-formation, and leads to early high cytokine responses by a rapid lysis of bacteria. We hypothesized that, during filamentformation, endotoxin is retained in the bacterial cellwall, inducing lower initial cytokine releases. A consequence might be the risk of a postponed, but potentially more severe inflammatory response once bacteria are killed by further treatment.",11.720447363173427,3.702074891925267

Methods: Surveillance of Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) has been included in the mandatory healthcare-associated infection surveillance system for NHS acute Trusts in England since January 20041. Data are collected quarterly from the 169 acute Trusts in England that treat patients aged 65 years and over. The findings from the first year of mandatory surveillance are compared with the results from the national voluntary system of reporting and used to estimate the current burden of CDAD and assess the national trend. For the purposes of the mandatory surveillance scheme, microbiology laboratories were required to test diarrhoeal specimens for evidence of CDAD from all patients over 65 years old who have not been diagnosed with CDAD in the preceding four weeks. Diarrhoeal stools are defined as those that take the shape of their container. Non-diarrhoeal stools should not be tested for CDAD. Laboratories should test specimens for C. difficile toxin using either an immunoassay detecting both toxin A and toxin B, or a neutralised cell cytotoxicity assay. The method used should be subject to appropriate quality assurance. The mandatory surveillance scheme does not distinguish between hospital and community-acquired cases. Even cases considered to be community-acquired should be reported by the Trust in which they are detected. Results: During the period January-December 2004, the HPA received 44,488 reports of CDAD from 166 out of 169 acute NHS Trusts (two Trusts did not submit any data, and one Trust did not submit data for three quarters). Four Trusts had no cases to report. In contrast the national voluntary reporting system indicated that there were 33,493 cases in patients aged 65 years and above. The relative ascertainment in the nine regions is given in the attached figure. This indicates that the under ascertainment of the voluntary surveillance for CDAD was 32% in 2004.

Materials and methods: To be allowed a residence permit, all immigrants in Greece are screened for TB. Screening procedure includes TST, a chest X-ray and thorough physical examination. All immigrants screened for TB during a two-month period in 2005 were included in our study. Demographical data were recorded for all subjects. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression and Pearsons chi-square test for categorical variables, Student's t-test for normally distributed and Mann-Whitney U test for skewed numerical variables. Statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05. Results: A total of 237 immigrants were screened (172 males and 65 females). Mean age was 31.0 ± 10.6 years and mean time in Greece 2.8 ± 1.9 years. One-hundred twenty-one immigrants originated from Europe (51%), 109 (46%) from Asia and 7 (3%) from Africa. TST was positive in 41 subjects (17.3%), 28 males (16.2%) and 13 females (20%), p = 0.725. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of TST positivity in respect to origin. Among 86 subjects who developed a detectable skin induration, the presence of BCG scar was not associated with a greater TST reaction size (10.6 ± 6.7 mm vs. 11.6 ± 6.1 mm in subjects with and with no BCG scar, respectively, p = 0.552). Conclusions: The prevalence of positive TST among immigrants to Greece is not negligible. A BCG vaccination in the early childhood must not substantially alter the interpretation of TST in adults. Given the low risk of acquiring TBC after arrival in Greece, preventive therapy should be considered for all immigrants with positive skin test (TST), a clear chest X-ray and no recent exposure to a known source case of tuberculosis, after adjusting for the risk of adverse effects from chemoprophylactic agents.",10.371351510856703,3.1925321186095017

Previously, to examine the replication of SARS-CoV, various animal models were used which showed the symptoms of severe infection [43]. In contrast to SARS-CoV, no MERS-CoV pathogenesis was observed in small animals. Mice are not vulnerable to infection by MERS-coronavirus due to the non-compatibility of the DPP4 receptor [44]. As the entire genome of the 2019-novel coronavirus is more than 80% similar to the previous human SARS-like bat CoV, previously used animal models for SARS-CoV can be utilized to study the infectious pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The human ACE2 cell receptor is recognized by both SARS and Novel coronaviruses. Conclusively, TALEN or CRISPR-mediated genetically modified hamsters or other small animals can be utilized for the study of the pathogenicity of novel coronaviruses. SARS-CoV has been reported to replicate and cause severe disease in Rats (F344), where the sequence analysis revealed a mutation at spike glycoprotein [45]. Thus, it could be another suitable option to develop spike glycoprotein targeting therapeutics against novel coronaviruses.

KCDC risk assessment was categorized into 5 levels (“very low,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high”), and overall risk was determined [4]. The emergence of COVID-19, which started as clusters of pneumonia with unknown etiology in China at the end of 2019, was unique and thus, a good example for KCDC to conduct a series of risk assessments to evaluate the potential risk of importation, transmission, and the impact at the country-level.

A severe outbreak of SARS-CoV, which originated in China in 2002, spread swiftly and ultimately affected over 8000 humans within a few months.116 While the virus has been contained, its potential to reemerge and cause new outbreaks remains high, and the rVSV platform has been employed to create SARS-CoV vaccine candidates for such a future scenario. VSV-S expresses the immunogenic spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV between the G and the L gene of VSV. In a mouse model, vaccination with VSV-S induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than immunization with SARS-CoV and conferred protection as measured by low or undetectable SARS-CoV viral loads in the respiratory tract, even when challenged 4 months p.v. Using antisera from VSV-S vaccinated mice in naïve mice, it could further be shown that the protective effect was mediated by antibodies.117 This vaccine candidate was then attenuated by replacing VSV G with SARS-CoV S, resulting in ﻿VSVΔG-S. Immunogenicity of the replication-defective vector was surprisingly greater than the immunogenicity of VSV-S when applied i.m., an effect the authors argued that could be due to a higher expression of SARS-CoV S protein in VSVΔG-S, among others. In an analogous manner, VSVΔG was later used to create a MERS-CoV vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein (S), and VSVΔG-MERS displayed immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys.118 To date, no human clinical trials have been reported for VSV-based CoV vaccines and the WHO roadmap for MERS-CoV research and product development does not currently include rVSV-vectored vaccines in the port- folio of vectored vaccines.119",29.50650491136881,8.917644009356701

Authors and their affiliations,"In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus respiratory disease (called COVID-19) initiated in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was caused by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak spread from Wuhan to other cities in China and many other countries. WHO declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 , when the disease was reported in 114 countries. 1 The primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets that people cough, sneeze or exhale, and may also be spread via fomites. 2 SARS-CoV-2 is 82% similar to SARS coronavirus that caused an outbreak in 2003. 16-73% of patients with SARS were reported to have diarrhea in addition to respiratory symptoms 3 , and transmission of SARS via water droplets from faeces via air ventilation systems in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong was reported. 4 Diarrhea is also reported in a significant proportion of the COVID-19 cases and recent reports show that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in stool samples of COVID-19 cases. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was studied in a cluster of 9 cases and was 10 7 RNA copies/g faeces one week after symptom onset and decreased to 10 3 RNA copies/g three weeks after symptom onset. 10 In stool samples with high RNA copies, viable SARS-CoV-2 was detected. 11 Although it is unlikely that wastewater will become an important transmission pathway for coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 12 , increasing circulation of the virus in the population will increase the virus load into the sewer systems of our cities. It is important to collect information about the occurrence and fate of this new virus in sewage to understand if there is no risk to sewage workers, but also to determine if sewage surveillance 13 could be used to monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in our communities, that could complement current clinical surveillance, which is limited to the COVID-19 patients with the most severe symptoms. Sewage surveillance could also serve as early warning of (re-)emergence of COVID-19 in cities, much like the sewage surveillance for poliovirus that has been used for this purpose. 14 The objective of this investigation was to identify if SARS-CoV-2 is present in domestic wastewater of cities and a main airport during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands.",37.47679785960584,13.738206864528697

Université Laval. Quebec. Canada 5 Halim.maaroufi@ibis.ulaval.ca 6 7 ABSTRACT The novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and can cause 8 serious acute respiratory illness syndromes, often fatal, called covid-19. It is an urgent priority to 9 better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms that will help in the development of 10 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics that are very important to people health and socioeconomic 11 stability around the world. The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key 12 factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane 13 fusion. Here the analysis of CoV-2 S protein revealed in S1subunit a B56-binding LxxIxE-like 14 motif that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This motif is absent in SARS-15 CoV and MERS-CoV. PP2A is a major family of serine/threonine phosphatases in eukaryotic cells. 16 Phosphatases and kinases are big players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during 17 pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses use multiple strategies to target 18 PP2A in order to manipulate host's antiviral responses. The latest studies have indicated that 19 SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained inflammation in the host. Therefore, by controlling acute 20 inflammation; it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight 21 covid-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a 22 target for the development of a bioactive peptide and ligand inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.",29.223918082849472,9.679282127830088
