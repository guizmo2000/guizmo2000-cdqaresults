As the epidemic progresses, there remains little understanding of infant and childhood COVID-19 infections and their clinical picture. As of 22 February 2020, 77,043 cases of novel COVID-19 infections have been confirmed and 2,445 people have died (http:// 2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/). During this epidemic, four live-born infants were born in our medical center, to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection. Three of the four pregnant women gave birth by cesarean section due to concerns about symptomatic maternal infection. The other infant was born by vaginal delivery to a mother experiencing fever (highest temperature 38.3 • C), with a diagnostically confirmed infection. The most important question is whether the COVID-19 could be transmitted vertically to the fetus from the pregnant mother and cause a clinically significant infection. Recently, a finding from nine other cases suggested that there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy (1) . We believe this present report is the second case report on vertical transmission between COVID-19 pregnant women and their infants. Moreover, this report will focus more on infants.

Since January 2020, the number of COVID-19 infections has increased significantly and a global emergency has been declared by the WHO on January 31th [9] . The total reported infections by February 25th (08:30 h Norway time) had increased to 79,331 in at least 30 countries [10] , among which more than 97% are reported in mainland China [10] . The total death toll has reached to more than 2600 [10] , which surpasses by three times the total number of deaths during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [11] . In order to control the rapid spread of the COVID-19, the epidemic center, Wuhan, a city with more than 10 million residents, was placed on effective lockdown on January 23th and the lockdown measures were shortly after implemented in the whole of Hubei Province [12] . The number of city lockdowns in China had increased to more than 80 by the beginning of February. Besides, tourist sites were closed across the country, public gatherings were cancelled and people was encouraged to stay at home [13] . All school activities were suspended [13] . and instead, online platforms have been used for teaching and learning. The implementation of lockdown policies has effectively restricted both inbound and outbound transportation in Hubei Province [6] , and the mobility of people within the cities has been largely reduced [13] . In Wuhan, within two weeks, several temporary hospitals have been established to provide more clinical beds and medical service for the COVID-19 infection. This has led to significant logistics challenges in both forward and reverse directions. From the reverse logistics perspective, the rapidly increased amount of medical waste due to the COVID-19 outbreak needs to be collected and treated in a timely, safe and effective manner in order to minimize the virus spread and the risk to humans. Taking into account the real-world challenge faced in Wuhan, a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer linear program is modeled for the reverse logistics network design of medical waste management in epidemic outbreak, which aims at improving the decision-makings related to the temporary facilities and the transportation planning.

Both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that metronidazole decreases the levels of several cytokines, including IL8 (10-13), IL6 (10-15), IL1B (10-15), TNFα (11) (12) (13) (15) (16) (17) , IL12 (11, 13, 14) , and IFNγ (11, 14, 16) , as well as the levels of CRP (11, 12) and neutrophil count (11, 17, 18) . Interestingly, these parameters are shown to increase during the COVID-19 infection (5-7). Moreover, metronidazole could increase the number of circulatory lymphocytes (11, 17) and has lymphoproliferative properties, suggestive of its immunopotentiating effect (11, 19) . These immunomodulatory effects of metronidazole have been discussed in detail in a previously published review by Shakir et al. (11) . Furthermore, this medication could decrease neutrophil-generated reactive oxygen species during inflammation (11, 20) . Table 1 summarizes the effects of metronidazole on the immunopathological manifestations of the COVID-19 infection. Metronidazole, owing to its immunopharmacological behavior, plays a pivotal role in several essential biological processes. Based on the reported immunological manifestations of COVID-19 infection, it could serve as a potential candidate to counteract majority of the immunopathological features of the disease. Therefore, clinical trials with a large sample size are necessary to determine its efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 infection. ",28.697855650343868,14.055358102555502

Publication of reports that estimate geographic spread for the diseases in Fig. 1 are indicated by green arrows. The global epidemic history of Zika, for example, remains poorly understood. The challenge to accurately reconstruct the epidemic pathway of the virus is further complicated by its relatively unspecific clinical presentation.

For the other major outbreaks highlighted in Fig. 1 , estimates of the geographic origin were documented between 6 and 8 months after the first reports of human cases ( Fig. 1b-d ; Table 1 ). However, given the underlying ecological determinants of transmission that restrict the reproduction of the virus in the mosquito vector species, large areas can be excluded from the risk of local virus transmission.

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare. This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available. However, at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected, to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years, too. There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months.

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",31.047912504408632,14.423045185354209

Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program.

Many jurisdictions have imposed traveller screening in an effort to prevent importation of COVID-19 cases to unaffected areas. Some high-income countries have escalated control measures beyond screening-based containment policies, and now restrict or quarantine inbound travellers from countries known to be experiencing substantial community transmission. Meanwhile, in many other countries, screening remains the primary barrier to case importation (Guardian reporting team, 2020; Schengen Visa Info, 2020) . Even in countries with the resources to enforce quarantine measures, expanded arrival screening may be the first logical response as the source epidemic expands to regions outside China.

Here, we demonstrate that such dynamics are most powerfully investigated by combining phylogeographic history with empirical data on the patterns of human movement worldwide. Our analysis strongly suggests that air travel is key to global influenza spread, an intuitive result that has long been predicted by modeling studies (e.g. [5] ), but has, until now, remained difficult to obtain from empirical data. The dominant predictors of influenza spread will undoubtedly be scale-dependent, as indicated here by the importance of geographic distance as a predictor within more confined geographic areas (Fig. 2) , which may represent forms of human mobility other than air travel, such as workplace commuting [9] . This indicates that our statistical framework could also prove valuable in testing hypotheses at smaller scales, where the underlying spatial processes may be less obvious, provided adequate sequence and empirical movement data are available. One of the limitations of the current heterogeneous sampling of H3N2 sequences worldwide is that geographic partitions need to be adjusted to account for the number of samples per location, which results in regions of widely different areas and population sizes. More representative sampling across the globe, or within a more geographically confined area of interest, will allow for more appropriate geographic partitioning and may facilitate more detailed spatial hypothesis testing based on the associated demographic and mobility measures. In particular, if sequences were sampled appropriately then our inference method could incorporate the rich geographic data that is currently available as global gridded population data sets [34] . In addition, many of the predictors used here can be improved in accuracy and resolution, for example by accounting for seat occupancy and actual origin-destination flows in air traffic passenger fluxes.",23.21021176295199,10.893262729255866

Such geographic differences may be related to the uneven distribution of mental health service resources, which are clustered in and around big cities in economically booming areas in China [19] . The lack of locally available mental health service networks and mental health resources make it challenging to conduct MHL-related research in rural, remote or other less-developed regions. On the other hand, due to relatively low levels of education and the strong influence of traditional culture, people in these regions are more likely to have poorer MHL [48] , longer delays in receiving treatment, and more premature death related to mental disorders [49] .

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",35.48470319002743,16.485566350236102

Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases.

Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms.

CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] . Moreover, the pathological findings associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 showed abundant interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, dominated by lymphocytes, once again implying that the immune hyperactivation mechanisms are at least partially accountable for COVID-19 severity [17] .

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",28.16322818165588,12.372476909239577

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) . There is currently no definitive cure for COVID-19, and the treatment regimens prescribed for patients are the main treatments that have previously been effective in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and chloroquine phosphate is the * Corresponding Author: Ali Rismanbaf; Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Hezar Jerib Street, Isfahan, Iran.

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",29.592769593130438,12.34137368355772

Moreover, viral RNA has been detected in fecal and blood samples in later studies. According to WHO guideline, laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on a positive RT-PCR test. Target gene for diagnosis may be different by country. Accordingly, target genes for screening and confirmatory assays by RT-PCR are ORF1ab and N in Chinese laboratory protocol, while RdRP, E and N are checked in Germany. Furthermore, three targets in N gene are considered in the US protocol (40) . RT-PCR is an expensive test and no access to diagnostic facility during COVID-19 pandemic advocates conducting new researches on other diagnostic approaches such as Chest CT. However, results of recent studies in China demonstrate low specificity for this diagnostic approach (41) . As a critical point in diagnostic studies, accuracy of a new test is compared to the gold standard. This comparison resulted in lower values of diagnostic accuracy for the new test. On the other hand, the sensitivity and specificity of a test depend on the severity of cases, which may vary between different populations according to their type of surveillance system (42) . In the mentioned study that compared CT scan with RT-PCR as a gold standard, sensitivity of CT scan was appropriate (41) . However, the study population consisted of suspected cases and generalizability of the findings is questionable (43) . Furthermore, the large number of hospitalized cases due to false positive results by CT scan may increase the risk of transmission to healthy people. On the other hand, RT-PCR test may be subject to some limitations, especially in the earlier phase of an epidemic, as the specialists should be trained for running related procedures and interpretation of results. Moreover, false negative results due to either low quality of specimen in use or inadequate number of organisms in the samples are introduced as main challenges (44) . Results of a recent study on rapid IgM-IgG combined test revealed some limitation for RT-PCR test as a standard diagnostic method for COVID-19. The following limitations were indicated for RT-PCR test: long turnaround times, complex operation, and need for quality controlled laboratories, expensive equipment and trained specialists (38).",27.514396778092056,12.328078392119055

Compared with the previous two epidemics (SARS and MERS), the case fatality rate was lower and approximately 2% in COVID-19, and only less than 15% of patients would seek hospital services. However, the case fatality rate of SARS and MERS was 10% and 34%, respectively (18) . Results of a study in China revealed the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% for COVID-19 (27) and some studies reported case fatality rate of 0.9% in Beijing (28) . In another study, Jung and colleagues reported a confirmed case fatality risk of 5.3% to 8.4% for COVID-19 (23) . However, due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, there is a higher number of death cases in the recent pandemic (N=3043, up to 02 March 2020) compared to SARS and MERS (N=1871) (29) . There is a poor prognosis for the disease in middle and older aged patients (28) . In a study on 44672 confirmed cases in China, case fatality rate was highest in the group of over 80 years (14.77%), followed by the age group between 70 to 80 years (7.96%) and no mortality was reported in age group below 10 years (30) . Even though death outcome is uncommon in young people, a few deaths are reported in this age group in China and Iran. Availability of and access to healthcare facilities has likely contributed to increase in death outcome. As a probable explanation for the difference between fatality rate in Wuhan (3%) and other provinces (0.7%) in China, death rates are likely affected by shortage in health resources due to increasing number of patient who had sought diagnosis and treatment services in the early phase of the epidemic in Wuhan (31).",26.624242253509404,10.604444279861982

Secondly, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires two independent confirmatory laboratory tests, which should be taken at least 1 day apart. Our results showed that the lag correlation is shorter for the suspected than for laboratory-confirmed cases.

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.

COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality. We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households. 5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities. We need to continue to inform, advocate for, and empower local communities and to lobby governments and policymakers to ensure that tuberculosis, as well as COVID-19, remain high on the global agenda.

Subsequent budding of the viral particles from the capillary endothelium and damage to the endothelial lining can favor viral access to the brain ( Figure  1B) . Once within the milieu of the neuronal tissues, its interaction with ACE2 receptors (Figure 1C , D) expressed in neurons 2 can initiate a cycle of viral budding accompanied by neuronal damage without substantial inflammation as has been seen with cases of SARS-CoV 3 in the past. It is important to mention here that, long before the proposed anticipated neuronal damages occur, the endothelial ruptures in cerebral infections. The movement of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the cribriform plate close to the olfactory bulb can be an additional pathway that could enable the virus to reach and affect the brain.

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",36.990509962940635,13.912491083707955

Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] .

Some of the cougars were collected by hunters, and since there are geographic areas where cougar hunting is prohibited, cougar populations from these areas will likely be underrepresented. This could potentially distort the pattern of FIV structure we found if FIV structure is related to landscape features in areas with no observations. There are some discontinuities in the sampling distribution of cougars (Figure 1 ), and we would obviously fail to capture any FIV structuring in unsampled areas. Similarity in FIV sequences on different sides of sampling discontinuities, however, suggests a lack of unmeasured FIV structure. We also assumed the sample was representative in terms of FIV status, such that cougar behavior was not altered significantly by FIV-positive status to result in different hunted rates by FIV status. There is no way to verify this assumption, but the fact that the crude FIV prevalence for the sample (28%) is very similar to the overall estimated prevalence in the Americas (30%) gives some measure of confidence that this is not a major issue with these data. While we do not have a spatially uniform sampling plan, due to local variations in cougar presence and hunting regulations as noted above, we do not anticipate differential effects between FIV positive and FIV negative groups. As a result, local comparisons are valid, but may vary in local power to detect differences depending on the local sample sizes relative to sample sizes from other areas. Our goal in the descriptive analysis of FIV was to determine whether the patterns of FIV positive and FIV negative cougars differ from one another, not to determine whether either provides an unbiased estimate of the spatial distribution of cougars. Another drawback of this study is not having temporal data to supplement the geographic data.

All pharmacy professionals should keep up to date, and be familiar, with the latest CoV prevention and treatment guidelines, which are rapidly changing. 1 Several resources are available to help pharmacists worldwide care for individuals and communities, such as the American Pharmacists' Association (APhA) resource centre webpage, which provides the latest information from federal agencies and a decision-tree document that can be used to assist pharmacists in talking to individuals with different levels of COVID-19 risk. The APhA has also recently issued a tool --Preparedness and Prevention Guidance during Coronavirus Pandemic --to help pharmacists be prepared. 3 For preparing clinicians to respond to health threats and emergencies related to disease outbreaks and disasters, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) is a vital information source. 3 In addition, many reference documents are now being made available to pharmacists so they can have access to the latest updates regarding COVID-19 management. The American Society of Hospital Pharmacists (ASHP) has recently initiated a comprehensive online resource that includes most of the COVID-19-related pharmacy information and free, 60-day open access to ASHP drug information. 4 It should be noted that pharmacists should regularly review these pharmaceutical recommendations because changes are expected as information about the virus accumulates. Below are directions to some of these online resources: patients, they need to pay attention to protecting themselves. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthcare staff wear appropriate eye protection, surgical masks, long-sleeved gowns and gloves when entering a room containing suspected or confirmed COVID-19-infected individuals. WHO has also recommended using a particulate respirator that is at least as protective as a US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified N95 when performing aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation or manual ventilation before intubation or bronchoscopy). 5 However, self-isolation of pharmacists who have been in contact with suspected COVID-19 individuals are not obliged to wear these unless otherwise ordered by health protection professionals. 6",31.8516700946211,14.134108894966214

Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread rapidly around the globe, including Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. 1 The 2019 novel coronavirus is likely similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. They belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and can cause severe respiratory disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory failure. 2 Tracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation is the mainstay therapy to correct hypoxaemia. Preoxygenation with the standard bag-valve mask oxygenation followed by rapid-sequence intubation has been proposed in non-severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation to reduce the risk of aspiration and desaturation. However, a previous study reported that 23% of patients had SpO 2 <90% during intubation. 3 Thus far, more than 80000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 has been described, including in many healthcare workers. 4, 5 Rapid-sequence fibreoptic bronchoscopic tracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may reduce the risk of viral spread. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) during fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared with standard mask oxygenation (SMO).

However, using the statistics method, the P value was shown to be beyond the confidence interval. Accordingly, this indicates that the ENC value was not influenced by the genogroups. Finally, we determined the possible role of geographic distribution on the PEDV codon usage (Fig. 4C) . Most of the studied strains were isolated from either Asia or America. Only one strain (CV777) was isolated from the UK (Rosenberg et al., 1977) ; this strain was not included our analysis.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases. [7] [8] [9] More recent descriptions of patients in China also noted around 10% of patients were also noted to have elevated total bilirubin levels. 8 Gastroenterologists should be aware of these potential gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.",28.598285402342626,13.121742689529787

At the beginning of the epidemic, COVID-19 cases were mostly observed among elderly people. 12 As the epidemic progressed, we observed a further increase in number of cases among people aged 65 years and older, as well as an increase among younger individuals (<18 years). Since Jan 28, 2020, however, the proportion of confirmed cases that are in people younger than 18 years is still only about 5%, although this age group represents approximately 20% of the Chinese population. 13 From the data available here, it is not possible to ascertain whether younger individuals have a reduced risk of infection or an increased propensity for a milder clinical outcome of infection (thus resulting in a lower rate of detection). Schools in China were closed for most of the epidemic because of the 2020 Chinese New Year holidays; 14 given studies 15 showing that children record the largest number of contacts among all age groups on a regular weekday due to contacts at schools, it is possible that children were less exposed than normal during this time. It is unclear whether nationwide school holidays contributed to the low proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases among school-age individuals and whether reopening of schools will lead to a change in the transmission patterns of COVID-19. 16 At the beginning of the epidemic, a disproportionate fraction of COVID-19 cases were male. 12 As of Feb 17, 2020, however, we observed about the same number of cases among men and women (51% of cases are male).

Evidence to date has suggested rapid spread of the virus: at the time of writing, imported cases have been reported in 143 countries and territories, including Singapore. 243 confirmed cases have been reported in Singapore; however, this number is expected to increase substantially in the following weeks. In 2003, SARS-CoV, which also originated from mainland China, established locally, causing 33 deaths after 238 cases were confirmed. Therefore, there is considerable concern since 3204 deaths and 81 048 cases of COVID-19 have already been confirmed in mainland China, which surpasses the numbers observed in the SARS-CoV outbreak. 2020 Lunar New Year celebrations have now ended, marking a period of extensive travel between China and Singapore, and a corresponding high risk for case importation. Despite heightened surveillance and isolation of individuals suspected to have COVID-19 and confirmed cases, the risk is ongoing, with the number of cases continuing to increase in Singapore.

Efforts have been made to search for a reservoir host or intermediate carriers from which the infection may have spread to humans. Initial reports identified two species of snakes that could be a possible reservoir of the COVID-19. However, to date, there has been no consistent evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds [10, 18] . Genomic sequence analysis of COVID-19 showed 88% identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [19, 20] , indicating that mammals are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans. Several reports have suggested that person-to-person transmission is a likely route for spreading COVID-19 infection. This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan [13, 21] . Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth. This is important because pregnant mothers are relatively more susceptible to infection by respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia (https://www.thelancet.com, DOI:https://doi.org/10. 1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3).",30.200061961925037,12.52253184688151

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia.

The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to numerous countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study reveals that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We find a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship is confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence reveals that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirm the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases.

This hypothesis has led some European countries to produce initial policies relying on decreased transmission rates during the summer months, 3 and the belief that African countries will face smaller epidemics than their European counterparts. However, no strong evidence base exists for such claims; SARS-CoV-2 might have simply arrived later to warmer countries. We used data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Baltimore, MD, USA) to plot the cumulative number of cases since the diagnosis of both the first patient and the first five patients by country, both in Europe and Africa (figure). Although the first confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred later in west Africa than in Europe, once these first cases were confirmed in west Africa, the expansion in the number of confirmed COVID-19 was rapid. Of particular concern are Burkina Faso and Senegal, which saw sharp increases in the number of cases soon after the initial cases were confirmed in these countries. Cases in both countries might evolve in a similar way to what was observed in European countries with the most expansive epidemics (ie, Italy and Spain, where SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly after case number five was detected). Senegal also confirmed its first three cases of community transmission on March 21, 4 suggesting more cases in this country than the 119 confirmed on March 27.",27.901503025602683,11.84413261978724

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh reported human-infecting member of the family Coronaviridae, which also includes SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. It has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. Both the clinical and the epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and high mortality. About 16%-21% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill, with a 2%-3% mortality rate [1, 4] . However, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to identify effective antiviral agents to combat the disease and explore the clinical effect of antiviral drugs.",27.06629781593964,12.009719769502977

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",29.304017018394234,12.426660717418587

How can the past assist in the real-time management of the crisis? What insights can be gleaned from the ongoing epidemic for future disease preparedness and prevention? Lurking in the background of these interrogatives is a more or less explicit accusation: why haven't past lessons been learned? The gist of some commentaries seems to be: ""there is almost nothing surprising about this pandemic"". 2 The history-as-lessons approach pivots on the assumption that epidemics are structurally comparable events, wherever and whenever they take place. The COVID-19 outbreak ""creates a sense of déjà vu"" with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 3 Citing early estimates of the disease's infectiousness, based on an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, 4 comparisons have been drawn with the 1918-19 influenza pandemic. 5 Although in some respects the outbreak of COVID-19 presents a compelling argument for why history matters, there are problems with analogical views of the past because they constrain our ability to grasp the complex place-and-time-specific variables that drive contemporary disease emergence. A lessons approach to epidemics produces what Kenneth Burke, borrowing from the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen, called ""trained incapacity""-""that state of affairs whereby one's very abilities can function as blindnesses"". 6 Habitual modes of thinking can diminish our capacity to make lateral connections. When the present is viewed through the lens of former disease outbreaks, we typically focus on similitudes and overlook important differences. In other words, analogies create blind spots. As Burke commented, ""a way of seeing is also a way of not seeing-a focus on object A involves a neglect of object B"". 6 A lessons approach to the past, which usually comes from outside the discipline of history, reinforces an idea of the past as a series of interlinked crises that offer instructive insights into cause and effect. 7 Historians need to push back against easy analogies and examine the specific contexts of outbreaks, asking, for example, in what ways SARS and COVID-19 are in fact comparable.

To limit the virus spread, those in the USA are canceling both smaller (∼100 people) and large meetings, researchers are limiting their travel both overseas and within the country, and student college and graduate school visit weekends are being postponed or stopped altogether. Still, there is much uncertainty about how to proceed and what other measures should be taken. Since the outbreak began in China, Chinese scientists have already faced many of the questions that those of us in other locations are now asking. We therefore asked several Chinese scientists to discuss the strategies that they are pursuing to limit the impact of the virus both on their research and on society. Some of the actions taken by the scientists and the government under this extreme situation may have a long-term influence and shift our future research and funding paradigm. We anticipate that their perspectives will be valuable to the community. global lifethreatening concern in recent days. The war against COVID-19 there has now reached the most critical moment, as confirmed COVID-19 cases have peaked for several days, and almost all the people in Wuhan City have been screened for suspected case identification (as of late February). We cannot imagine how people there are sacrificing to control the spread of COVID-19. As alumni of Wuhan University that is located in the center of Wuhan city, we became deeply saddened and worried as we watched the entire city cope with an unprecedented emergency situation. We wanted to provide a glimpse of what chemical biologists have been working on, from the perspective of scientists in China. In the past 40 days, we have heard more stories of hope and resilience than of worry and grief in China, where 1.4 billion people are doing their best to bring this serious outbreak under control. Right now, the epidemic situation outside Hubei is gradually improving, and the situation inside Hubei has shown signs of stabilization. It is noteworthy that although it is mandated that most people have to stay at home as a quarantine procedure, scientists in China have been increasingly devoted to combating COVID-19, with several clinical trials currently underway. As for scientists throughout the world, researchers in China are making extraordinary efforts toward rapid advancement of diagnostic and treatment approaches, and are doing so under highly challenging personal circumstances with extensive restrictions on not only travel, but day-to-day activities. As mentioned by WHO officers, Chinese scientists have been extremely professional in the face of this epidemic and have made their findings rapidly available to researchers around the world to coordinate global efforts to characterize, treat, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. One team led by Yongzhen Zhang from Fudan University completed the deep sequencing of COVID-19 and made its whole genome sequence publicly available on January 10, 2020. 1 Medical experts, virologists, structural biologists, and medicinal chemists have made significant contributions in areas such as epidemic prevention and control, patient treatment, virus classification and traceability, structure analysis, and clinical drug development. The current progress relied on the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the dedication of scientific researchers. During the epidemic, almost all industries not related to any antiepidemic efforts were halted due to the lock down of transportation and lack of manpower. It has been extremely difficult to complete highlevel scientific research under such an extreme situation.",26.361750511553513,11.746825925389249

These can move viruses across geographic barriers and bring into contact with previously isolated populations. This process has contributed to the emergence and reemergence of viral epidemics such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya.

Although contact with participants is facilitated through the internet, the process of designing the measurement tool, collecting data through interaction with participants, and analyzing the data are similar to traditional data collection methods. Crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining services, ideas, or content from a large, undefined group of volunteers or part-time workers through a flexible open call. The volunteers and part-time workers have varying degrees of experience, knowledge, and skills. Most often, researchers use crowdsourcing to complete large, monotonous tasks or recruit large numbers of survey participants. Amazon Mechanical Turk, Google Consumer Surveys, and proprietary systems or websites are the most common methods of crowdsourcing. Amazon Mechanical Turk is an online multi-use crowdsourcing platform hosted through Amazon where users are recruited to answer surveys or complete repetitious tasks for a small amount of money. Google Consumer Surveys is another crowdsourcing platform used to recruit a large number of participants for short surveys (< 10 questions) (Sell, Goldberg, & Conron, 2015) . Samples may be constructed to be nationally-representative based on age, gender, and geographic distribution of respondents. However, participants tend to be younger and more technologically savvy than the general population. Participants who complete surveys receive micropayments ($1 or less) in the form of Google Play Store credit. Crowdsourcing tends to be cost-effective, facilitate easy recruitment, and allow for access to a geographically diverse sample. However, there may be bias in the results of studies using Amazon Mechanical Turk and Google Consumer Surveys related to varying access to the internet within a population so older adults, individuals with lower socioeconomic status, and others may be underrepresented (Bethlehem, 2010) .",29.40015513321665,15.01175049461243

Hematology and clinical chemistry differences also have been demonstrated in these two populations. In rhesus macaques, such dependence on genetic background is understood and used to guide research. Although cynomolgus monkeys are the most commonly used in the development of biopharmaceuticals such as mAbs and recombinant proteins, there is relatively little information on their genome in public domain databases. Nevertheless, cynomolgus monkeys originate from three different populations (e.g., Indochina, insular Asia and the Philippines, and Mauritius) with own genetic features. Animals from Mauritius and the Philippines exhibit potentially lower genetic diversity, even for genes involved in immune response [11] . Differences in the gene sequences of some target proteins have been encountered within cynomolgus monkeys sourced from different geographic origins (e.g., China, the Philippines, Mauritius), raising concerns that certain genetic variants might result in a loss or gain of pharmacologic responses in the cynomolgus monkey colony used for toxicology studies. Phenotypic differences in cynomolgus monkeys of diverse geographic origin, in particular for immune system functions, are well established, as illustrated by the diverse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genetics of cynomolgus monkey from different geographic origin [12, 13] .

For instance, age is the strongest risk factor for CVD and the effect of aging on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 suceptibility and severity. Exemplary of this, the effect of age on the immune system is exemplified by low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 who receive the influenza vaccine (30, 31) . Other traditional CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia impact immune function, and conversely, dysregulated immunologic status corresponds with elevated risk of incident CVD (32) (33) (34) (35) . Thus, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis. An increased frequency of adverse CVD events post COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections such as influenza with mechanistic underpinnings which are complex, multi-factorial, and bi-directional (36, 37) . In addition, COVID-19 infection may trigger pathways unique to this pathogen which contribute to outcomes in CVD patients. For instance, higher expression of ACE2 in patients with hypertension and CVD has been postulated to enhance susceptibility to SARS-CoV2, although the data are conflicting and without clear suggestion for treatment ( Figure 1 ) (5) .

Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",27.842287138590468,13.4227295422765

A total of 24 urine samples, previously determined positive for C. trachomatis using the original BUGS'n BEADS TM method, were analysed using the new preparation protocols in combination with the BDProbeTec detection system for C. trachomatis. The amplification control (AC) in the BDProbeTec kit was included for the new method to reveal any potential inhibition. Results: All 24 samples were positive with the new sample preparation protocol indicating that sensitivity is not reduced in comparison with the original BUGS'n BEADS TM procedure. Moreover, no inhibition was encountered for any of the urine samples as demonstrated by the AC MOTA values, which were all above the cut-off value as defined for the BDProbeTec detection kit.

Yet little is known about changes in the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these strains. Has CA-MRSA replaced the traditional hospital-acquired MRSA to become the new hospital flora, as manifested by a new pattern of antibiotic susceptibility? Another growing concern is glycopeptide heteroresistance. The incidence of MRSA with higher vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentration (vanc-MIC) is unknown. We sought to address these two issues in our epidemiologic study. Methods: Microbiology data for all MRSA isolates at our hospital from September 1, 2004 to March 1, 2005 were analysed. Sample location and isolates' antibiotic susceptibility and vanc-MIC were compiled. Results: Over the 6 months period, 1023 MRSA were isolated. Nasal cultures were not included and recurrent infections counted only once. Only 32 (3%) of the 1023 isolates were found to be resistant to 3 or more antibiotics, in addition to the beta lactams. 188 isolates (18.4%) were found to have a vanc-MIC of 2. There were no isolates with vanc-MIC greater than 2. Of those 188.69 (36.7%) came from patients in the emergency department or primary care clinics. Only 9 (4.8%) of the 188 isolates were found to be multi-drug resistant. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that, at our institution, MRSA antibiotic susceptibility resemble that of CA-MRSA. Higher vancomycin MIC among MRSA is seen with increasing frequency. Follow-up studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.",7.922180763085132,8.017885401765312

Methods: Data were collected retrospectively from our computerized records from 1January 2000 through 31 October 2005. Potentially skin contaminants, including episodes caused by only one positive blood culture yielding coagulase-negative staphylococci were excluded. Multiple cultures of the same species were considered to be a single infection. Results: During the study period there were 1321 episodes of BSIs. Aerobic gram-positive organisms accounted for 44% of cases, aerobic gram-negative organisms accounted for 46%, 4% were caused by fungi and 6% were caused by a diversity of other organisms, including anaerobes. The most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (26%), Klebsiella spp. (11.5%), S. aureus (10.2%) and Acinetobacter spp. (9.5%). Resistance rates for most pathogens increased gradually and strikingly during this period. From 2000 to 2005 the rate of MRSA increased from 59% to 77% (an increase of 30.5%), the rate of resistance of Klebsiella to 3rd generation cephalosporins increased from 42% to 70% (an increase of 66.6%), and resistances of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter to imipenem increased from 20% to 37% (an increase of 85%) and from 40% to 78% (an increase of 95%), respectively. Multiple drug resistance among Acinetobacter spp. during the study period ranged from 80% to 100%. Surprisingly, rates of VRE remained low (mean: 2.2%, range 0%-6%) Conclusions: These data may allow clinicians to better target empirical therapy for bloodstream infections in the intensive care unit as well as to understand the dangerous relationship between antibiotic use and resistance in this setting. Objectives: In order to identify, assess and apply relevant evidence for better health care decision-making, our study was addressed to evaluate whether Pseudomonas aeruginosa associated nosocomial infections (NI) in intensive care units (ICUs) originate mainly from patients' endogenous flora or from exogenous cross-transmission, by determining: i) the occurrence of P. aeruginosa carriage on admission; ii) the ICU-acquired P. aeruginosa infection and colonisation rates, by site; iii) the impact of cross-transmission using molecular typing data of the involved microrganisms. Methods: A six months active surveillance survey was performed at the ICU of an Italian Hospital, in accordance with the HELICS protocol. Carriage and colonization definitions were as described by Bertrand et al. (2001) . Molecular typing was performed by macro restriction analysis of the SpeIdigested genomic DNA. Interpretation of genomic relatedness was performed using well-established criteria. The presence of two indistinguishable strains in two patients was considered one episode of cross-transmission. Results: During the survey period a total of 123 patients were admitted to the ICU. The incidence of P. aeruginosa carriage and colonization/infection on admission was 1.6% and 2.4% patients, respectively. The ICU-acquired colonization rate was 29.4% patients and the incidence density was 16.1& patientdays. The ICU-acquired infection rate was 36.1% patients and the incidence density was 19.8& patient-days. ICU-acquired pneumonia (VAP) was confirmed to be the first P. aeruginosaspecific infection type (51.2%), followed by UTI and local CVC related infections (18.6% each). Nineteen distinct clones were identified by macro restriction analysis. The impact of P. aeruginosa cross-infection was estimated to be at least 47.1%, but this figure was higher when cross-colonization was included (59.5%), thus defining the preventable proportion of all P. aeruginosa-sustained cross-transmission episodes. Conclusions: P. aeruginosa infection in ICUs has been suggested to represent the tip of an iceberg, whereas colonization reflects the submerged part. The epidemiological scenario depicted by our analysis shows those cross-transmission is an important means of P. aeruginosa infection and highlight the occurrence of a silent epidemic mainly sustained by a multiresistant clone, that in the absence of epidemiologic screening would have remained the submerged part of the iceberg.",9.21287398143619,6.844502810750439

Lehours, A. Menard, J. Sarlangue, C. Laguente, C.H. Bebear, F. Megraud, B. De Barbeyrac (Bordeaux, FR) Objective: Whooping cough affects now young adults and teenagers, thus being able to contaminate infants unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. In this population, it evolves readily into atypical or severe forms difficult to diagnose and a biological confirmation is necessary. Thus molecular techniques represent invaluable tools. Here, we describe a real-time PCR assay for the identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in clinical specimens Methods: The available IS481 sequences of B. pertussis were aligned to identify conserved regions for the primer design. Primers for the detection of B. parapertussis were designed on the IS1001 sequence. A universal PCR targeting the 16S rDNA gene was also developed to be used as a control for extraction and for absence of PCR inhibitors. The PCR primers sets were tested on DNA extracted from the Bordetella species, and from diverse bacterial species commonly found in humans. The SYBR GreenÒ real-time PCR amplification and melting curve (Tm) analysis were carried out in an ABI PRISMÒ 7000 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems), and followed by a melting program. A retrospective study was performed on positive (n = 19) and negative (n = 13) nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). We tested prospectively 131 NPA received between April 2004 and November 2005. Results: When using the control strains, only DNA extracted from B. pertussis and B. parapertussis led to amplification, demonstrating the specificity of these two PCRs. Melting curve analysis of the amplicons from B. pertussis and B. parapertussis control strains exhibited Tm of approximately 79°C and 86°C, respectively. Serial dilutions of the extracted DNA from bacterial suspensions were tested using this assay and the regression curve was linear from 105 to 1 bacterial genome with slopes closed to that of the maximum efficiency. For the retrospective analysis, the 19 positive samples were all positive for B. pertussis, and no peak appeared for the 13 negative samples. Prospectively, this assay allowed the detection of 21 positive clinical samples (18 B. pertussis, 3 B. parapertussis), among these 14 could not have been isolated by culture. Conclusion: We have developed a new real-time PCR for the identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis targeting the IS sequences. This method, which uses the SYBR green chemistry and analysis of the melting point, is rapid, sensitive and specific, and can be easily implemented in a setting where a real time PCR apparatus is available.",8.447521302816488,6.775714871089683

Method: A total of 2094 subjects were randomly selected from 26 health centres' areas in Diyarbakir, Antalya and Samsun between February 2000 and October 2001. There were no statistically significant differences between provinces by age group, gender and residence (P > 0.05).

Statistical analyses were done with qui-square test, Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA, and logistic regression analysis using SPSS 10.0 for windows and the special software prepared using Visual Basic 6.0 and Access. Results: The women were divided into three age groups, 15-19, 20-39 and 40-49. Among 20-39 years-old women (n = 205), tetanus antibody level was higher in women with 1-3 children than those without children, demonstrating the effectiveness of the pregnant vaccination.

Based on these data women aged 20-39 years old are accepted as childbearing aged for analysis. The protective antibody level among 20-39-year-old was 74.7%, and the subjects who received more than two single-type tetanus vaccine doses were 58.8%. Among the provinces studied, Antalya had the highest immunity (P = 0.024). The percentages of the protective antibody level among women 20-39-year-ages were 86.6% in Antalya, 54.8% in Diyarbakir and 78.7% in Samsun. There was an inverse association between the percentage of the immunity level and age (P = 0.002). Conclusion: Although pregnant vaccination seemed to be effective, the tetanus immunity among women of childbearing age was not enough. There is a need to reinforce the pregnant vaccination through intensive antenatal care services and encouraging pregnant women to receive these services. Objectives: In Turkey, whole cell pertussis vaccine is administered to 2, 3, 4 months olds and a booster to 16-24 month-old children with a coverage of 83%. Regarding the life-span of antibodies which is 5-12 years and vaccine efficacy that is around 80%, school children, adolescents, and adults become vulnerable to the infection. The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of acute/recent infection in older individuals and the threat pertussis infection poses for infants. We also wanted to measure the antibody levels in chilbearing aged women to estimate the frequency of passively acquired protective antibodies in newborns. Methods: Questionnaires and blood specimens were collected from 2085 healthy individuals in three provinces from diverse regions of Turkey. The age groups were between 6 months old and >60 years old. There were no statistically significant differences in numbers of the subjects based on age group, gender, and residence (p > 0.05). The IgG anti-PT antibody was measured by in-house ELISA, 50-99 ELISA Unit (EU)/ml and ‡100 EU/ml were evaluated as acute and/or recent infection, ‡10 EU/ml for protective level and ‡30 EU/ml for chilbearing age women (n = 406) to protect their babies until the first dose of vaccine in 2nd month. Statistical analysis were done by SPSS 10.0 for Windows, Chi-square test and Pearson Correlation.",8.85420686138608,6.038047120437307

Methods: Retrospective study of 1074 adult patients admitted to a liver intensive care unit for more than 24 hours between January 2003 and July 2005. APACHE II and risk score on admission, clinical data relating to aetiology of liver failure, transplantation, mortality were collected in addition to blood culture organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. Standard criteria were adopted for definition of bacteraemia. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to determine associations between categorical variables. Results: 209 patients (19.5%) had at one or more bacteraemia with a total of 403 isolates including 14 repeat episodes with the same species. The mean time from admission to the LICU to first significant bacteraemia was 10.9 days. 170 isolates were Gram positive, 206 Gram negative and 27 were yeasts. The median time from to first bacteraemia for different organisms was as follows; Escherichia coli and meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (8.5 days) Enterococcus faecalis (9 days), Multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii (9.5 days), MRSA, coagulase-negative staphylococci, yeasts and Enterococcus faecium (11 days), Klebsiella sp. (12 days), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (13.5 days), Enterobacter sp (19 days) and Pseudomonas sp (22.5 days). For a number of organisms this difference reached statistical significance. Mean APACHE II scores on admission were 21.2 those who developed a bacteraemia compared with 13.8 for those who did not. Conclusions: Compared with earlier studies at the same centre these data suggest significant differences in the timing and sequence of organisms isolated from septic patients on our LICU. In this study infections with members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-positive organisms appeared later. This may reflect changes in the prevalence of different species or strains and/or the impact of early pre-emptive use of antibiotics on the development of infection in liver failure patients. The significance of this in terms of management of sepsis is discussed.",9.646571057668943,5.708430868557162

Prior to April 2005, sera from all atypical pneumonia serology requests were analysed for antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Coxiella burnetti. (Legionella pneumophila is detected using a urinary antigen test and not included in this study.) However, tests on acute-stage sera can neither exclude a specific aetiology by a negative result nor firmly establish it by detecting antibody in an early sample. Tests on paired sera are more useful but the inherent delay reduces the value of a result for case management. Methods: From April 2005, clinicians were requested to provide details on the date of onset of patients' symptoms. Samples taken less than seven days from the onset of symptoms or those with no date of onset were not tested but saved at -20 o C for seven days and a report issued stating 'Serum saved.

Among these are nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). NTM are ubiquitous micro-organisms, but geographic differences in their prevalence exist [1] . The present study was done to determine the prevalence of NTM in the adult CF-patients attending the university hospital of Leuven (Belgium). Methods: During an 18 month period (February 2004 until June 2005 sputum samples were obtained from 83 adult CF patients while attending the outpatient clinic. These samples were decontaminated using the NALC-NaOH method as described by the American Society for Microbiology [2] . The Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) (Becton Dickinson, USA) was used as a culture medium with incubation for 6 weeks in BACTEC MGIT 960 (Becton Dickinson, USA). In the case of overgrowth with micro-organisms other than mycobacteria, a second decontamination following the method described by Bange et al. [3] was performed on samples indicated by the clinician. Empyema necessitatis (EN) is a rarely seen infection of soft tissue, which is formed by the spontaneous drainage of empyema through the parietal pleura. Although the most common site is subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall, it may include esophagus, breast, retroperitoneum, pericardium, groin and vertebral column. We present a patient with ES of chest wall and retroperitoneal space with psoas abscess complicated by untreated tuberculous empyema. A 21-year-old male patient was admitted with two months history of two growing masses on the left posterolateral chest wall and left lumber area following a left chest pain. Physical examination revealed fluctuating, 6 cm diameter, fixed, painful two swellings and diminished pulmonary sounds on the left hemithorax. Chest xray disclosed disclosure of the left costadiaphragmatic sinus and narrowing of the left intercostals spaces. Chest CT scan revealed a subcutaneous, 12·6·8 cm in diameter, loculated collection of high density fluid on the left lateral chest associated with pleural space and a multiloculated, 15·12·8 cm in diameter fluid collection between paraspinal musculature and lying into the psoas muscle in the retroperitoneum. Thoracenthesis revealed an empyematous fluid with negative nonspecific culture and the culture of aspiration of the thoracic wall mass was also negative for any nonspecific bacilli. Laboratory examination was normal except a mild leucocytosis and an increased ESR of 136 mm/ hour. Left thoracotomy was performed with a diagnosis of ES. Purulent collections in the pleural space and in the abscess formations within thoracic wall and retroperitoneum were aspirated and later the patient underwent resection of the destructed tissues and left pleural decortication. The procedure was completed with a placement of the drainage tubes into the pleural, abdominal wall and retroperitoneal spaces. Histopathological examination of the resected tissues and pleura confirmed granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis. INH, RIF, EMB and PZA were given to the patient for two months and the treatment was continued for additional 7 months with INH and RIF. After 9 months of therapy the patient was in good health. EN is a well-known, however, extremely rare complication of the tuberculous empyema. Although the morbidity and mortality were high It is possible to treat with appropriate surgical debridement, drainage and antituberculous treatment without sequelas.",7.95545001058519,4.751772938470632

Firstly, the information in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak was preliminary and very limited, mainly since COVID-19 was a new emerging disease, and data from the Chinese government was the main source of information of this novel coronavirus. Thus, we conducted several risk assessments with the ongoing available evidence, in a very short period of time as the situation evolved rapidly. Therefore, the estimation was very likely to be subjective in nature. Secondly, the risk assessment tool was not strictly applied to this novel pathogen as critical information was missing and had to be estimated with limited confirmed evidence. Thus, initial evaluation of this virus pathogenesis was likely to be subjective, and was the one of major factors that needed to be considered when conducting the risk assessment. Once more scientific evidence and knowledge becomes available after the end of this pandemic, overall review procedures and evaluation mechanisms need to be developed to improve and to minimize the limitations of the existing risk assessments by the Korea CDC.",21.582804779340105,10.901986788754908

To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using the available information. For the probability of certain public health events, risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC risk assessment was categorized into 5 levels (“very low,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high”), and overall risk was determined [4]. The emergence of COVID-19, which started as clusters of pneumonia with unknown etiology in China at the end of 2019, was unique and thus, a good example for KCDC to conduct a series of risk assessments to evaluate the potential risk of importation, transmission, and the impact at the country-level.

As sample's viral load decreases, however, gradual increase of the entire coverage bias was observed with their protocol. Although such phenomenon is normally expected in multiplexed PCR for low-copy templates, we observed that coverages for the two particular PCR amplicons, 18 and 76, which correspond to the genomic regions coding for the nsp3 in ORF1a and S protein, respectively, decays far more rapidly than other targets. In our experience so far, low to absolute-zero depth for those two amplicons tends to be most frequent bottle neck for completion of all targeted genomic regions from samples with middle to low viral load (Ct > 27). This low coverage issue at the amplicons 18 and 76 are also seen in data published from other groups (e.g. https://cadde.s3.climb.ac.uk/covid-19/BR1.sorted.bam).",14.922878514078917,8.576719597599586

Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 . In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public-health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach. Method: Several techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion: T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.",16.028358779363842,8.56912829747255
