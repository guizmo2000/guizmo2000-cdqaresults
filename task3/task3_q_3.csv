Current evidence suggests that the virus originated from wild animals and birds (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/) [2] . To date, more than 2,800 deaths and 87,000 confirmed positive cases have been reported around the world, making COVID-19 a major health concern. As a first line of treatment, along with the antiviral drugs, clinicians are using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the S1 domain of the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein [1] . Very recently (25 January 2020) the first and complete genome sequence of COVID-19 was deposited in the NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3) providing the key to the likely structure and glycosylation pattern of the viral proteins and consequent mode of interaction with the host cell. Similar to most other coronaviruses, the outer membrane spike glycoprotein, known for its glycosylation [3] , is the prime host interacting protein with host cell targets (such as ACE2, CD26, Ezrin, cyclophilins and other cell adhesion factors) important for cell adhesion and virulence [4, 5] . However, the specific host cell factors or proteins that facilitate the novel COVID-19 remain elusive. The current study was thus undertaken to predict the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein structure and glycan shield pattern that has great implications for understanding the viral camouflage and mode of cell entry, potentially assisting the development of new vaccines, antibodies, small-molecule drugs and screening of the human host targets.",33.45197685631236,16.486657003812415

MERS-CoV circulates extensively in dromedary populations causing no impactful disease. Human infection, however, is associated with a measured case fatality ratio of around 35% (World Health Organisation, 2018a). Following spill-over events, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is relatively inefficient and limited to close, unprotected contact environments such as hospitals (Breban et al., 2013; Cauchemez et al., 2013) . Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences isolated from dromedaries and humans indicates that hundreds of camel-to-human spill-over events are likely to have occurred since 2012 .

The infection has spread locally in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated on Jan 23, 2020. More than 500 patients infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China have been reported between Jan 1 and Feb 14, 2020.

Depending on the CFR value, the government response toward COVID-19 may vary, and estimates of CFR can also influence the strictness of policy judgement and the extent of containment and mitigation measures.

[20] This requirement may provide a potential 'window of opportunity' for immunological targeting of the pathogen within the animal transmission species, thereby stemming its continued zoonotic flow prior to acquisition of full adaptation to humans. Self-disseminating vaccines are a vaccine strategy that may in some instances be better suited than conventional vaccines to immunologically contain emerging pathogens within their non-human host in challenging under-resourced 'hotspots'. Disseminating vaccines are designed to exploit the ability of replicating virus-based vectors to spread through their animal host populations without the need for direct inoculation of every animal. In this strategy, vaccination of a limited number of 'founder' animals is used for initial introduction of the vaccine into the target population. As the vaccine is engineered to express target antigens from the EID pathogen of interest, its spread from vaccinated to non-vaccinated animals will result in coordinated spread of EID-specific immunity throughout the targeted animal population.",22.351899406194022,9.214399352478749

Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility.

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare. This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available.

There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months.

Although human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been identified in many European, African, and Middle Eastern countries, [27] [28] [29] [30] a genomic analysis of the Riyadh MERS-CoV isolates suggested that there were three genetically distinct lineages of MERS-CoV; therefore, it was unlikely that the Riyadh infections were the result of a single, continuous chain of human-to-human transmission [15, 31, 32] . A recent study provided further evidence of non-sustainable transmission among humans and suggested that transmission within Saudi Arabia was dependent on contact with an animal reservoir or animal products [14] ; however, no animal reservoir has yet been identified. While contact with camels has been reported, these reports were limited to only the primary cases [22, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] .

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",26.994386806421133,12.624497877574392

Many jurisdictions have imposed traveller screening in an effort to prevent importation of COVID-19 cases to unaffected areas. Some high-income countries have escalated control measures beyond screening-based containment policies, and now restrict or quarantine inbound travellers from countries known to be experiencing substantial community transmission. Meanwhile, in many other countries, screening remains the primary barrier to case importation (Guardian reporting team, 2020; Schengen Visa Info, 2020) . Even in countries with the resources to enforce quarantine measures, expanded arrival screening may be the first logical response as the source epidemic expands to regions outside China.

Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program.

The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",36.12026450727636,12.7667515734135

The year 2020 has started with a rapid, global epidemic of the virus SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease COVID-19. The virus appears to have transmitted to humans in a zoonotic event from bats. There are many questions to investigate regarding all aspects of SARS-CoV-2 virology and epidemiology. These questions range from how the virus emerged to how it spreads and how the disease manifests. But most pressingly as the global outbreak continues to grow, can we develop effective vaccine and therapeutic strategies to treat not only this epidemic but any future coronavirus spillover events?",28.907930544953608,14.446617365061613

MERS-CoV circulates extensively in dromedary populations causing no impactful disease. Human infection, however, is associated with a measured case fatality ratio of around 35% (World Health Organisation, 2018a). Following spill-over events, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is relatively inefficient and limited to close, unprotected contact environments such as hospitals (Breban et al., 2013; Cauchemez et al., 2013) . Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences isolated from dromedaries and humans indicates that hundreds of camel-to-human spill-over events are likely to have occurred since 2012 .

When the zoonoses first occurred remains an interesting question. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also have common ancestry with viruses found in bats. Both of these viruses had an intermediate host for transmission into humans, these being palm civets and camels for SARS-and MERS-CoV, respectively (1). There has been a suggestion that pangolins may be the intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 (7), but this remains to be established. Knowing the intermediate host is an important step for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 became a human virus and how to potentially curtail further spillover events. Knowing that MERS-CoV transmits to humans via dromedary camels has allowed for the development of a camel vaccine to potentially limit spread to humans (8, 9) . Approval for novel vaccines in animal hosts is far easier than in humans. Moreover, knowing the intermediate host allows for measures to be taken to limit human contact with the animal (e.g., not selling meat from these animals in wet food markets), which can again help reduce the chances of future spillover events. However, with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 being so extensive, whether these measures would be effective at limiting human cases of COVID-19 may be unlikely.",27.913286221332797,12.669501463877763

Indeed, one of the most important observations in disease emergence is that not all viruses that jump species boundaries successfully evolve onward transmission in the new host. Rather, many such viruses appear as transient 'spill-over' infections that soon die out, even in the absence of infection control. For example, despite repeated spill-over events from birds to humans, H5N1 avian influenza virus has not been able to evolve sustained human-to-human transmission [9] . Other viruses have been more successful and resulted in significant outbreaks in new hosts. For example, Ebola virus (EBOV) has caused several localized epidemics that have been largely restricted in their spread by administrative boundaries and border closings [10] . Hence, although there is evidence of the active adaptation of EBOV to humans during the recent 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa [11, 12] , the virus clearly possesses the base-line virological traits needed to ensure its onward transmission in the new host. Finally, some viruses have evolved to become endemic human pathogens, involving the generation of well-established and longstanding chains of transmission that do not require repeated spill-over events from an animal reservoir. An obvious case in point is HIV, the agent of AIDS, although a wide variety of human viruses fall into this class. Indeed, it is likely that most endemic virus infections in humans ultimately resulted from cross-species transmission, although in the majority of cases the exact animal reservoir species are unknown or unsampled. For example, although hepaciviruses are being increasingly documented in animal populations, it is likely that the true reservoir species for human hepatitis C virus has yet to be identified [13, 14] . These different virus -host associations, from spill-over to endemicity, highlight the two central questions in the evolution of virus emergence: (i) Why are only some viruses able to successfully spread in a new host? (ii) What barriers, both ecological and genetic, prevent active host adaptation from taking place?",26.878073167690545,12.521330637893197

The concept of Information Diet was introduced by Clay Johnson for the first time. He believes consumers should take responsibility for the type of information they consume, likewise the rational consumption of food. He also argues that there must be a sustainable news movement, like a sustainable food movement that has already started in the US. In other words, people and even governments are not capable of dealing with the media to a great extent, but people can create their own information diets, like food diet. Therefore, information consumers are advised to consume information in a limited way. However, they must demand complete and credible news, not news that is based on emotional content and full of advertisements"" (4). In the present Coronavirus crisis, some people spend most of their time studying related information regarding Covid-19 in written and virtual media; Meanwhile, they are unwilling to spend time exercising at home, talking to their families, playing with their children or doing other useful tasks such as studying, watching movies and so on. To seriously address these problems in the Coronavirus crisis, not only people must have optimum consumption of appropriate information, but also consuming information should comply with specific terms and conditions. For example, children should not be exposed to the news related to the Coronavirus, because this information increases anxiety and causes other psychological problems among them. The elderly is also vulnerable to the spread of information, and should be provided with reliable and limited information, and they should not be given the ongoing news. On the other hand, individuals should be able to distinguish between high quality and poor quality information, since much of the information regarding Covid-19 is invalid and is produced and published for economic, political, social, and in general profitable purposes (disinformation). Nowadays, in-formation is being provided every day, and by contemplating on and reviewing the publication of statistics related to the Coronavirus crisis on websites, blogs, social media, television and satellite channels etc., it can be understood that the overload of information has already occurred. Hence, providing people with all kinds of health literature is the only option. Although people may not have the ability to control the production and supply of the information nowadays, each of them must control the extent and type of the information which they consume. Therefore, in order to achieve a comprehensive information diet in societies, people need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills of health information literacy, media health literacy, media literacy and health literacy. Currently these trainings can only be delivered through the mass media. Delivering these skills requires specific knowledge and skills which health information professionals (medical librarians) poses, and they can train other people in the society through mass media relying on their abilities.",21.43608310495774,8.736946341755349

The epidemic emerged suddenly after a long latent period without dramatic changes as revealed from the cumulative cases, and their first and second derivatives. The high responsiveness of the epidemic to interventions adds additional evidence supporting the chaotic and catastrophic nature, and demonstrating the selection of a good timing to start intervention. Many of these characters are similar to those observed in the 2003 SARS epidemic started in Hong Kong [2] , the 2013-16 Ebola spread in the West Africa [4, 5] , the 2009 pandemic of H1N1 started in the US [6] [7] [8] , and the measles outbreaks over 80 cities in the US recently [9] . Even the seasonal common flu has been proved to have a nonlinear component [11, 12] . The significance of nonlinear and chaotic nature of COVID-19 means that no methods are available to predict exactly at what point in time the epidemic will emerge as an outbreak, just like volcanoes and earthquakes. Therefore, practically there is no so-called a best time or missed the best time to take actions. There will also no so-called rational analysis and rational responses. There is no silver bullet to use, no standard-operating-procedure (SOP) to follow, and no measures without negative consequences to control the epidemic [2] . For example, it took more than 6 months for both the US and the WHO to determine the 2009 H1N1 pandemic as an outbreak [13, 14] . Therefore, knowing the nonlinear and chaotic nature of an epidemic outbreak, like COVID-19, for all stockholders will be essential to the mobilization of resources, working together, taking all actions possible to control the epidemic, and minimizing the negative consequences.",24.51457663444204,10.25911540213856

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test.

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",35.48470319002743,13.356906696572466

A specific reference was made to data from South Korea where 30% of the 2,000 tested patients reported symptoms or anosmia or ageusia. The article states that doctors are advising patients to self-isolate if they experience these symptoms as it could be an early indication of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. This is particularly pertinent since current governmental guidelines in the United Kingdom (UK) state that if you have either a temperature or a dry cough then to self-isolate. Should anosmia emerge as a symptom of COVID-19, this could encourage more people to self-isolate, even in absence of other symptoms, to prevent further spread of the virus. Therefore, more information surrounding this possible symptom is crucial. However, whilst it is possible that anosmia and ageusia are in fact symptoms of COVID-19, to our knowledge there is currently no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia and/or ageusia/dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, testing is not yet widespread in the UK and is mainly occurring only in patients hospitalised with the disease.

Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms.

CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] . Moreover, the pathological findings associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 showed abundant interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, dominated by lymphocytes, once again implying that the immune hyperactivation mechanisms are at least partially accountable for COVID-19 severity [17] .

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) . There is currently no definitive cure for COVID-19, and the treatment regimens prescribed for patients are the main treatments that have previously been effective in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and chloroquine phosphate is the * Corresponding Author: Ali Rismanbaf; Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Hezar Jerib Street, Isfahan, Iran.

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",29.592769593130438,12.591763384685725

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",25.48293643925201,11.609708811906616

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",28.16322818165588,9.706412526150036

Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined. Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified. Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted. Should it be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future.

To accommodate the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 (ranging from asymptomatic to severe or even fatal in some cases) 31 , the WHO recently introduced a rather unspecific name (coronavirus disease 19, also known as COVID-19 (ref. 36 )) to denote this disease. Also, the diagnostic methods used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections are not identical to those of SARS-CoV. This is reflected by the specific recommendations for public health practitioners, healthcare workers and laboratory diagnostic staff for SARS-CoV-2 (for example, the WHO guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 37 ). By uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases that some of them cause in humans and animals, we wish to support the WHO in its efforts to establish disease names in the most appropriate way (for further information, see the WHO's guidelines for disease naming 38 ). The further advancement of naming conventions is also important because the ongoing discovery of new human and animal viruses by next-generation sequencing technologies can be expected to produce an increasing number of viruses that do not (easily) fit the virus-disease model that was widely used in the pregenomic era (Box 1). Having now established different names for the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease (COVID-19) , the CSG hopes that this will raise awareness in both the general public and public health authorities regarding the difference between these two entities.

However, it has recently been questioned if such numbers reflect the real burden of severe COVID-19 disease in children [14] . Using the ratio of COVID-19 to influenza cases identified in an early retrospective surveillance study in China [3], it was estimated that the actual number of severe pediatric cases and mildly infected children may have been significantly larger (by a factor of several hundreds and several thousands, respectively) compared to what had been registered suggesting that the force of infection from children may have been grossly underestimated [14] . In regards of clinical impact, the available 4 data suggest that the proportion of severe and critical cases seems to be inversely related to age suggesting that young children, and in particular infants and pre-school children, could be more vulnerable to COVID-19 related morbidity [10] . Thus, clinicians caring for children should be wary of subgroups of children who can be at an increased risk for more significant illness, as particularly younger age, underlying pulmonary pathology, and many immunocompromising conditions have also been associated with more severe outcomes with other coronavirus infections in children [15] .",30.691689564140987,12.895080204480212

Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Recently, a study posted in medRxiv 4 has reported neurological manifestations in COVID-19 in the current outbreak that involved 214 patients, of which 78 (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations, which affirms our rationale of the neurotropic potential in the COVID-19 virus.

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",33.61198658326128,14.40814666353266

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus.

Remdesivir is being developed by Gilead as a monophosphoramidate prodrug: GS-441524. It was intended to be an intravenous treatment for Ebola but it also shows potential against coronavirus and Nipah virus infection. The results from evaluating the antiviral efficiency of remdesivir against a clinical isolate of COVID-19 in vitro suggest that it could inhibit COVID-19 strongly with an EC50 ranging from 0.77 to 1.76 μM [3] . Remdesivir cured the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the USA, which prompted Gilead and the Chinese authorities to move the Phase III trial ahead and expand it to a lot more patients who desperately need treatment. Final results of the clinical trial will be announced in April 2020. In contrast to remdesivir, the activity report of favipiravir in vitro and in vivo is limited. However, there are still three active clinical trials regarding favipiravir that have begun enrolling patients in China. Lopinavir and ritonavir, targeting 3Clpro, were used to treat SARS patients from China in 2003. Shortly after the emergence of MERS-CoV, researchers identified lopinavir and ritonavir as MERS-CoV inhibitors. The national expert group has recommended lopinavir and ritonavir as effective anti-COVID-19 agents in China, and most clinical trials on COVID-19 select both drugs as positive controls. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Currently, only one trial combines emtricitabine/tenofoviralafenamide and lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19 patients. Arbidol as a 2′-5′oligoadenylates synthesis (OAS) inhibitor against severe pneumonia and virusassociated cytokine dysregulation has displayed anti-COVID-19 potential in clinical trials [4] . However, the mechanism needs to be clarified in the near future. Chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have elicited antiviral effects on several viruses such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E by interfering with endosomal acidification. Based on the advantage of known broadspectrum activity and rarely occurring adverse reactions, a series of clinical trials on chloroquine and its derivatives have been advancing rapidly. Presently, Chinese government authorities have approved chloroquine phosphate to be used to treat adult patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Further, treatments combining Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and chemical molecules (popularly known as Western medicine in China) have shown some exciting results. In view of inconclusive clinical evidence on TCM efficacy, pharmacologists should separate active pharmaceutical ingredients and identify explicit targets as soon as possible [5] . Surprisingly, various drugs are also in clinical trials despite the lack of biological rationale, such as the antiinfluenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir targeting neuraminidase, baloxavirmarboxil targeting cap-dependent endonuclease that is not found in COVID-19, ASC09 targeting protease with no anti-coronavirus research reported, and cobicistat targeting CYP3A4 with only unpersuasive predicted activity by computer virtual docking. As the crystal structures of COVID-19 spike [6] , dimeric full-length human ACE2 [7] and COVID-19 spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ACE2 receptor [8] are published in succession, the lead drug discovery strategy such as structure-based HTS and molecular dynamics simulation to discover inhibitors with affinity to ACE2, the S protein or the protein-protein interaction will be possible in the near future. There have been three major outbreaks of coronaviruses in the 21st century: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19. Drawing experience from effective screening strategies on antitumor drug development, the credible and large-scale screening system of the especially deadly coronaviruses must be set up at the molecular level and in animal models as soon as possible. Although the clinical safety of old drugs has been proven, some of them can cause serious adverse reactions. For example, hydroxychloroquine has the side effect of arrhythmia, which can itself lead to death. Thus, special attention needs to be paid to the safety of old drugs in new indications.",29.55753794915234,12.80204094114268

In such a scenario, the role of a psychiatrist is likely to be important both in short and long-term (Banerjee, 2020) . The unprecedented situation has raised questions regarding the nature and determinants of mental health promotion at a population and an institutional level Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020) . This work was conducted with a view to find out the perceived motivations influencing morale amongst HP in a multi-specialty tertiary hospital. This work was conducted in a tertiary hospital in North India that is involved in the care of patients with COVID-19/suspected COVID-19. As per the prevailing norms issued by the Government of India, patients with suspected infection due to direct contact/foreign travel are quarantined at home or a facility specially created for this purpose. Patients with confirmed infection are mandatorily admitted to isolation wards in the hospital specially created for this purpose. Owing to the danger of infection and paucity of protective gear, direct access to patients is limited but for the frontline HP who are trained to provide medical care for the infection. One of the authors conducted interviews with HP involved in care of these patients in this hospital and at other places in North India. The following themes were identified on the basis of these interviews. These are presented below with a view to disseminate so that hospitals facing or preparing for COVID-19 can factor in these issues.",27.511575350553105,10.573589480207968

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2, which have been responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2002 to 2004 and for the more recent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, respectively, interface with the RAAS through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme that physiologically counters RAAS activation but also functions as a receptor for both SARS viruses. 1, 2 The interaction between the SARS viruses and ACE2 has been proposed as a potential factor in their infectivity, 3, 4 and there are concerns about the use of RAAS inhibitors that may alter ACE2 and whether variation in ACE2 expression may be in part responsible for disease virulence in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. [5] [6] [7] [8] Indeed, some media sources and health systems have recently called for the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), both prophylactically and in the context of suspected Covid-19. Given the common use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs in patients with Covid-19 is urgently needed. Here, we highlight that the data in humans are too limited to support or refute these hypotheses and concerns. Specifically, we discuss the uncertain effects of RAAS blockers on ACE2 levels and activity in humans, and we propose an alternative hypothesis that ACE2 may be beneficial rather than harmful in patients with lung injury. We also explicitly raise the concern that withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors may be harmful in certain high-risk patients with known or suspected Covid-19.",29.53480298964306,12.920323183902536

As these institutions may not be able to provide specialised hepatology-care, similar to our recommendations on outpatient care, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information to facilitate immediate hepatology consultations. However, due to the contagiousness of the virus, patients with underlying liver disease will become infected and will subsequently require inpatient care for COVID-19.

In order for the virus to complete entry into the cell following this initial process, the spike protein has to be primed by an enzyme called a protease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) uses a protease called TMPRSS2 to complete this process. 10, 11 In order to attach virus receptor (spike protein) to its cellular ligand (ACE2), activation by TMPRSS2 as a protease is needed (Fig. 4) . 10 After the virus enters the host cell and uncoats, the genome is transcribed and then translated. Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicate, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene. 12 The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins. Besides RNAdependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3 0 -to-5 0 exoribonuclease, 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1 0 -phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic Genotype and phenotype of COVID- 19 3 phosphodiesterase activities. 13, 14 The proteins are assembled at the cell membrane and genomic RNA is incorporated as the mature particle forms by budding from the internal cell membranes. 15",28.059518761427462,10.372983214454791

Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread rapidly around the globe, including Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. 1 The 2019 novel coronavirus is likely similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. They belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and can cause severe respiratory disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory failure. 2 Tracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation is the mainstay therapy to correct hypoxaemia. Preoxygenation with the standard bag-valve mask oxygenation followed by rapid-sequence intubation has been proposed in non-severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation to reduce the risk of aspiration and desaturation. However, a previous study reported that 23% of patients had SpO 2 <90% during intubation. 3 Thus far, more than 80000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 has been described, including in many healthcare workers. 4, 5 Rapid-sequence fibreoptic bronchoscopic tracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may reduce the risk of viral spread. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) during fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared with standard mask oxygenation (SMO). This study was approved by the ethics committee of the General Hospital of Central Theatre Command and registered at http://www.chictr.org/cn/ (registration number: ChiCTR2000029658).

In this context, the promising findings of several studies have highlighted the growing role of chest computed tomography (CT) scan for identifying the typical findings of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The common typical chest CT scan findings were summarized in Table. Among the published chest CT findings related to the COVID-19 infection, the most common imaging finding was pure ground-glass opacities with the occurrence rate of up to 74% (603 out of 807 patients). More than 62% of patients (224 out of 359) had mixed pattern opacities in their CT, which was a combination of consolidation, ground glass opacities, and reticular opacities.

Generally, the curves tended to be not associated with COVID-19 mortality for DTR but were strongly positive for temperature. In addition, the curves associated with relative humidity and absolute humidity presented similar linear trends, which indicated that the higher level of humidity might cause decrease in the COVID-19 mortality. To confirm these results, lag and cumulative effects were discussed in the following analysis. Researchers confirmed that respiratory infection was enhanced during unusually cold and low humidity conditions (Davis et al., 2016) , indicating low humidity might also be an important risk factor for respiratory diseases. A 25-year study found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality, and low-humidity levels might cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms (Barreca, 2012) , similar to a study carried out in the United States (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012) . Consistent to these findings, our results also indicate that the risk of dying from COVID-19 decreases only with absolute humidity increasing. Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread (Lowen et al., 2007) . Moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is efficient under cold, dry conditions (Steel et al., 2011) , and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity (Shaman et al., 2009 ), which may be very similar to coronavirus. Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ",27.090411734818662,9.371635164105628

Nurses from other departments were required to go through three training stages before starting nursing duties for patients with COVID-19: pre-job training, adaptive training by nursing other patients in the infection department, and negative pressure ward training. This process occupied about one week. Nurses who entered the negative pressure ward would work for 0.5 -3 months before being transferred to other non-anti-epidemic positions. Because COVID-19 is a new disease and the medical system and culture of different countries varies, further research is needed on the psychological experience of frontline nurses fighting against COVID-19. Currently, published studies have highlighted the disease prevalence [17] , clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment [2] . Some reports have paid attention to the severity of psychological problems in medical personnel [18] and the urgency of providing psychological care [19] .

Early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quarantine and isolation strategies of patients with COVID-19 can significantly prevent and control the transmission of the virus. By appropriately identifying the infected individuals and minimizing the transmission of the virus in the community, it is possible to effectively control the spread of infection. The early clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lack specificity, and its etiology is difficult to identify through computed tomography scans. Therefore, the handbook guide [1] suggests that the gold standard of diagnosing COVID-19 is real-time fluorescence-based real-time isolation rooms and install air purification systems. Therefore, our hospital designed and set up a special room under negative pressure for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with an air change rate of 12 times per hour. To prevent close contact between suspected cases and the sampling collector, a transparent acrylic board with two openings for sampling was set up to separate the two areas for them ( Figure 1 ). The room was installed with air disinfectors and ultraviolet air purifiers.",26.25318984066726,10.268922604683523

As a result, several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in China and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus. Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxxx (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferon beta is also being trialled in COVID-19 based on its antiviral properties (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276688). Then there is the virology to take into account. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species (Andersen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. As it is a small RNA virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution. Vaccines take time to be developed, tested and introduced at a population level. Delaying treatment, de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory DMTs, such as interferonbeta, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, or interrupting dosing of DMTs to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of MS, especially as it may take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine. We, therefore, need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of COVID-19 in individuals with MS. If patients have active MS they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy DMTs. This should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virus.",30.124504512965686,12.439479392018916

It was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China and the disease was officially named CoViD-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11th , 2020 following an outbreak of acute respiratory illness in the Hubei province. Since these earliest reports, this infection has spread in many countries worldwide with a significant rate of infection in Italy that currently accounts for more than 110,000 infected cases associated with 13,155 fatalities. The WHO declared CoViD-19 a pandemic on March 11th. The CoViD-19 pandemic has important implications for patients with rheumatic diseases, particularly those undergoing a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. As it seems obvious that immunosuppressive therapy increases their risk of severe disease if infected with CoViD-19, many patients have the tendency to stop their immunosuppressive treatments, especially in highly impacted areas such as the Italian Lombardy region. However, it is important to note that many commonly used immunosuppressive drugs such as JAK kinase inhibitors and tocilizumab have been proposed and/or used for the treatment of select patients who develop a frequently fatal clinical sequalae known as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) (also referred to as ""cytokine storm"") following CoViD-19 infection.

SARS-CoV2 is a positive single strand 30,000 nucleotide RNA virus that includes 14 open reading frames that encode 27 proteins and belongs to the Coronaviridae family. Its phylogenetic data are consistent with the presence of a bat reservoir and subsequent spill over into the human population. Sequencing data shows that SARS-CoV2 shares a high degree of sequence homology with a betacoronavirus isolated from bats termed Bat-CoV-RaTG13, suggesting that the Chinese chrysanthemum bat is the likely origin of SARS-CoV2. Nonetheless, an unknown animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan has been hypothesized to act as the intermediate host, as the first cases had common contacts in a market where no bats were present (bats hibernate in December). In addition, SARS-CoV2 shares 79% and 50% gene homologies with the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that was responsible for an outbreak in 2002 and with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV responsible for infections in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively. Both these viruses had intermediate hosts that included the civet and camel, respectively, with humans serving as terminal hosts [1] .""""

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases. [7] [8] [9] More recent descriptions of patients in China also noted around 10% of patients were also noted to have elevated total bilirubin levels. 8 Gastroenterologists should be aware of these potential gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.",29.67378755161195,13.821250042440099

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

The rapid transmission across country borders and the large number of confirmed cases prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of March 23, there are at least 332 930 and 14 510 patients who have been diagnosed with and have died of COVID-19 worldwide, respectively. Among the affected countries, China has the largest population of confirmed cases (81 610) and the second highest death toll (3276). Meanwhile, Europe and North America have also been hit hard: 59 138 and 31 573 cases were confirmed in Italy and the United States, which are the nations with the highest number of 2019-nCoV infected patients in their respective continents, with the number of deaths in Italy (5476) surpassing that of China. Understanding the viral infection mechanisms and animal hosts is of high urgency for the control and treatment of the 2019-nCoV virus. Whereas it is now commonly recognized that bats such as Rhinolophus aff inis may serve as the natural reservoir of 2019-nCoV, 3 it is still unclear which animal served as the intermediate host that brought the bat coronavirus to human hosts. Whereas multiple studies suggest the Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) as another host, 4−6 some studies have proposed that the pangolin may be a natural host rather than an intermediate host. 7, 8 During 2019-nCoV's infection of host cells, a critical virion component is the spike surface glycoprotein, also known as the S protein. Spike proteins constitute the outermost component in a coronavirus virion particle and are responsible for the recognition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a transmembrane receptor on mammalian hosts that is utilized by the coronavirus to enter the host cells. 3, 9 Therefore, the spike protein largely determines the host specificity and infectivity of a coronavirus.",30.081196449096453,11.484860589517561

COVID-19 spread quickly across Hubei Province and other regions of China, 1 , 2 also the global alert for COVID-19 has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 , 2 COVID-19 could induce symptoms including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue and lymphopenia in patients, and might result in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and even death in severe cases. [1] [2] [3] SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree and shares ∼80% identity sequencing with the Bat SARS-like coronavirus and the original SARS epidemic virus. 4 , 5 Currently, it remains to be determined the origins and possible intermediate animal vectors of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the mechanism that this virus spread among humans. Despite many reports have characterized the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological features, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the information of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation remains not reported. The curative and eradicative therapy for COVID-19 is not currently available. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether patients with COVID-19 pneumonia will reactivate, and whether risk factors predict SARS-CoV-2 reactivation in patients. To prevent and control COVID-19 reactivation, we retrospectively collected and analyzed detailed clinical data from SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients. In the study, we presented clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients and discussed the potential risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.",35.78900383762041,16.405255838215666

The economic fall-out from COVID-19 appears to be profound, at least $20 trillion in a few short weeks, and may exceed the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The direct costs of COVID-19 travel bans, social distancing, and other responses are merely one aspect. Far more devastating is the uncertainty that has gripped capital markets. Declining economic activity and large drops in capital markets have a mutually reinforcing impact, undermining the capacity of heavily indebted businesses and households to cover their debts. Uncertainty is the primary driver of such crises, and stems in large measure from lack of close coordination and science-based decision-making. Were there more certainty, households, investors and other economic agents would be less inclined to panic. COVID-19 appears certain to become a very costly lesson that DRR does indeed save many more multiples in avoided costs than its initial investment. An additional point in this regard is that health is a critical infrastructure. The resilience of critical infrastructure is well identified in DRR literature (e.g. [18, 19] ). Resilience is fostered not just by sciencebased decisions and coordination, but also via redundancy to ensure buffer capacity when a particular system collapses [20] . Disaster-illiterate economic policy tends to see redundancy as inefficiency. But in order to cope with COVID-19 and alleviate -if not prevent -future emergencies, supply chains for at least some critical items need to be more local. In tandem, governments and private businesses will have to broaden their crisis planning to ensure timely availability of items essential to limiting pandemic risks.",29.263619065390156,12.130216318405811

[5] [6] [7] It has rapidly spread globally. As of February 18, 72,532 cases were laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed, and 6242 were suspected in China. 8 The reproductive number (R0), defined as the expected number of secondary infectious cases generated by an infectious case in a susceptible population, is estimated to 3.77. 9 Recent publications have depicted the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. 2 , 3 , 7 , 9-11 The definite diagnosis of COVID-19 is expected with the novel coronavirus nucleic acid positive in swabs, sputum, or secretions from the lower respiratory tract, or blood by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). However, the new coronavirus nucleic acid kits are in short supply and time-consuming in manipulation. Furthermore, false negatives may exist in some cases due to the insufficient viral materials in the specimen. Recent studies have reported the cases with initial SARS-CoV-2 negative but typical CT findings, 12 , 13 however, most of them turned out to be positive after repeated tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid.

Efforts have been made to search for a reservoir host or intermediate carriers from which the infection may have spread to humans. Initial reports identified two species of snakes that could be a possible reservoir of the COVID-19. However, to date, there has been no consistent evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds [10, 18] . Genomic sequence analysis of COVID-19 showed 88% identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [19, 20] , indicating that mammals are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans. Several reports have suggested that person-to-person transmission is a likely route for spreading COVID-19 infection. This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan [13, 21] . Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth. This is important because pregnant mothers are relatively more susceptible to infection by respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia (https://www.thelancet.com, DOI:https://doi.org/10. 1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3).",39.94146138490921,17.78303454837789

Based on the genetic sequence identity and the phylogenetic reports, COVID-19 is sufficiently different from SARS-CoV and it can thus be considered as a new betacoronavirus that infects humans. The COVID-19 most likely developed from bat origin coronaviruses. Another piece of evidence that supports the COVID-19 is of bat origin is the existence of a high degree of homology of the ACE2 receptor from a diversity of animal species, thus implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for COVID-19 infections [20] . Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame on gene 8, which is a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.

Evidence to date has suggested rapid spread of the virus: at the time of writing, imported cases have been reported in 143 countries and territories, including Singapore. 243 confirmed cases have been reported in Singapore; however, this number is expected to increase substantially in the following weeks. In 2003, SARS-CoV, which also originated from mainland China, established locally, causing 33 deaths after 238 cases were confirmed. Therefore, there is considerable concern since 3204 deaths and 81 048 cases of COVID-19 have already been confirmed in mainland China, which surpasses the numbers observed in the SARS-CoV outbreak. 2020 Lunar New Year celebrations have now ended, marking a period of extensive travel between China and Singapore, and a corresponding high risk for case importation. Despite heightened surveillance and isolation of individuals suspected to have COVID-19 and confirmed cases, the risk is ongoing, with the number of cases continuing to increase in Singapore.

Methods: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study.

For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]).

We would like to congratulate the authors for their development and rigorous account of the endoscopic practices they have successfully used to minimize infection of endoscopy staff while providing essential services in this high-risk environment. We would also like to share a U.S. hospital perspective gained from our experience contending with numerous COVID-19 cases following the Biogen conference in Boston, Massachusetts.

In many regions this increased morbidity and mortality is particularly seen in older persons and those presenting with co-morbidities such as overt diabetes, obesity and hypertension [1] [2] [3] [4] . The high incidence of diabetes throughout the world makes this particularly concerning as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses. To this point emerging data particularly from China, indicates that patients with diabetes are at high risk for COVID-19 infection. For example, a large observational report 2 including 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection indicated that in 173 with severe disease there existed the comorbidities of hypertension (23·7%), diabetes mellitus (16·2%), coronary heart diseases (5·8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2·3%).

The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to numerous countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study reveals that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We find a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship is confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence reveals that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirm the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear.

This hypothesis has led some European countries to produce initial policies relying on decreased transmission rates during the summer months, 3 and the belief that African countries will face smaller epidemics than their European counterparts. However, no strong evidence base exists for such claims; SARS-CoV-2 might have simply arrived later to warmer countries. We used data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Baltimore, MD, USA) to plot the cumulative number of cases since the diagnosis of both the first patient and the first five patients by country, both in Europe and Africa (figure). Although the first confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred later in west Africa than in Europe, once these first cases were confirmed in west Africa, the expansion in the number of confirmed COVID-19 was rapid. Of particular concern are Burkina Faso and Senegal, which saw sharp increases in the number of cases soon after the initial cases were confirmed in these countries. Cases in both countries might evolve in a similar way to what was observed in European countries with the most expansive epidemics (ie, Italy and Spain, where SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly after case number five was detected).

It also assumes a small proportion of persons who are negative or have recovered from COVID-19; this may change with the availability of wider testing and the ability to test for past infection or immunity. Recent data from China, by Chang et al, revealed the greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to health care workers during early stages of the pandemic when testing was not yet widely available. 61 In a JAMA report published from Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, 29.3% (40 of 138) of COVID-19 infected patients were health care workers who presumably had hospital-acquired infections. 27 Among 493 health care workers caring for hospitalized patients, 10/493 health care workers became infected with COVID-19; all 10 were unprotected health care workers (no mask) caring for patients on medical wards with a low risk of exposure (no known or suspected COVID-19 patients). In contrast, none of the 278 protected health care workers (N95 mask) caring for high risk patients (known or suspected COVID-19) became infected (aOR 464.82; 95% CI: 97.73 to infinite). 62 One study, evaluating health care worker exposure in the care of one COVID-19 positive patient, revealed that none of 41 health care workers (surgical masks only) developed infection despite absence of N95 mask, although studies evaluating health care workers in context of larger cohorts of COVID-19 positive patients are not yet available. 63 The decision to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures is based on evidence of possible aerosolization during colonoscopy especially during the insertion and removal of instruments through the biopsy channel. 53 and the uncertain risks associated with evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples. These data provided indirect evidence to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures pending more definitive evidence. 33 Limited resource settings Recommendation 4: In extreme resource-constrained settings involving health care workers performing any GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status, the AGA suggests extended use/re-use of N95 masks over surgical masks, as part of appropriate personal protective equipment.

[68] [69] [70] Therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for COVID-19 include molecules binding to the virus, molecules, or inhibitors that target specific enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription, small-molecule inhibitors targeting helicase, essential proteases, or other proteins of the virus, host cell protease inhibitors, host cell endocytosis inhibitors, siRNA, anti-sense RNA and ribozyme, neutralizing antibodies, mAbs targeting host receptor or interfere with S1 RBD, antiviral peptide targeting S2, and natural products. 2, 11 There is a long list of anti-CoV agents, mostly preclinical compounds yet to be evaluated as anti-COVID-19 agents. Some of these agents are in phase III trials for COVID-19, including remdesivir, oseltamivir, ASC09F (HIV protease inhibitor), lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and cobicistat. 71 Many existing MERS-and/or SARS-CoVs inhibitors can be screened for efficacy. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has shown 96% identity to that of SARS-CoV, a critical finding since drugs developed for SARS-CoV RdRp might show similar efficacy for SARS-CoV -2 RdRp. 28 S protein is considered the major target for designing CoV antiviral therapies such as S protein inhibitors, S cleavage inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, RBD-ACE2 blockers, siRNAs, fusion core blockers, and protease inhibitors. 19 All such therapeutic strategies have shown potential in vitro and/ or in vivo anti-CoV activities. Comparatively, even though in vitro studies performed with these agents have shown efficacy, most of them lack sufficient support due to the lack of randomized animal or human trials, hence of limited use for COVID-19. Hence, the necessary support of extensive animal and human trials is required for such therapeutics to become useful. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 affects the balance of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), potentially leading to exacerbation of severe pneumonia. Thus, it is speculated that ACEI and angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) inhibitors might be able to reduce pulmonary inflammatory responses, thereby reducing the mortality. 72 The guidance to COVID-19 control might be based on existing measures for MERS and SARS, with some further precautions due to the unknown nature of this new CoV. 14, 73 The main treatments such as mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe cases. Furthermore, RNA synthesis inhibitors (like 3TC, TDF), remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, Chinese traditional medicine, such as Lianhuaqingwen and ShuFengJieDu Capsules, could be the promising COVID-19 treatments. 2 However, further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for COVID-19. A major limiting factor in the quest for identifying an ideal vaccine or therapeutic agent is time. It may take months to even several years for researchers to develop, produce, standardize, evaluate, approve, and commercialize therapeutic agents for COVID-19. Hence, current efforts should be directed toward identifying and evaluating drugs and immunotherapeutics that have proven efficacy against viruses similar to COVID-19.",29.30601000106025,11.874008262758363

However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14] . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides [15] . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients [16] . 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes [17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 [18, 19] . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence [20] . Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.",27.309417358437905,10.926147538413508

However, there is probably an important number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus the mortality rate is probably overestimated. France is now facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 4500 cases, as of March 14 th 2020 [5] . Thus, there is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage in order to limit the transmission in the community.

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",31.49652993360207,13.807341067867139

With the epidemic gradually growing, it is now clear that human-to-human transmission has been prevalent 3 Importantly, when assessing COVID-19, it is noteworthy that influenza viruses share common etiologies and occur in the same season. Recently, global influenza associated with respiratory mortality is occurring at a higher frequency than what has been previously reported 5 . From September 2019 through the present day, there have been more than 170,000 patients with influenza in the United States, more than half of whom have been infected with the influenza A (H1N1) virus. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia induced by influenza is 6.8% 6 . During the H1N1 global epidemic in 2009, Jain et al. found that 5% of patients with H1N1 influenza were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and 7% died 7 .",27.336330786603014,13.204081308186115

The primary site of pharmacological action is the lung, as 16 herbs to lung meridian, which indicated that the decoction is mainly specific for lung diseases. In addition, it can play the role of dehumidification through the rise and fall of the spleen and stomach, and exhibited the protection for heart, kidney and other organs. Among the potential targets screen, most of them co-expressed with ACE-2, the receptor of COVID-19, indicating the potential improvement of COVID-19. It can inhibit the replication of COVID-19 by acting on multiple ribosomal proteins. COVID-19 can lead to strong immune response and inflammatory storm [4] . Functional enrichment analysis showed that QPD could inhibit and alleviate excessive immune response and eliminate inflammation by regulating immune related pathway and cytokine action related pathway [5] .

While the epidemiology of COVID-19 still unravels and much remains to be learnt, what already appears to be unusual in the case of this and other coronaviruses, is the population at risk. While the most vulnerable population to suffer severe outcomes of respiratory viruses other than coronaviruses are typically older adults, people suffering from chronic medical conditions, and children, in the case of COVID-19 there have so far been no fatalities in children aged 0-9 years of age in China.

This is of relevance in the face of the ever growing medical and societal urgency surrounding COVID-19, especially given the current scarcity of experimental data regarding any corresponding immune response. The approach we followed is based on establishing several lines of evidence that clearly pinpoint SARS-CoV as a relevant model to extrapolate likely targets of responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus associated with COVID-19. The first line of evidence pertains to the fact that of coronaviruses known to infect humans, SARS-CoV is the most similar in phylogenetic terms to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, targeting host lipids is being studied as an antiviral strategy and could have various applications [2] . COVID-19 seems to need to bind to the ACE-2 receptor on the membrane host cell to enable it to infect host cell upon coupled with a reliance of serine protease TMPRSS2. This intracellular protein seems to be a determinant of the virus ability to infect cell [3] .",33.30972528679224,16.58650084811517

Structural analysis shows that COVID-19 probably derives from a bat SARS-like coronavirus, which has mutated in the spike glycoprotein (protein S) and nucleocapsid N protein The positive-sense RNA genomes of COVID-19 is differ from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV approximately 29.9 kb, 27.9 kb and 30.1 kb, respectively [6] . The COVID-19 complete genome was annotated to possess 14 open reading frames ORFs encode 27 proteins. Sequence analysis revealed that COVID-19 is identity 80% more than to SARS-CoV and 50% to the MERS-CoV which originated in bat [7, 8] . In addition to that, spherical external spike protein displays a characteristic crown shape can be observed under an electron microscope [9] . Current study, we have compared between novel COVID-19 complete genome with other related corona virus to provoke the mutation and the gaps. We selected the data from NCBI and we did the FASTA and BLAST. The comparison between genomes with alignment has done using MAAFT-7 software. COVID-19 gene bank (MT188341.1), COVID-19 (MT066175.1), bat-SL-CoVZC45 (MG772933.1), SARS-CoV BJ182b (EU371561.1) are identical alignment in 99%, 89%, and 82% respectively. In figure (1) shows the differences between 4 complete genomes shows as follow: Upon to the result above, we revealed that all COVID-19 strains are closest similarity compared to other strains related to the same family. In other words, we believe that COVID-19 came from several mutations happened to other members of coronavirus relates to the same infection. Although genomic analysis does not support the belief that COVID-19 is a laboratory construct, currently it is impossible to disprove or prove the theories of its origin. To identify the COVID-19 origin, obtaining virus sequences from immediate animal sources would be the most definite method. The first ORF (ORF1a/b) translates two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP) which takes two-thirds of viral RNA. The remaining ORFs encode structural proteins including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. COVID-19 also possesses accessory proteins that interfere with the host innate immune response [8] .",35.196731482577576,15.088352155805914

To limit the virus spread, those in the USA are canceling both smaller (∼100 people) and large meetings, researchers are limiting their travel both overseas and within the country, and student college and graduate school visit weekends are being postponed or stopped altogether. Still, there is much uncertainty about how to proceed and what other measures should be taken. Since the outbreak began in China, Chinese scientists have already faced many of the questions that those of us in other locations are now asking. We therefore asked several Chinese scientists to discuss the strategies that they are pursuing to limit the impact of the virus both on their research and on society. Some of the actions taken by the scientists and the government under this extreme situation may have a long-term influence and shift our future research and funding paradigm. We anticipate that their perspectives will be valuable to the community. global lifethreatening concern in recent days.

We wanted to provide a glimpse of what chemical biologists have been working on, from the perspective of scientists in China. In the past 40 days, we have heard more stories of hope and resilience than of worry and grief in China, where 1.4 billion people are doing their best to bring this serious outbreak under control. Right now, the epidemic situation outside Hubei is gradually improving, and the situation inside Hubei has shown signs of stabilization. It is noteworthy that although it is mandated that most people have to stay at home as a quarantine procedure, scientists in China have been increasingly devoted to combating COVID-19, with several clinical trials currently underway. As for scientists throughout the world, researchers in China are making extraordinary efforts toward rapid advancement of diagnostic and treatment approaches, and are doing so under highly challenging personal circumstances with extensive restrictions on not only travel, but day-to-day activities. As mentioned by WHO officers, Chinese scientists have been extremely professional in the face of this epidemic and have made their findings rapidly available to researchers around the world to coordinate global efforts to characterize, treat, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. One team led by Yongzhen Zhang from Fudan University completed the deep sequencing of COVID-19 and made its whole genome sequence publicly available on January 10, 2020. 1 Medical experts, virologists, structural biologists, and medicinal chemists have made significant contributions in areas such as epidemic prevention and control, patient treatment, virus classification and traceability, structure analysis, and clinical drug development. The current progress relied on the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the dedication of scientific researchers. During the epidemic, almost all industries not related to any antiepidemic efforts were halted due to the lock down of transportation and lack of manpower. It has been extremely difficult to complete highlevel scientific research under such an extreme situation.",26.361750511553513,11.601317451277692

Approximately 2-10% of patients with COVID-19 present with diarrhoea, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool and blood samples. 11 This evidence implicates the possibility of viral exposure in the liver. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the target cell, 7 where the virus replicates and subsequently infects other cells in the upper respiratory tract and lung tissue; patients then begin to have clinical symptoms and manifestations. Pathological studies in patients with SARS confirmed the presence of the virus in liver tissue, although the viral titre was relatively low because viral inclusions were not observed. 3 In patients with MERS, viral particles were not detectable in liver tissue. 4 Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), a diagnostic biomarker for cholangiocyte injury, has not been reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies; we found that it was elevated in 30 (54%) of 56 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalisation in our centre (unpublished). We also found that elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were observed in one (1·8%) of 56 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalisation. A preliminary study (albeit not peer-reviewed) suggested that ACE2 receptor expression is enriched in cholangiocytes, 12 indicating that SARS-CoV-2 might directly bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function. Nevertheless, pathological analysis of liver tissue from a patient who died from COVID-19 showed that viral inclusions were not observed in the liver. 13 It is also possible that the liver impairment is due to drug hepatotoxicity, which might explain the large variation observed across the different cohorts. In addition, immune-mediated inflammation, such as cytokine storm and pneumonia-associated hypoxia, might also contribute to liver injury or even develop into liver failure in patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.",27.565294932486683,13.769163734621529

The COVID-19 epidemic is unique because of its scale, the speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of media coverage. 1 It impelled the hospitals taking charge of the cases to face the many new challenges associated with the outbreak. 2 However, the resilience of health systems in response to COVID-19 is under question, including in high-income countries. 3, 4 Health system resilience can be defined as the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons learned during the crisis, reorganise if conditions require it. 5 Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital is a 1000-bed University hospital in Paris belonging to the Assistance Publique -Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), the largest hospital system in Europe employing more than 90,000 people in 39 hospitals.

For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other authorities have recommended the adoption of adequate prevention and control measures for HCWs. WHO has recommended that HCWs should use proper personal protective equipment (PPE), such as medical masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection [3] . In some cases, such as in aerosol-generating procedures, WHO has recommended the use of FFP2 respirator masks [3] . Strict compliance with these recommended measures and with good practice procedures for managing infectious diseases may minimize the risk of virus transmission from patients to HCWs.

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, as well as other public health events, can cause emotional distress and anxiety. These feelings of distress and anxiety can occur even in people not at high risk of getting sick, in the face of a virus with which the common people may be unfamiliar. I read publications on ""Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control"" and on ""Traumatization in medical staff helping with COVID-19 control"" with a great interest (Li et al., 2020; Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020) . Li et al. reported how much people and medical staff suffer from vicarious traumatization and how this vicarious traumatization of non-front-line medical staff is more serious than that of front-line medical staff (Li et al., 2020) . As in South and Southeast Asia countries, also in Italy, there are similar problems in medical staff due to high workload and intermittent lack of protective devices. In addition, some slight form of racism is demonstrated against health care professionals who potentially have a higher risk of being infected and between non-front-line medical staff towards front-line medical staff. We don't have to forget the many doctors and nurses were infected and many of them died due to COVID-19 infection. Also in Italy, local people also have high levels of stress due to no firm estimate of how long pandemic will last and how long our lives will be disrupted or whether or not we or our loved ones will be infected. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide spectrum of psychological impact that outbreaks can inflict on people (Lima et al., 2020) . New psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness can occur or aggravate the condition of those with pre-existing mental illness and cause distress to the caregivers of affected individuals (Kelvin and Rubino, 2020) . Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals very often do not receive any training for providing mental health care (Lima et al., 2020) . Barbisch et al. (2015) described how the confinement ""caused a sense of collective hysteria, leading the staff to desperate measures"". Suicidal cases were reported in India (Goyal et al., 2020) but also in other countries, Italy included, where two infected Italian nurses committed suicide in a period of a few days probably due to fear of spreading COVID-19 to patients. It is possible that fear and anxiety of falling sick or dying, helplessness will drive an increase in the 2020 suicide rates.

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",27.842287138590468,10.189498513734577

In addition, we must better understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. This study demonstrated that, during the COVID-19 epidemic, only 7.40% of the medical staff of the psychiatric hospitals studied had experience of caring for suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19. In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, doctors from departments of infectious diseases, intensive care medicine, and respiratory medicine devoted themselves to the fight against the epidemic. Psychiatrists provided support mainly through the psychological intervention hotline during this period Duan and Zhu, 2020) since psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses lacked the clinical experience and skills to combat the epidemic.",27.726692892020232,9.472163773493817

In our study 13 strains (32.5%) demonstrated triple resistance (penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin). No isolate was found to be resistant to ceftriaxone, cefixime or spectinomycin. Conclusions: Penicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin can no longer be recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea in our area; ceftriaxone, cefixime and spectinomycin should be considered the antimicrobial of choice. Since 32.5% of tested gonococcal isolates were resistant to three antibiotics, the monitoring of the resistance to antimicrobial agents in N. gonorrhoeae must be established in Romania on a permanent basis in order to adjust standardized treatment regimens. Introduction: Syphilis incidence has increased dramatically in Amsterdam from 5/100.000 in 1998 to 32/100.000 cases in 2003. This may be due to increased unsafe sexual behaviour of homosexual men resulting from a diminished perceived threat of HIV/AIDS. The TP surface proteins encoded by repeat genes (Tpr) A to L are polymorphic and involved in partial host immunity. Objective: To develop a typing technique for TP to track syphilis transmission. Methods: From 2002 to 2004 we studied 199 cases of primary syphilis (96% men). Swabs of genital lesions were used for TP PCR diagnostics. Positive isolates were thereafter used for sequencing analysis of the TprK gene spanning the variable domains V3-V5. Phylogenetic trees of amino acid sequences allowed cluster analysis. Structured questionnaires were used in the Amsterdam STI clinic to collect socio-epidemiological information, and routine contact tracing was performed. Results: Four patients had two anatomical locations TP-PCR positive on one visit, and 2 patients visited the clinic twice (recidivists) during the study period, resulting in 205 nucleic acid isolates. In 161 (79%) a single TprK sequence type was obtained. In the other isolates either TprK PCR was negative or sequencing implied the presence of at least two TprK types. The isolates of 3 patients with dual positive lesions revealed identical sequences, however in one other patient two different TprK types were found. The isolates of both recidivists also showed two different TprK genes. Despite the fact that none of the TPpatients were known sexual partners, we identified 19 clusters of identical isolates. Cluster size varied from 2 to 4 patients. These clusters may reveal links which remained unknown by classical contact tracing. Conclusion: Typing the V3 to V5 domains of the TprK gene shows potential to identify transmission routes for syphilis. The aim of the study was to retrospectively review the epidemiological and clinical features of mammal-associated injuries in travellers reported to the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network. Characteristics examined included type of animal, countries of exposure, provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and the occurrence of other related infections. From May 1997 to May 2005, there were 594 animal-associated injuries reported to GeoSentinel. There was a female predominance amongst injured travellers (M/F ratio 0.84) and the average age was 32 years. The predominant regions from where animal-associated injuries had been reported included Asia (75.1%), Latin America (8.2%) and Africa (6.1%). The animal species associated with injuries were known in 300 cases. Dogs were involved in 61.7% of cases, monkeys in 28%, cats in 8.7%, humans in 1% and bats and mice in 0.6% with no predominance of a particular species in the different geographical regions. Rabies PEP was given in 65% of the cases, however information for the remaining 35% was missing. There were no reports of either rabies or tularaemia in any traveller. Cat scratch disease was reported as a complicating infection in 1.2% of all reports. Animal-associated injuries accounted for 1.4% of the total reported health problems in travellers seen after travel and 1.6% in patients seen during travel. The proportionate morbidity for sustaining an animal bite was higher amongst travellers visiting Asia (2.1%) compared to Africa (0.9%), Latin America (0.6%), Australia-New Zealand (0.9%), North America (1.2%) and West Europe (1.3%) (p = 0.00001). Victims of animal injuries were younger than the other ill travellers (32 vs. 35 years old, p < 0.0001) and more frequently females (p < 0.04). Finally, the proportionate morbidity for sustaining an animal bite was higher (2.2%) in children less than 15 years (p = 0.001). This data shows that animal-associated injuries are not uncommon complaints among travellers presenting to GeoSentinel sites. The highest proportion is recorded in travellers to Asia, mostly in regions which are endemic for rabies, and this led to a requirement for PEP. Pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis must be considered for travel to regions of the world where appropriate PEP is not available. In addition, the pre-travel consultation should also include advice regarding animal-associated injuries, risk of rabies and other associated infection and PEP when travelling to high-risk regions.",12.288281720213076,8.062003638810111

CE is widely most part of the world and it is also important for human health, animal health and economy. The aim of this study was to investigate the protoscolicidal activities of Levamisole (LVM), Praziquantel (PZ) and Metronidazole (MZ) interactions of E. granulosus protoscolices during in vitro incubation. Methods: E. granulosus protoscolices were aseptically removed from liver hydatid cysts obtained from animals slaughtered at the private abattoir in Samsun, Turkey. Viable protoscolices were cultured in medium 199 during three days. The three drugs were added in combination or separately to the medium for comparison of the results. We used the following final concentrations of the drugs: LVM at alone 1000 and 2000 lg/ ml, PZ at alone 10 and 100 lg/ml, LVM at 1000 lg/ml + PZ at 10 lg/ml, MZ at alone 100, 50 and 20 lg/ml respectively. Their protoscolicidal activities were assessed after 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes post-incubation. Results: A significant protoscolicidal effect was obtained with LVM + PZ combinations after 120 minutes on protoscolices. The minimal protoscolicidal effect was found for all MZ concentrations. Conclusion: Our results showed that LVM + PZ combinations significantly deadly for protoscolices, and that further studies with regard to use of LVM + PZ combination in animal models of E. granulosus may be of help for designing new treatment regimens for CE in humans.",11.722867382723917,5.88459442119359

Lehours, A. Menard, J. Sarlangue, C. Laguente, C.H. Bebear, F. Megraud, B. De Barbeyrac (Bordeaux, FR) Objective: Whooping cough affects now young adults and teenagers, thus being able to contaminate infants unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. In this population, it evolves readily into atypical or severe forms difficult to diagnose and a biological confirmation is necessary. Thus molecular techniques represent invaluable tools. Here, we describe a real-time PCR assay for the identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in clinical specimens Methods: The available IS481 sequences of B. pertussis were aligned to identify conserved regions for the primer design. Primers for the detection of B. parapertussis were designed on the IS1001 sequence. A universal PCR targeting the 16S rDNA gene was also developed to be used as a control for extraction and for absence of PCR inhibitors. The PCR primers sets were tested on DNA extracted from the Bordetella species, and from diverse bacterial species commonly found in humans. The SYBR GreenÒ real-time PCR amplification and melting curve (Tm) analysis were carried out in an ABI PRISMÒ 7000 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems), and followed by a melting program. A retrospective study was performed on positive (n = 19) and negative (n = 13) nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). We tested prospectively 131 NPA received between April 2004 and November 2005. Results: When using the control strains, only DNA extracted from B. pertussis and B. parapertussis led to amplification, demonstrating the specificity of these two PCRs. Melting curve analysis of the amplicons from B. pertussis and B. parapertussis control strains exhibited Tm of approximately 79°C and 86°C, respectively. Serial dilutions of the extracted DNA from bacterial suspensions were tested using this assay and the regression curve was linear from 105 to 1 bacterial genome with slopes closed to that of the maximum efficiency. For the retrospective analysis, the 19 positive samples were all positive for B. pertussis, and no peak appeared for the 13 negative samples. Prospectively, this assay allowed the detection of 21 positive clinical samples (18 B. pertussis, 3 B. parapertussis), among these 14 could not have been isolated by culture. Conclusion: We have developed a new real-time PCR for the identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis targeting the IS sequences. This method, which uses the SYBR green chemistry and analysis of the melting point, is rapid, sensitive and specific, and can be easily implemented in a setting where a real time PCR apparatus is available.",4.631032438023553,4.698468400866075

Cells invasion fulfilling the Duke criteria (IgG class anti-phase I titre > 800) was detected. Most patients were treated with doxycycline and recovered. Only two patients who were significantly older and more immunocompromised than the others died eventually. Conclusion: Q fever was rarely notifiable disease in Northern Greece. Our data indicate, however, that Q fever should be considered a public health problem with several clinical manifestations. Gram-negative commensal gut bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacteroides sp. are suspected to contribute profoundly to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It has been recently shown that both bacterial groups accumulate at very high levels in the inflamed ileum and trigger severe Th1-type immunopathology of acute pan-ileitis in susceptible mice infected perorally with 100 cysts of Toxoplasma gondii. Thus, this model is excellently suited for the study of host-bacterial-relationships in small intestinal inflammation. To unravel the mechanisms by which bacteria aggravate ileal inflammation, we investigated the severity of small intestinal inflammation in mice lacking Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4, which constitute important components of the bacteria-related innate immune system. Escherichia coli and Bacteroides sp. accumulated to comparable levels during ileitis and their concentrations did not differ significantly in inflamed ilea of wild type mice and of mice lacking TLR2 or TLR4. However, the severity of ileitis was clearly diminished in mice lacking TLR4-/-, as indicated by reduced histological scores and letality. Because TLR4 is highly specific for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), these findings provide evidence that commensal gut bacteria aggravate the immunopathology of intestinal inflammation via TLR4-mediated sensing of bacterial LPS, which might play a key role in inflammatory process.",5.429089367909516,4.115703848186284

For some purposes, the simple identification of Brucella is adequate. However, PCR with IPS1 and IPS2 primers is a reliable tool for rapid identification of Brucella species and its differentiation from closely related organisms. A fundamental question that arises during epidemiological investigations of outbreaks is whether the outbreak strain is genetically related to a proposed strain. Highly discriminating genetic markers for characterizing bacterial strains can help in clarifying the genetic relationships among strains. The Brucella AMOS (AbortusMelitensisOvisSuis)-PCR assay was previously developed to identify and differentiate specific Brucella species. Material and methods: Twenty strains of B. melitensis isolated from humans and animals using traditional techniques during four field trips to rural areas in two regions of Kazakhstan. Total 360 people were examined. B. melitensis biovars 1, 2 and 3 were isolated in 18 cases out 130 individuals presumed to be infected with Brucella sp. Two B. melitensis biovar 2 were isolated from sheep milk. Twenty isolates were identified and tested by the conventional biochemical tests, PCR-based and Brucella AMOS PCR Results: Twenty isolates were identified and tested by the conventional biochemical tests, PCR-based and Brucella AMOS PCR. This included 6 isolates identified as B. melitensis biovar 1; 10-identified as B. melitensis biovar 2; 4-identified as B. melitensis biovar 3. The results of classical typing for 20 B. melitensis cultures isolated from humans and animals were confirmed at genetic level by PCR. The high specificity of this PCR-based assay was demonstrated by testing all of the biovars of twenty strains of B. melitensis. The Brucella AMOS PCR correctly identified each isolate as a B. melitensis. However due to AMOS, but not biological typing, genetic features of 2 strains of B. melitensis biovar1 and 2 have been found. Two B. melitensis biovar 1 and 2 have been isolated from the people with serological positive acute brucellosis (SAT: 1: 1600). Conclusion: The PCR-based test and AMOS-PCR could be used as a complementary test to identify genus Brucella and differentiate specific Brucella species. However, to explain further genetic distinctions, fingerprinting is required.",4.5847578578661246,3.7947816199774174

Methods: Women admitted to a University Hospital as inpatients during the 5-year study period were included in the study. Data were abstracted from clinical charts. Individuals were divided into two groups, those with normal (Pap I-II) and abnormal (Pap III-IV) cervical cytological screening results. Statistical methods were used to compare socio-demographic and clinical variables. Analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: A cohort of 75 women who had tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was included in the study. The mean age was 33.9 (range 19-56). Fifty-one individuals (68.0%) originated from Europe, 16 (21.3%) from Africa and eight (10.7%) from Asia. The overall prevalence of abnormal cytological smears was 29.5%. During the study period, 41 (54.7%) presented with normal and 34 (45.3%) with abnormal smears. Of these 34 women, 27 (79.4%) had cytological evidence of human papilloma virus infection (HPV). Herpes simplex virus infection was detected in seven (9.3%) women, Trichomonas vaginalis and Chlamydia in five (6.7%) and seven (9.3%), respectively. When comparing both groups, no significant association was found between socio-demographic determinants and the presence of dysplasia. However, a significant determinant for HPV infection was immunosuppression (CD 4 cell count 291 vs 488/ll; viral load 134.679 vs 16.102 RNA copies/ll). Numbers of cytological changes due to HPV infections occurred more frequently in this group (cytological evidence of infection 79.4 vs 24.4%; Condylomata acuminata 29.4 vs 7.3%). Conclusions: Cervical dysplasia due HPV infections appears to be highly correlated with the immunosupression in HIV positive women. 87.85% and other localisation 33.2%) and the rest with HSV-2. 50.46% of the patients are treated with different antiretroviral combinations. During monitorisation 67.5% of the treated patients and 61.3% of the untreated presented herpes recurrences (mean 4.2 ± 2.9 vs 3.9 ± 2.7). The recurrences were more frequent in severe immunosuprest patients (CD4<200), 76.4% vs 57.4%, p = 0.005. Recurrent ratio wasn't modified in patients with a good immune response to therapy. The recurrences were less frequent in patients with undetectable viral load, 58.6% vs detectable, 80%, (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Antiretroviral therapy and immune restoration do not influence the rate of herpetic reactivation.",5.404818677809414,3.0421877452406303

This result coincides with those found by Guan et al.28 and Wang et al.29 In Guan et al.'s work, the authors also suggested that SARS viruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets found in a live-animal market in Guangdong, China. Similarly, in Wang et al.'s work, the researchers found six palm civets at the restaurant were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus. They think that SARS cases at the restaurant were the result of recent interspecies transfer from the putative palm civet reservoir and not the result of continued circulation of SARS-CoV in the human population.",13.463590885991966,6.632968056230038

Indeed, it is not difficult to describe those consequences for all of the above ‘experiments of concern’. An example is altering the host range of a pathogen. If a pathogen can be changed in such a way that it can survive not only in e.g. animals, but also in human beings, this can lead to new diseases for mankind. Animal diseases become human diseases. And because antibiotics or other remedies for such new diseases do not (yet) exist, the consequences can be disastrous.

Group 2a betacoronaviruses, which have plus-strand RNA genomes, and the group A rotaviruses, with segmented dsRNA genomes, are unrelated RNA viruses with different replication strategies, yet both encode related 2′,5′-PDEs, ns2 and VP3, respectively (7, 8). Here we present the first evidence that a viral pathogen for humans, the rotavirus strain WA (46), also encodes a functional 2′,5′-PDE (Fig. 1B). In addition, many related viruses encode predicted or confirmed 2′,5′-PDEs, including additional 2a betacoronaviruses, human OC43 and HEC4408, bovine coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating virus, the torovirus and coronavirus superfamily member equine torovirus (Berne), and group A, B, and G rotaviruses (reviewed in reference 5). While the evolutionary origins of these viral 2′,5′-PDEs are unknown, we suggest that the host AKAP7 2′,5′-PDE domain coding sequence might have been captured through RNA recombination during viral infections in the distant past. Alternatively, the viral PDEs may have evolved from other vertebrate 2H phosphoesterases (9). The phylogenetic relationship of different species of AKAP7, VP3 and ns2, based on protein sequence data was explored by means of fast minimum evolution (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). While this analysis shows a close relationship among different species of AKAP7, VP3, pp1a, and ns2, it does not reveal whether this relationship is the result of divergent or convergent evolution (Fig. S3). Coronavirus mRNAs are transcribed from their genomes by a discontinuous process believed to involve switching of template by the viral replicase complex. During this process, there is a high rate of homologous recombination, reportedly up to 25%, observed during in vitro replication and in vivo (reviewed in reference 47); this high-frequency template switching may result in low-frequency copying of host mRNA. Indeed, sequences homologous to the 5′ end of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I coding regions are found on the 5′ end of the MHV HE gene, adjacent to the 3′ end of the ns2 open reading frame, and it was previously speculated that this was a result of homologous recombination between the MHV genome and host RNA (48). We suggest that AKAP7 PDE sequences have been acquired by a similar process and subsequently evolved into ns2. In support of this idea, an alignment of the amino acid sequences of different isoforms of AKAP7, ns2 and VP3, show extensive homology that extends beyond the His-h-Thr/Ser-h motifs (Fig. S1). Subsequent to randomly acquiring the AKAP7 CD coding sequence, the virus would have a selective advantage resulting in retention of the gene.",9.980342771201924,5.3344897359176064

Moreover, HKU4 prefers bat DPP4 over human DPP4 whereas the opposite is true for MERS-CoV.22,23 Thus, whereas SARS-CoV utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor, conserved across mammalian species,24 MERS-CoV binds to a genetic variant of DPP4 with analogs expressed only in humans, non-human primates, bats, and camelids.25,26 The emergence of MERS-CoV as a novel human pathogen has 2 remaining mysteries. First, the genetic alterations that have allowed a virus such as HKU4 that causes a mild, self-limited upper respiratory infection to become a lower respiratory pathogen of high mortality is unknown. And second, since MERS-CoV inefficiently utilizes bat DPP4 for cell entry it should have limited ability to persist in this animal. As discussed below, camels are efficient carriers of MERS-CoV.

Université Laval. Quebec. Canada 5 Halim.maaroufi@ibis.ulaval.ca 6 7 ABSTRACT The novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and can cause 8 serious acute respiratory illness syndromes, often fatal, called covid-19. It is an urgent priority to 9 better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms that will help in the development of 10 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics that are very important to people health and socioeconomic 11 stability around the world. The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key 12 factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane 13 fusion. Here the analysis of CoV-2 S protein revealed in S1subunit a B56-binding LxxIxE-like 14 motif that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This motif is absent in SARS-15 CoV and MERS-CoV. PP2A is a major family of serine/threonine phosphatases in eukaryotic cells. 16 Phosphatases and kinases are big players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during 17 pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses use multiple strategies to target 18 PP2A in order to manipulate host's antiviral responses. The latest studies have indicated that 19 SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained inflammation in the host. Therefore, by controlling acute 20 inflammation; it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight 21 covid-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a 22 target for the development of a bioactive peptide and ligand inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.",12.15168438152572,4.508991673749041

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and its 20 closely related coronaviruses formed four well supported clades (Fig. 2) . The two SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04 (from Wuhan) and SNU01 (from Korea patient) were clustered with SARS-CoV-related strains to form clade 1, belonging to beta-coronavirus lineage B. The Compared with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, there were 293 nucleotideswere altered while only 29 amino acids were altered in SARS-CoV-2; their ratio was as high as 9.07. However, this ratio detected in the comparisons of other human coronaviruses with their similar animal coronaviruses was less than 5.0. For example, the ratio of human SARS-CoV Tor2 to bat SARS-like CoVs LYRa11 was 4.81; that ratio of human MERS-CoV EMC2012 to bat SARS-like CoVs RSA2011 was 2.80; that ratio of human coronavirus 229E to bat coronavirus HKU2 was 4.55.
