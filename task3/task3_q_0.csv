Current evidence suggests that the virus originated from wild animals and birds (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/) [2] . To date, more than 2,800 deaths and 87,000 confirmed positive cases have been reported around the world, making COVID-19 a major health concern. As a first line of treatment, along with the antiviral drugs, clinicians are using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the S1 domain of the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein [1] . Very recently (25 January 2020) the first and complete genome sequence of COVID-19 was deposited in the NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3) providing the key to the likely structure and glycosylation pattern of the viral proteins and consequent mode of interaction with the host cell. Similar to most other coronaviruses, the outer membrane spike glycoprotein, known for its glycosylation [3] , is the prime host interacting protein with host cell targets (such as ACE2, CD26, Ezrin, cyclophilins and other cell adhesion factors) important for cell adhesion and virulence [4, 5] . However, the specific host cell factors or proteins that facilitate the novel COVID-19 remain elusive. The current study was thus undertaken to predict the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein structure and glycan shield pattern that has great implications for understanding the viral camouflage and mode of cell entry, potentially assisting the development of new vaccines, antibodies, small-molecule drugs and screening of the human host targets.",32.39344503491398,14.917660994363295

The Belgian Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products released a statement on 16th March 2020 stating 'It is well known that NSAIDs and corticosteroids can lead to serious complications'. Equally, a report by French Authorities suggested the use of ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients was detrimental to patient condition and recovery.

The number of city lockdowns in China had increased to more than 80 by the beginning of February. Besides, tourist sites were closed across the country, public gatherings were cancelled and people was encouraged to stay at home [13] .

Given the limited resources available and time-sensitivity of the COVID-19 outbreak, we adopted the snowball sampling strategy. The snowballing sampling strategy was not based on a random selection of the sample, and the study population did not reflect the actual pattern of the general population. Furthermore, it would be ideal to conduct a prospective study on the same group of participants after a period. Due to ethical requirements on anonymity and confidentiality, we were not allowed to collect contact details and personal information from the respondents. As a result, we could not conduct a prospective study that would provide a concrete finding to support the need for a focused public health initiative. There was an oversampling of a particular network of peers (e.g., students), leading to selection bias. As a result, the conclusion was less generalizable to the entire population, particularly less educated people. Another limitation is that self-reported levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression and stress may not always be aligned with assessment by mental health professionals. Similarly, respondents might have provided socially desirable responses in terms of the satisfaction with the health information received and precautionary measures. Lastly, the number of respondents with contact history and who had sought medical consultations was very small. Our findings could not be generalized to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. Notwithstanding the above limitations, this study provides invaluable information on the initial psychological responses 2 weeks after the outbreak of COVID-19 from respondents across 194 cities in China. Our results could be used as a historical reference. Most importantly, our findings directly inform the development of psychological interventions that can minimize psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the outbreak of COVID-19 and provide a baseline for evaluating prevention, control, and treatment efforts throughout the remainder of the COVID-19 epidemic, which is still ongoing at the time of preparing this manuscript.",38.099120259153125,16.26475735302125

Subsequent to the WHO declaration, the United States Surgeon General proclaimed a formal advisory to cancel elective surgeries at hospitals due to the concern that elective procedures may contribute to the spreading of the coronavirus within facilities and use up medical resources needed to manage a potential surge of coronavirus cases [6] . The announcement escalated to a nationwide debate regarding the safety and feasibility of continuing to perform elective surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic [7, 8] . Many health care professionals erroneously interpreted the Surgeon General's recommendation as a ""blanket directive"" to cancel all elective procedures in the Country [9] . This notion was vehemently challenged in an open letter to the Surgeon General on behalf of United States hospitals [10] . The letter outlined a significant concern that the recommendation could be ""interpreted as recommending that hospitals immediately stop performing elective surgeries without clear agreement on how we classify various levels of necessary care "" [10] .

Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care, such as the one occurring in the affected regions of Italy. As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time [1] . The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. There is a short window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.

In the communication layer (layer A), the classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemiological model 43 is used to describe the dissemination of information about the disease. In the SIR model, each node can be in one of the three states: (1) susceptible state (S) in which the individual has not received any information about the disease, (2) informed state(I), where the individual is aware of disease and is capable of transmitting the information to other individuals in the same layer, and (3) refractory state (R), in which the individual has received the information but is not willing to pass it on to other nodes. At each time step, the information can propagate from every informed node to all its neighboring nodes. If a neighbor is in the susceptible state, it will be informed with probability b A . At the same time, each informed node can enter the recovering phase with probability m A . Once an informed node is recovered, it will remain in this state for all subsequent time. A node in layer A will get the information about the disease once its counterpart node in layer B is infected.

The sharing of data has also been quicker, as immediately after the virus' genetic sequence was discovered, Chinese scientists were able to share the information with the WHO, thus helping in its identification and enabling the auctioning of precautionary measures in other countries. Latest technological tools have also allowed for the receipt of information in realtime, in contrast to traditional epidemiological approaches that would have required months to identify the outbreak type [25] . Similarly, though substantial data and information on the disease has been shared, Wetsman [26] acknowledges that there is a lack of some vital information, like the ease of spread of the virus from person-to-person, and this is a key to containing the disease as interactions between people from different parts of the globe are still active. This hindrance can be made further possible as many cities advance in their smart and safe city model implementation towards constructing sufficient soft and hard urban infrastructures equipped with, for example, thermal imagery sensors to allow for early detections. However, while that is the case, data access to many is a challenge because the information is often seen as being sensitive for national security reasons, whilst at the same time, acknowledging that a virus outbreak is an equal threat to both national security and the economy.",36.33118245321714,15.305380561564078

This is valid as smart cities host a rich array of technological products [6, 7] that can assist in early detection of outbreaks; either through thermal cameras or Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and early discussions could render efforts towards better management of similar situations in case of future potential outbreaks, and to improve the health fabric of cities generally.

All these methods have an advantage to overcome the requirement of cycling which is compulsory in case of PCR-based techniques or real-time PCR. However, the mechanism and progress of PCLSR is different and relies on formation of 3 independent prerequisite spiral products. Similarly, to CPA or PSR the final cross-linked products form complex entities which result from target DNA sequence multiplication. The final products detection is mediated after addition of double-DNA binding fluorescent dye including SYBR Green ® I. Having the possibility to trace the reaction progress, the developed PCLSR can also be performed using real-time PCR system as a semi-quantitative technique. The results are finally registered as fluorescence of samples containing ASFV DNA under UV light as greenish fluorescence, or the presence of fluorescent curves at a particular cycle of the reaction using real-time PCR system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of development of the PCLSR as an alternative assay for other described isothermal detection methods. The PCLSR presents a simple alternative for real-time PCR techniques recommended by OIE or EURL for ASF diagnosis and hopefully might further be considered as an official method.

SARS-CoV-2 is not only phylogenetically closely related with SARS-CoV, an etiological agent of SARS, but also uses a same receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV does. Thus, even though ""Wuhan pneumonia"" has been called with various other disease names such as ""new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)"" and now as ""coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"", we feel that it may be more appropriate to refer to ""Wuhan pneumonia"" as ""SARS-2"" and the previous SARS as ""SARS-1"" if necessary. The etiological agent for ""Wuhan pneumonia"" has been changed from ""2019-nCoV"" to ""SARS-CoV-2"". A further change of ""COVID-19"" into ""SARS-2"" is logical and reasonable for streamlining taxonomy between disease agent and disease. In this minireview, we evaluate natural and social factors influencing both 2002 and 2019 SARSs in order to understand some common epidemiological features that may be beneficial for controlling the ongoing epidemic and also for preventing future outbreak.

It was also already stopped using the first line of defence in another thirty Chinese provinces and surrounding countries in Asia. Then, on the 28 th of February, the first estimates of death rates were published, suggesting that it was a disease with a death rate significantly lower than that of SARS and MERS [3, 4] . At that time, it was reasonable to expect that the epidemic could soon be stopped.

The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002-2003 epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases. Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility.

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare. This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available. However, at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected, to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years, too. There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months. Some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in Italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels, and those above expected levels will then be attributed to COVID-19.",30.980932042558607,13.418935314760471

Acute respiratory infections (ARI) cause more deaths in children < 5 years with most cases reported from India (43 million), China (21 million), Pakistan (10 million), Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nigeria (56 million) [2] . Respiratory infections can be caused by many viruses, both DNA and RNA. These include the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), human Parainfluenza Virus (HPIV), Influenza A Virus (Flu A), Influenza B Virus (Flu B), human Adenovirus (HAdV), human Coronavirus (HCoV), human Rhinovirus (HRV), human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human Bocavirus (HBoV) [3] . A new wave of viral diagnosis was established with the development of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques in the 1990s [4] . PCR is more sensitive and rapid than conventional methods for detection of respiratory viruses. Different respiratory viruses present with similar signs and symptoms and can't be differentiated symptomatically or clinically. Tests capable of rapid simultaneous identification of various viruses at the same time can help expedite initiation of appropriate therapy. Uniplex RT-PCR requires individual amplification of each virus under study which is expensive, time consuming and laborious [5] . To overcome this, multiplex real-time PCRs targeting the detection of multiple pathogens simultaneously have been developed commercially but they are very expensive.

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty.

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",27.466401091225254,11.529046645614065

In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",38.26319364616907,14.621684304062255

The effort to identify predictors of who gets infected and who among these becomes symptomatic requires first and foremost the ability to define the disease. The advent of cheap, rapid whole-genome sequencing of pathogens is the latest in a historic progression of the ways in which epidemiologists classify disease; classification methods have progressed from clinical and epidemiological definitions of syndromes to microbiologic characterization of pathogens from infected individuals (Figure 1) , and now to the use of pathogen genotype and genome sequence. Improved characterizations of pathogens and deeper understanding of their biology have driven the development of diagnostic techniques, vaccines and therapies, and have helped guide strategies for maximizing the impact of these tools for disease control and treatment. An example of this progression can be seen in the study of influenza, from the identification of influenza virus as the etiologic agent [1, 2] , whereas formerly it was thought to be bacterial [3] , to the use of genetic and antigenic information to inform vaccine development [4, 5] , diagnostics [6] and treatment selection [7] .

The concept of Information Diet was introduced by Clay Johnson for the first time. He believes consumers should take responsibility for the type of information they consume, likewise the rational consumption of food. He also argues that there must be a sustainable news movement, like a sustainable food movement that has already started in the US. In other words, people and even governments are not capable of dealing with the media to a great extent, but people can create their own information diets, like food diet. Therefore, information consumers are advised to consume information in a limited way. However, they must demand complete and credible news, not news that is based on emotional content and full of advertisements"" (4). In the present Coronavirus crisis, some people spend most of their time studying related information regarding Covid-19 in written and virtual media; Meanwhile, they are unwilling to spend time exercising at home, talking to their families, playing with their children or doing other useful tasks such as studying, watching movies and so on. To seriously address these problems in the Coronavirus crisis, not only people must have optimum consumption of appropriate information, but also consuming information should comply with specific terms and conditions. For example, children should not be exposed to the news related to the Coronavirus, because this information increases anxiety and causes other psychological problems among them. The elderly is also vulnerable to the spread of information, and should be provided with reliable and limited information, and they should not be given the ongoing news. On the other hand, individuals should be able to distinguish between high quality and poor quality information, since much of the information regarding Covid-19 is invalid and is produced and published for economic, political, social, and in general profitable purposes (disinformation). Nowadays, in-formation is being provided every day, and by contemplating on and reviewing the publication of statistics related to the Coronavirus crisis on websites, blogs, social media, television and satellite channels etc., it can be understood that the overload of information has already occurred. Hence, providing people with all kinds of health literature is the only option. Although people may not have the ability to control the production and supply of the information nowadays, each of them must control the extent and type of the information which they consume. Therefore, in order to achieve a comprehensive information diet in societies, people need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills of health information literacy, media health literacy, media literacy and health literacy. Currently these trainings can only be delivered through the mass media. Delivering these skills requires specific knowledge and skills which health information professionals (medical librarians) poses, and they can train other people in the society through mass media relying on their abilities.",39.469218752679694,17.177088077529383

To label the PEDVs, we introduced DSPE-PEG-DBCO to the viral envelope via virus propagation in the DSPE-PEG-DBCO cultured Vero cells. The DSPE-PEG-DBCO has little cytotoxicity to the Vero cells, moreover, this strategy does not affect the activity or production of the viruses. After labeled with QDs by copper-free click chemistry reaction specifically, these labeled viruses can be used for single virus tracking to analyze the dynamics of the PEDV infection. Using real time single particle tracking, the infection motions of 60 PEDVs along the MTs in the host Vero cells were recorded and analyzed. It shows that most PEDVs had specific motion along the MTs: in the CM region, PEDVs performed restricted motion mode with relatively stable speed; while in the CC and MTOC regions, the velocity of PEDVs both followed the slow-fast-slow pattern, but in different motion modes. Though return movements of small amount of PEDVs were also observed in Vero cells, most PEDVs still invaded the Vero cells along MTs in the specific motions. According to the optimized labeling method as well as the detailed analysis on the PEDV motion along the MTs via single particle tracking, it is believed that this work provides direct PEDV infection model, which proposes important references for further study on the PEDV infection mechanism, and promotes the development of new vaccines and effective PED treatments.

It has been shown that 2019-nCov enters the cell through the ACE2 cell receptor in the same way as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [2] . 2019-nCoV effectively uses angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) as a receptor for cell invasion [3] . Primary non-specific reported symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection at the prodromal phase are malaise, fever, and dry cough. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms are fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%) [4] .",29.596110778346457,11.057271077909249

Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others.

For long-time predictions, more complicated mathematical models are necessary. For example, a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was used in [2] . Nevertheless, complicated models need more effort for unknown parameters identification. This procedure may be especially difficult if reliable data are limited.",49.30668644911177,16.717081757209147

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",37.9178871869537,15.850448153001313

Furthermore, the limited cancer patient population described in this first report from the literature, was curiously characterized by the lack of individuals receiving anticancer immunotherapy. Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [7] . Cancer patients undergoing treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) currently used in everyday practice to treat solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, renal carcinoma, urothelial cancers and head and neck carcinoma constitute a growing oncological population [8] .

One symptom, which has now been repeatedly reported in COVID-19 patients across Europe and Asia, is the loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia). Some patients have also reported dysgeusia, referring to a change in taste in the mouth. However, to date this information has primarily been noted in news reports including those from The New York Times, The Independent, Sky News and CNN with no case reports being listed in peerreviewed scientific literature. Nevertheless, this topic is of interest in oncology since patients receiving some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or immune therapy often experience similar symptoms as side-effects. Though it also needs to be noted that anosmia and ageusia may occur through many other means including other respiratory infections, nasal polyps, head trauma, certain medications, cooking indoors and even age. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to summarise the evidence on the existence of anosmia as an emerging COVID-19 symptom in order to better inform both oncology patients and clinicians.",31.128387710491126,12.025241023166732

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) . There is currently no definitive cure for COVID-19, and the treatment regimens prescribed for patients are the main treatments that have previously been effective in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and chloroquine phosphate is the * Corresponding Author: Ali Rismanbaf; Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Hezar Jerib Street, Isfahan, Iran.

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",29.592769593130438,13.254652024851055

The use of these multiplexed analysis systems has been widely accepted previously, as a means for augmenting frontline traditional diagnostics, as they offer many advantages over traditional monoplex molecular technologies. Microarrays are also highly amenable to multiplexing, obviating the need for multiple tests per patient [37, 38] , with the potential for saving time and cost.

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",34.88659256946785,12.583745425511001

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",29.268684822355056,11.598908597540875

Firstly, COVID-19 is a novel disease just recently recognised. The first version of a guideline for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 was announced on 16 January 2020. It took time for the medical professionals to learn about the virus and the disease in order to make correct diagnosis. Secondly, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires two independent confirmatory laboratory tests, which should be taken at least 1 day apart. Our results showed that the lag correlation is shorter for the suspected than for laboratory-confirmed cases.

Perhaps we will learn some important lessons from these patients, so as to inform our efforts going forward. For instance, should AngII be used for all COVID-19 patients in shock? Should it be considered earlier in the course of disease, perhaps as a first-line vasopressor? Finally, and more controversially, should we evaluate the modulating effects of AngII on ACE2 for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients without shock?

This is perhaps even more pertinent in the face of a new virus whose imaging features can be varied and unfamiliar. Indeed, it has long been recognised that breaking down technological barriers to contributing imaging studies directly from a picture archiving and communications system (PACS) viewer to a central imaging repository would make teaching and research in the National Health Service (NHS) more efficient and accurate. Overcoming such a bottleneck would also deliver the potential to exponentially upskill the radiology workforce in the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, in what is currently a highly dynamic situation. By bringing together thoracic CT expertise across the UK, a central COVID-19 imaging repository and database can help reduce unwarranted diagnostic variation, provide better quality care for patients, and provide a resource to accumulate knowledge rapidly.

COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality. We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households. 5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities. We need to continue to inform, advocate for, and empower local communities and to lobby governments and policymakers to ensure that tuberculosis, as well as COVID-19, remain high on the global agenda.

As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the host−virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak.

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.

Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19.

Several abnormalities also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection. 16 In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation have been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3",31.482166619153347,13.967918075986738

This suggests some potential difference from SARS and MERS in the pathogenesis of coronavirus [2] . There is also a potential repressed immune function in COVID-19 patients with the hypo-albuminemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and decreased percentage of CD8 + T cell [2, 7] . Recent reports suggest that in some COVID-19 patients, although being negative for the viral nucleic acid test, still sometimes present with a high level of inflammation. A clinical trial using certolizumab pegol (a TNF blocker) along with other anti-virus therapies may have beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread rapidly around the globe, including Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. 1 The 2019 novel coronavirus is likely similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. They belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and can cause severe respiratory disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory failure. 2 Tracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation is the mainstay therapy to correct hypoxaemia. Preoxygenation with the standard bag-valve mask oxygenation followed by rapid-sequence intubation has been proposed in non-severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation to reduce the risk of aspiration and desaturation. However, a previous study reported that 23% of patients had SpO 2 <90% during intubation. 3 Thus far, more than 80000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China.

Preventive measures for COVID-19, including case and contact tracing, quarantine and screening, as well as education to encourage good hand hygiene practices, should be in place. Additional and pre-emptive measures must be taken for malaria control in these countries, anticipating the potential challenge that would be faced by the public health system during an outbreak of COVID-19. In the case of Ebola, it was estimated that malaria cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone could have increased by up to 1 million in 2014 as a result of a cessation of distribution of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs). 10 Governments and health leaders in malaria-endemic regions must ensure that such stresses to medical infrastructure are minimised in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19. Resource allocation should be optimised whenever possible to ensure minimal disruption to malaria control should COVID-19 management become necessary. Management of medical supplies and stockpiling of surgical masks and other protective equipment should be done in advance and medical staff should be adequately trained in their use. In cases of emergency, mass drug administration and the distribution of ITNs might be considered for short-term malaria relief in hyperendemic areas. Such measures would also aid efforts in COVID-19 management by reducing the strain on medical resources and minimising confounding factors in diagnosis. Previous successful implementation of such measures occurred during Ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone in 2014-15 and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018, in accordance with WHO guidelines. 11, 12 In malaria-endemic regions, malaria diagnostics should be systematically added to fever management, including for suspected cases of COVID-19, and health-care facilities should be well stocked with artemisinin combination therapy drugs.

By March 10, 2020, 116 166 cases have been reported globally, causing 4088 deaths. The epidemic has spread to 118 countries around the world. 2 With immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy, pregnant women could be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading, maternal management and fetal safety become a major concern, but there is scarce information of assessment and management of pregnant women infected with COVID-19, and the potential risk of vertical transmission is unclear. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Nan Yu and colleagues 3 report the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancy with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Seven pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were assessed and the onset symptoms were similar to those reported in non-pregnant adults with COVID-19. All patients received oxygen therapy and antiviral treatment in isolation. All patients had caesarean section after consultation with a multidisciplinary team and the outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and one was found to be infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth.

As demonstrated in this report, the development of mild COVID-19 illness was insidiously initiated and persisted for a long period. The prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 detection in naso-oropharyngeal specimens of the COVID-19 patients with mild illness is of concern in epidemic areas. Clinical manifestations of viral respiratory infections range from asymptomatic or flu-like symptoms such as fever, nonproductive or productive cough, myalgia, rhinorrhea, and sore throat, to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organs failure. 10 Various viral pathogens cause community-acquired infections during the cold season in Taiwan. Of which, influenza A/B, human Metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common. 11 The lack of specificity for clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and chest 13, 14 is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic or presented flu-like symptoms. 15, 16 Under this circumstances, quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients and the application of rapid detection tools for etiology confirmation is strongly recommended.

Compounding this challenge is the geographical variation in the peak of the pandemic within the United States, and the significant delay in restoration of normal health care operations after the immediate threat has passed. The length of this delay is unknown but could be many months subsequent to the peak which poses distinct challenges for rescheduling procedures.

It is critical to reiterate that although viral clearance is important, clinical outcomes are much more relevant to patients. There currently are no data to recommend the use of HCQ as prophylaxis for COVID-19, although we eagerly await data from trials under way. Thus, we discourage its offlabel use until justified and supply is bolstered. The HCQ shortage not only will limit availability to patients with COVID-19 if efficacy is truly established but also represents a real risk to patients with rheumatic diseases who depend on HCQ for their survival.

The ripple effect of the COVID-19 outbreak could potentially bring major challenges to worldwide health systems and have far-reaching consequences on the global economy if the spread of the virus is not effectively controlled. 1, 2, 4 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are relatively large viruses containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome encapsulated within a membrane envelope. The viral membrane is studded with glycoprotein spikes that give coronaviruses their crownlike appearance (Figure 3 ). While coronaviruses infect both humans and animals, certain types of animals such as bats that host the largest variety of coronaviruses appear to be immune to coronavirus-induced illness. 5 There are four classes of coronaviruses designated as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The betacoronavirus class includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus (MERS-CoV), and the COVID-19 causative agent SARS-CoV-2. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lower respiratory system to cause viral pneumonia, but it may also affect the gastrointestinal system, heart, kidney, liver, and central nervous system leading to multiple organ failure. 6, 7 Current information indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible/contagious than SARS-CoV. 8 Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, this disease has spread rapidly around the globe. Considering the potential threat of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been racing to understand this new virus and the pathophysiology of this disease to uncover possible treatment regimens and discover effective therapeutic agents and vaccines. To support the current research and development, CAS has produced a special report to provide an overview of published scientific information with an emphasis on patents in the CAS content collection. It highlights antiviral strategies involving small molecules and biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases.

The UNDRR asked national disaster management agencies to continue with the development of their preparedness and response capacities to include health emergencies as a top priority, alongside earthquakes, floods, storms and other natural hazards (UNDRR, 2020). It also highlighted the importance of silo-breaking in disaster prevention and management, notably the silos between disaster management and health workers.

The treatment that have so far been attempted showed that 75 patients were administrated existing antiviral drugs. The course of treatment included twice a day oral administration of 75 mg oseltamivir, 500 mg lopinavir, 500 mg ritonavir and the intravenous administration of 0·25 g ganciclovir for 3-14 days [26] .

Abstract: Background: The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions.

Radiotherapy is delivered to nearly 50% of cancer patients, a particularly vulnerable group given their older age, frequent comorbidities, and underlying cancer diagnosis. 2 Prostate cancer is frequently treated with radiation and the most common solid tumor in men; it is a heterogeneous disease where timely therapy is indicated for some cases, and where watchful waiting, active surveillance, or deferral of treatment could be acceptable for others. 3, 4 Given the current epidemic crisis, delaying radiotherapy treatment (which requires multiple visits to healthcare facilities) for prostate cancer patients may potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic exposure to COVID-19. At the healthcare system level, when clinically appropriate, reducing visits conserves limited hospital resources (e.g. personal protective equipment (PPE)) for use by health-care workers who will have to care for the potentially vast number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The decision to delay life-saving cancer treatment in a time of a resource-intensive pandemic represents a clinical conundrum without modern precedent. In these exigent circumstances, guidelines as to how to manage patients who present with prostate cancer would be valuable for the practicing clinician. This manuscript attempts guidance based on rapid expert opinion as to how to manage prostate cancer patients requiring radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.",34.766957288398345,14.560522033666471

The COVID-19 forms a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus [25] . Based on the genetic sequence identity and the phylogenetic reports, COVID-19 is sufficiently different from SARS-CoV and it can thus be considered as a new betacoronavirus that infects humans. The COVID-19 most likely developed from bat origin coronaviruses. Another piece of evidence that supports the COVID-19 is of bat origin is the existence of a high degree of homology of the ACE2 receptor from a diversity of animal species, thus implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for COVID-19 infections [20] . Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame on gene 8, which is a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs. However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor [5] .",34.53467136885717,14.077020529837391

Efforts have been made to search for a reservoir host or intermediate carriers from which the infection may have spread to humans. Initial reports identified two species of snakes that could be a possible reservoir of the COVID-19. However, to date, there has been no consistent evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds [10, 18] . Genomic sequence analysis of COVID-19 showed 88% identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [19, 20] , indicating that mammals are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans. Several reports have suggested that person-to-person transmission is a likely route for spreading COVID-19 infection. This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan [13, 21] . Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth. This is important because pregnant mothers are relatively more susceptible to infection by respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia (https://www.thelancet.com, DOI:https://doi.org/10. 1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3).",31.11342123827292,12.211230067296164

The first cases were reported in December 2019 [4] . From December 18, 2019 through December 29, 2019, five patients were hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome and one of these patients died [5] . By January 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, less than half of these patients had underlying diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [6] . These patients were presumed to be infected in that hospital, likely due to nosocomial infection. It was concluded that the COVID-19 is not a super-hot spreading virus (spread by one patient to many others), but rather likely spread due to many patients getting infected at various locations throughout the hospital through unknown mechanisms. In addition, only patients that got clinically sick were tested, thus there were likely many more patients that were presumably infected. As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus (COVID-19) were reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China [7] . The China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to January 22, 2020. On January 25, 2020, a total of 1975 cases were confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths [8] . Another report on January 24, 2020 estimated the cumulative incidence in China to be 5502 cases [9] . As of January 30, 2020, 7734 cases have been confirmed in China and 90 other cases have also been reported from a number of countries that include Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Japan, Singapore, Republic of Korea, United Arab Emirates, United States, The Philippines, India, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, and Germany. The case fatality rate was calculated to be 2.2% (170/7824) [10] .

This includes the patient's initial mild symptoms at presentation and progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness [11] . Further, the first case of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 was reported in the US on January 30, 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/media/ releases/2020/p0130). The CDC has so far screened > 30,000 passengers arriving at US airports for the novel coronavirus. Following such initial screening, 443 individuals have been tested for coronavirus infection in 41 states in the USA. Only 15 (3.1%) were tested positive, 347 were negative and results on the remaining 81 are pending (https:// www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov).

Generally, we must consider that a general rule cannot be found for all countries and all diseases, but each one of the latter requires deep statistical analysis; a pattern of a disease in one country may differ in another. It is possible, however, to build systems based on internet data, social media, search engines, etc., but each system requires methods, which can be similar or not. The global pattern of human behavior and globalization can help this, since internet allows people to interact to an electronic system (such as Google Search) or to each other (social media). It is true that internet-based approaches are logistically and economically appealing. However, they do not have the capacity to replace traditional surveillance systems; they should not be viewed as an alternative, but rather as an extension (Milinovich, Williams, & Hu, 2014) . Of course, many people could say that the previous statement is thought to be based on today's technology. In the future, as the research continues, technology will further advance and the credibility of internet-based systems will probably be better and wide across the world. The findings of the researches until today show that the potential of creating such internet surveillance systems becomes more possible over time.",29.388089298541228,12.669256847865588

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7e99.4]; P<0.01). Conclusions: Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections.

The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to numerous countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study reveals that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We find a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship is confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence reveals that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirm the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear.

To develop a simple, rapid, accurate, and high-throughput detection method for diagnosis and differential diagnosis on swine enteric coronaviruses, specific primers and probes were designed based on the highly conserved regions of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) N, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) M, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) M, and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) N genes respectively. A TaqMan-probe-based multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect these swine enteric coronaviruses. The results showed that the limit of detection can reach as low as 10 copies in singular real-time RT-qPCR assays and 100 copies in multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay, with all correlation coefficients (R 2 ) at above 0.99, and the amplification efficiency at between 90 and 120%. This multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay demonstrated high sensitivity, extreme specificity, and excellent repeatability. The multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay was then employed to detect the swine enteric coronavirus from 354 field diarrheal samples. The results manifested that TGEVand PDCoV were the main pathogens in these samples, accompanied by co-infections. This well-established multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay provided a rapid, efficient, specific, and sensitive tool for detection of swine enteric coronaviruses.",29.620463033428763,13.037396181592186

Further, the lack of identified COVID-19 cases in countries with far closer travel ties to Iran suggests that cases in these countries are probably being missed rather than being truly absent.

The idea was that surveillance for H1N1 influenza virus was not intense during the early days of the pandemic in Mexico, the source location, and that detection would be far more sensitive in travellers leaving Mexico, who would be screened when returning home as a means of preventing introductions of cases into destination locations. 2, 3 Reports that health systems in Wuhan were overwhelmed, and that many cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were not being counted, led to the use of outgoing traveller data to estimate the time-specific risk of COVID-19 in Wuhan. 1 This estimate, in turn, has been used to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection by a specific date in Wuhan and, from there (typically assuming exponential growth and no appreciable depletion of susceptible people), the cumulative number of cases. Two important assumptions underlie this calculation. First, it assumes that detection of cases in the destination location has been 100% sensitive and specific, whether cases are detected at the airport (with symptoms) or later after arrival at their destination (incubating during travel). Second, it assumes that travellers have the same prevalence of infection as does the average resident of Wuhan, so the prevalence inferred in travellers can be directly applied in Wuhan. Here, we consider the extent to which these two assumptions are justified and the expected effects they will have on our understanding of the current outbreak of COVID-19.",29.848601913073765,13.869144508706219

However, the majority of cases (about 85%) have occurred in mainland China. Following an incubation period ranging from 2 to 13 days, most (>80%) symptomatic patients have reported a fever and cough, and some have developed shortness of breath (4). Although COVID-19 is generally thought to be a milder illness compared to SARS and MERS-CoV, nearly 3200 deaths have occurred, yielding a casefatality rate of about 3% (versus approximately 10% for SARS-CoV and approximately 35% for MERS-CoV) (5) . This mortality rate is likely an overestimation, due to the high probability that many infected individuals have not sought medical attention and laboratory confirmation (6) . It is important to emphasize that details regarding this outbreak are rapidly evolving, and therefore, the full extent of COVID-19's impact is still unknown. That being said, the nonspecific clinical features of COVID-19, along with the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus) in many parts of the world, have presented a major challenge to public health officials and healthcare providers. This outbreak represents an opportunity for government agencies, the public health sector, industry, and clinical laboratories to partner and develop a robust and sustainable system that would allow for rapid development, production, dissemination, and implementation of diagnostic tests for infectious agents of global health concern.",30.729947844202222,12.23589291440369

Second, the lack of sufficient medical information on SARS meant that, although there was a rapid flow of information, often this was not robust scientific information.

This hypothesis has led some European countries to produce initial policies relying on decreased transmission rates during the summer months, 3 and the belief that African countries will face smaller epidemics than their European counterparts. However, no strong evidence base exists for such claims; SARS-CoV-2 might have simply arrived later to warmer countries. We used data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Baltimore, MD, USA) to plot the cumulative number of cases since the diagnosis of both the first patient and the first five patients by country, both in Europe and Africa (figure). Although the first confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred later in west Africa than in Europe, once these first cases were confirmed in west Africa, the expansion in the number of confirmed COVID-19 was rapid. Of particular concern are Burkina Faso and Senegal, which saw sharp increases in the number of cases soon after the initial cases were confirmed in these countries. Cases in both countries might evolve in a similar way to what was observed in European countries with the most expansive epidemics (ie, Italy and Spain, where SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly after case number five was detected).

Real-time is more rapid and sensitive than traditional techniques, including virus isolation by cell culture. Various investigators have reported several formats for real-time RTPCR, but none of those assays were validated by a defined sample panel. Therefore, the WHO approved only the CDC-recommended realtime RTPCR assay for confirmation of infection by pandemic S-OIV H1N1 influenza. However, the existing WHO-approved, CDC real-time RTPCR system has several limitations, including the high cost because of the use of large number of primer and probe sets. One of the major limitations of the WHO-approved, CDC real-time RTPCR is the requirement of an expensive real-time PCR instrument that can be afforded only by referral laboratories with good financial resources. Still another limitation of the real-time RTPCR test system is that it is time consuming, requiring 3 to 4 hours. In addition, the limitation of all PCR methods is that falsenegative results may occur because of sequence variations in primer and probe targets, and that is particularly relevant for the detection of emerging viruses.

However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14] . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides [15] . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients [16] . 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes [17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 [18, 19] . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence [20] . Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.",30.495926834314705,11.550607929450148

Therefore, the development of a rapid and simple method for on-site detection of SARS-CoV is crucial for the identification and prevention of future SARS outbreaks. In this study, a simple colorimetric and multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed to rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It can be visually detected based on color change and monitored in real-time with fluorescent signals. The performance of this assay, based on six primers targeting open reading frame (ORF1b) and nucleocapsid (N) genes located in different regions of the SARS-CoV, was compared with real-time RT-PCR assay using various concentrations of target genes. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was comparable to that of real-time RT-PCR assay and therefore a few target RNA to 10 4 -10 5 copies could be detected within a short period of time (20-25 min). In addition, we established a multiplex real-time LAMP assay to simultaneously detect two target regions within the SARS-CoV genome. Two target sequences were amplified by specific primers in the same reaction tube and revealed that it was able to detect down to 10 5 copies.

The capacity for this entry point surveillance should be anticipated and built in to any disaster-ready ED information system.

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",37.46734502425987,13.890530472225642

It is mentioned in a recent study includes 21 symptomatic patients at the time of initial presentation that CT findings are variable, ranging from normal to multiple lobes involvement and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patients show different radiologic progression (Chung et al., 2020) .

How can the past assist in the real-time management of the crisis? What insights can be gleaned from the ongoing epidemic for future disease preparedness and prevention? Lurking in the background of these interrogatives is a more or less explicit accusation: why haven't past lessons been learned? The gist of some commentaries seems to be: ""there is almost nothing surprising about this pandemic"". 2 The history-as-lessons approach pivots on the assumption that epidemics are structurally comparable events, wherever and whenever they take place. The COVID-19 outbreak ""creates a sense of déjà vu"" with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 3 Citing early estimates of the disease's infectiousness, based on an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, 4 comparisons have been drawn with the 1918-19 influenza pandemic. 5 Although in some respects the outbreak of COVID-19 presents a compelling argument for why history matters, there are problems with analogical views of the past because they constrain our ability to grasp the complex place-and-time-specific variables that drive contemporary disease emergence. A lessons approach to epidemics produces what Kenneth Burke, borrowing from the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen, called ""trained incapacity""-""that state of affairs whereby one's very abilities can function as blindnesses"". 6 Habitual modes of thinking can diminish our capacity to make lateral connections. When the present is viewed through the lens of former disease outbreaks, we typically focus on similitudes and overlook important differences. In other words, analogies create blind spots. As Burke commented, ""a way of seeing is also a way of not seeing-a focus on object A involves a neglect of object B"". 6 A lessons approach to the past, which usually comes from outside the discipline of history, reinforces an idea of the past as a series of interlinked crises that offer instructive insights into cause and effect. 7 Historians need to push back against easy analogies and examine the specific contexts of outbreaks, asking, for example, in what ways SARS and COVID-19 are in fact comparable.

In the last decade, substantial investments have been made in surveillance systems for early detection of natural infectious disease clusters and of intentional acts of bioterrorism. Previous studies demonstrate that surveillance is useful in detecting specified communicable diseases. Such systems include the sentinel provider system (USA) [12] , sentinel physician networks (European countries) [13] , influenza surveillance system (Japan) [14] , Australian sentinel practice research network (Australia) [15] , epidemiological surveillance networks (France) [16] , electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) pharmacy (England) [17] , infectious diseases surveillance system (Japan) [18] , ambulatory-care-based syndromic surveillance system (USA) [19] , real-time syndrome surveillance (Canada) [20] , and infectious disease prevention and control system (Germany) [21] . A categorization of computerized ENID surveillance systems by the timeliness of their response is shown in Fig. 1 . Most of these systems set the types of diseases under surveillance, and report the number of diseases covered, the geographical area covered, and the population covered. However, the time delay allowed is from 24 h to a week, except that [18, 20] , and the proposed EDICTS are on-line. There is generally one-way communication, i.e. from medical institutions to CDC, and only EDICTS is real-time and with automatic reporting, while [20] , for example, is done manually and by telephone. The implementation of an ""All-In-One"" Taiwanese NHI-IC card came into effect on 1st July 2003 in metropolitan and local community hospitals. The infrastructure was fully operational on a national scale and the first phase of implementation went into effect at the beginning of 2004. TBNHI constructed IDC to manage and maintain the NHICS database and a full-time bidirectional service network (the TBNHI intranet) for connecting all PoPs to IDC [22] . Moreover, the Taiwanese experience with SARS in 2003 proved that the health IC cards can play an important role in delivering solutions to healthcare providers and patients. The NHI-IC card carries a visually and electronically readable identifier to speed access to patient information. This leads to reductions in paper work, administrative costs and entry errors. The standard operations of using IC cards at the time of registration, at the doctor's side, and in the information infrastructure serve as a sound basis for better, faster delivery in the ENID reporting system. Moreover, the current practice of a surveillance system needs a real-time mechanism for quick spreading epidemic diseases. EDICTS is thus an appropriate mechanism that utilizes the NHICS infrastructure, in accordance with CDC policy, to deliver real-time response to ENID.",29.59764471277619,11.764079880155709

This will offer critical information to inform epidemiological intervention, but will require a willingness to invest in scientific infrastructure, healthcare, and training of local staff in the affected countries 94 . The need for immediate analysis and the growth of open sharing of sequence data means the challenge in genomic studies may be moving from data acquisition to analysis and interpretation. However, it is also the case that in-country real-time sequencing was not established until relatively late in the West African epidemic 19, 23, 25, 26, 93 , when case numbers had already begun to decline. In addition, many of the genome sequences were obtained in the absence of strong clinical and epidemiological metadata, such as the precise geographical location from where the sample was obtained, whether the individual survived the infection, and the time to the onset of symptoms. While it may be difficult to obtain such data during a rapidly developing outbreak, this limits the usefulness of genomic sequencing data in addressing a number of central biological questions, such as the virological basis to any variation in disease presentation and the evolution of pathogen virulence.

From the outset, the causative agent was thought to be viral, with most patients reporting fever or dyspnea [9, 11] . With unprecedented numbers of individuals under travel restrictions or quarantine, worldwide spread, and no known cure or vaccine yet available, COVID-19 has proven a formidable adversary [12, [13] [14] [15] .",28.669248727849947,10.19941317067756

Most coronaviruses cause diseases in their particular host species; 1 those that can infect humans through cross-species transmission have become an important threat to public health. Two serious coronavirus disease outbreaks have happened in the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, 2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. 3 Since December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognised as the causal factor in a series of severe cases of pneumonia originating in Wuhan in Hubei province, China. 4 This disease has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause disease via a mechanism analogous to the SARS coronavirus, with potential damage to vital organs such as lung, heart, liver, and kidney, and infection poses a considerable risk to patients by the high prevalence of pneumonia. 5 By March 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had led to 80 981 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, and 44 067 cases in 117 countries. 6 A cohort study of 44 672 Chinese cases reported that 2·1% of patients were younger than 20 years, and 1·2% were asymptomatic. 7 Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children. 8 Distinct immunological responses to viral infections can exist in children and result in severe damage to vital organs. 9 Although short-to-medium-term outcomes for children who recovered from SARS seemed good, the disease caused exercise impairment after more than 6 months. 10 A comprehensive literature search indicated that MERS was rare in children (31 cases identified between 2012 and 2016), 11 because transmission depends heavily on animal exposure and direct contact in the household or health-care facilities. Collectively, these two coronavirus diseases did not widely affect children because of the short-term epidemic of SARS and the strict transmission route of MERS. In a study of 15 children with COVID-19 (aged 4-14 years), six patients had small nodular ground-glass opacities in the lungs. 12 At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, all schools were on the spring festival holiday, which might have prevented children from exposure to transmission sources.

In the early stage of the epidemic, clinicians relied on the traditional nucleic acid detection kit as the most precise method for diagnosis; however, it is timeconsuming with an inherent low positive detection rate. As an alternative approach, a team led by Prof. Xueji Zhang and Prof. Xinchun Chen at Shenzhen University developed a chem-iluminescence-based antibody detection kit, which was successfully tested and put into use on February 4, 2020. 8 The kit is based on the enrichment and detection of IgM in serum and is suitable for clinical samples from patients with fevers in the past 7−14 days. It can complete the rapid diagnosis of coronavirus infection in as fast as 22 min, which greatly reduced the diagnosis time. Many other scientists in China have also been dedicated to the development of diagnostic methods. For example, a joint team led by Prof. Weihong Tan from Renji Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University and Hunan University has developed a new diagnostic method via portable RT-PCR-based molecular diagnostics. 9 At the center of the outbreak, a joint team led by Prof. Tiangang Liu at Wuhan University and Prof. Yan Li from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University developed a nanopore target sequencing (NTS) method to detect COVID-19 and other potential respiratory viruses simultaneously. By combining the advantages of long-read, real-time nanopore sequencing and target amplification, this approach allowed more sensitive detection than qPCR kits and could also monitor for mutation or other respiratory virus infections in test samples. 10 In addition to the academic community, scientists from industry with a background in chemical biology are also actively participating in the war against the epidemic. On January 25th, the first day of the Chinese New Year, an R&D team from a biotech company announced successful development of a rapid and sensitive detection system that only takes 9 min for pretreatment of 32 samples (Figure 2 ). With the combination of an automatic nucleic acid extraction instrument, the daily test capacity for a single technician can reach 1000 samples. The diagnosis kits have been utilized in over 10 Chinese provinces and used to test more than 100 000 clinical samples in the first 2 weeks of February alone. Dr. Lu Dong and Dr. Haiping Song are two leading scientists in this team, who previously graduated from the Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry at Peking University. Scientists in Hong Kong, one of the busiest international transportation hubs in China, are also dedicated to protecting their city through everything they can do. For example, Prof. Chi-Ming Che and Vivian Yam, two of the most famous It should be noted that the aforementioned work is only a part of the growing list of examples in fighting the virus on an invisible battlefield, and the global medical and scientific communities have been working tirelessly to put forth solutions to bring the current outbreak under control. Facing such a sudden and serious epidemic outbreak, we feel that scientific research is difficult to accomplish overnight, and many scientific studies cannot keep up with the fast spread of the virus. Global efforts from research institutions and pharmaceutical companies with a ""record breaking"" speed are highly desired in the arms race against the virus. To our delight, it only took a few days for remdesivir to enter clinical trials. A coherent effort from every section of the drug development chain made this fast track possible, which we hope can eventually turn into a life-saving therapy.",30.001944358626403,13.8563482358235

To limit the virus spread, those in the USA are canceling both smaller (∼100 people) and large meetings, researchers are limiting their travel both overseas and within the country, and student college and graduate school visit weekends are being postponed or stopped altogether. Still, there is much uncertainty about how to proceed and what other measures should be taken. Since the outbreak began in China, Chinese scientists have already faced many of the questions that those of us in other locations are now asking. We therefore asked several Chinese scientists to discuss the strategies that they are pursuing to limit the impact of the virus both on their research and on society. Some of the actions taken by the scientists and the government under this extreme situation may have a long-term influence and shift our future research and funding paradigm. We anticipate that their perspectives will be valuable to the community. global lifethreatening concern in recent days. The war against COVID-19 there has now reached the most critical moment, as confirmed COVID-19 cases have peaked for several days, and almost all the people in Wuhan City have been screened for suspected case identification (as of late February). We cannot imagine how people there are sacrificing to control the spread of COVID-19. As alumni of Wuhan University that is located in the center of Wuhan city, we became deeply saddened and worried as we watched the entire city cope with an unprecedented emergency situation. We wanted to provide a glimpse of what chemical biologists have been working on, from the perspective of scientists in China. In the past 40 days, we have heard more stories of hope and resilience than of worry and grief in China, where 1.4 billion people are doing their best to bring this serious outbreak under control. Right now, the epidemic situation outside Hubei is gradually improving, and the situation inside Hubei has shown signs of stabilization. It is noteworthy that although it is mandated that most people have to stay at home as a quarantine procedure, scientists in China have been increasingly devoted to combating COVID-19, with several clinical trials currently underway. As for scientists throughout the world, researchers in China are making extraordinary efforts toward rapid advancement of diagnostic and treatment approaches, and are doing so under highly challenging personal circumstances with extensive restrictions on not only travel, but day-to-day activities. As mentioned by WHO officers, Chinese scientists have been extremely professional in the face of this epidemic and have made their findings rapidly available to researchers around the world to coordinate global efforts to characterize, treat, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. One team led by Yongzhen Zhang from Fudan University completed the deep sequencing of COVID-19 and made its whole genome sequence publicly available on January 10, 2020. 1 Medical experts, virologists, structural biologists, and medicinal chemists have made significant contributions in areas such as epidemic prevention and control, patient treatment, virus classification and traceability, structure analysis, and clinical drug development. The current progress relied on the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the dedication of scientific researchers.

Lehours, A. Menard, J. Sarlangue, C. Laguente, C.H. Bebear, F. Megraud, B. De Barbeyrac (Bordeaux, FR) Objective: Whooping cough affects now young adults and teenagers, thus being able to contaminate infants unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. In this population, it evolves readily into atypical or severe forms difficult to diagnose and a biological confirmation is necessary. Thus molecular techniques represent invaluable tools. Here, we describe a real-time PCR assay for the identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in clinical specimens Methods: The available IS481 sequences of B. pertussis were aligned to identify conserved regions for the primer design. Primers for the detection of B. parapertussis were designed on the IS1001 sequence. A universal PCR targeting the 16S rDNA gene was also developed to be used as a control for extraction and for absence of PCR inhibitors. The PCR primers sets were tested on DNA extracted from the Bordetella species, and from diverse bacterial species commonly found in humans. The SYBR GreenÒ real-time PCR amplification and melting curve (Tm) analysis were carried out in an ABI PRISMÒ 7000 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems), and followed by a melting program. A retrospective study was performed on positive (n = 19) and negative (n = 13) nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). We tested prospectively 131 NPA received between April 2004 and November 2005. Results: When using the control strains, only DNA extracted from B. pertussis and B. parapertussis led to amplification, demonstrating the specificity of these two PCRs. Melting curve analysis of the amplicons from B. pertussis and B. parapertussis control strains exhibited Tm of approximately 79°C and 86°C, respectively. Serial dilutions of the extracted DNA from bacterial suspensions were tested using this assay and the regression curve was linear from 105 to 1 bacterial genome with slopes closed to that of the maximum efficiency. For the retrospective analysis, the 19 positive samples were all positive for B. pertussis, and no peak appeared for the 13 negative samples. Prospectively, this assay allowed the detection of 21 positive clinical samples (18 B. pertussis, 3 B. parapertussis), among these 14 could not have been isolated by culture. Conclusion: We have developed a new real-time PCR for the identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis targeting the IS sequences. This method, which uses the SYBR green chemistry and analysis of the melting point, is rapid, sensitive and specific, and can be easily implemented in a setting where a real time PCR apparatus is available.",20.0564329005014,9.997858896042494

Ohkusu, M. Komatsu, N. Ishiwada, T. Hoshino, N. Takeda, H. Sakata, T. Takeshima, T. Ezaki (Gifu, Nara, Chiba, Hokkaido, Shizuoka, JP) Objectives: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important etiologic agent of respiratory tract infections and is responsible for 10 to 20% of community-acquired pneumonia in adolescents and adults. M. pneumoniae is not sensitive to b-lactam antibiotics, which are often used for the empiric treatment of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are likely to improve the management of patients with M. pneumoniae infections. In this study, we evaluated a real-time NASBA assay for M. pneumoniae RNA in clinical specimens and compared it with real-time PCR. In addition, we developed a nylon membrane strip method for the rapid visual detection of nucleic acid hybridization. Methods: Respiratory specimens from 140 paediatric and adult patients with acute LRTI at five hospitals in Japan were included in this study. Nucleic acids were extracted using NucliSensÒ magnetic extraction kit (bioMérieux). Real-time NASBA assays were performed using NucliSensÒ basic kit and EasyQ analyser (bioMérieux) with primers OT2156NBK, OT2157 and a molecular beacon probe (Loens et al., J Clin Micobiol 2003, 41:4448-50) . For a reference method, real-time PCR using SYBR green I was performed on an iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad) as described by Morozumi et al. (J Infect Chemother 2004, 10:274-9) . Detection of NASBA amplified products on a nylon membrane strip was achieved by sandwich nucleic hybridization with two target-specific oligonucleotide probes, one for capture and the other for detection. The formation of sandwich complex, within 15 minutes, on the membrane strip resulted in a visually apparent aggregation of nucleic acid target and latex conjugated probes at the capture zone. Results: For both NASBA and PCR assays, 12 of the 140 specimens tested were positive and none of 128 PCR-negative clinical specimens were positive by real-time NASBA. The analytic sensitivity of the strip detection was 200-1000 copies of wild type in vitro-synthesized RNA generated by a 60 minutes NASBA amplification assay. All 12 positive specimens were positive by the visual strip detection in combination with NASBA. Conclusions: The sensitivity and specificity of the real-time NASBA were 100% using a real-time PCR assay as the standard. Furthermore, a combination of the NASBA assay and strip detection could facilitate the use of NASBA in resource-limited settings and in point-of-care testing.",19.82906839999557,9.644397000606359

The aims of this study were (i) to develop a real-time PCR based method able to differentiate the main Bartonella species involved in human endocarditis and in Cat Scratch Disease (CSD) (ii) to compare real-time PCR with conventional PCR for diagnosis of CSD. Methods: A real-time PCR assay, using a double hybridization probe format (Light Cycler) was developed. Identification and differentiation of Bartonella species was based on the amplification by real time PCR of a 205-bp fragment of the gltA gene followed by Tm determination. Conventional PCR targeted a 414-bp fragment of the htrA gene of B. henselae (i). We evaluated 113 samples (lymph node biopsy or cytopunctures) over a ten-year period. The patients were divided into three groups according to the number of positive diagnostic criteria for CSD: 23 patients with definite CSD (two or more classical criteria), 69 with possible CSD and 21 for whom another diagnosis was retained used as a control group. Results: Conventional PCR detected B. henselae only, whereas the real-time PCR method could detect and differentiate B. henselae, B. quintana, B. koehlerae, B. vinsonii, B. alsatica and B. berkhoffii. Specificity was 100% for the both assays. Sensitivity was 78% by both conventional and real-time PCR assays on samples from patients with definite CSD. Real-time PCR coupled to automate DNA extraction on the MagNA Pure robot (Roche) was less susceptible to inhibitors than manual extraction (6 vs.0 by MagNA Pure). Conclusion: This Light Cycler PCR assay was sensitive, specific, and less time consuming than conventional PCR. Therefore, real-time PCR analysis could be used for CSD diagnosis in combination with epidemiological, serological and histological criteria. Objectives: Pneumocystis jiroveci remains one of the important causes of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Detection of this fungus in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid using nested PCR has great sensitivity and specificity for diagnostics of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Because this two-step method is rather time consuming we decided to replace it by TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR targeting the neighbouring region of the same gene (mtLSU rRNA gene). Methods: Between VI/99 and X/2005, a total number of 266 BAL specimens of immunocompromised patients were tested using nested PCR assay. Forty-nine specimens (18,4%) were P. jiroveci positive. Twenty-nine P. jiroveci positive and 10 negative specimens were retested using novel real-time PCR assay. Results of both methods were compared and detected copy numbers were correlated to clinical findings. Results: There was absolute concordance between positive and negative results obtained by both methods. The real-time PCR assay is able to detect< 10 copies of a plasmid standard per tube and it has the same sensitivity as the nested PCR. The copy numbers of the target gene in positive samples varied between 6 and 139534 copies per tube; median was 121 copies per tube. The 29 positive patients that were retrospectively clinically evaluated could be divided into 3 groups: (i) 15 (51.7%) patients with PCP had median copy number of 4766 (range 12 -139534) copies per tube, (ii) 6 (20.7%) patients with polymicrobial pneumonia (P. jiroveci + another pathogen) had median copy number of 334 (range 13 -11237) copies per tube and iii) 8 (27.6%) patients without PCP had median copy number of 70 (range 6 -138) copies per tube. Conclusions: We developed a rapid and sensitive real-time PCR assay for detection of P. jiroveci. Using this assay, we are able to obtain results in about 4 hours from sample delivery, contrary to 6 hours that are necessary for nested PCR. Moreover this assay seems to discriminate patients with PCP and P. jiroveci carriers. Certainly, more samples must be tested to determine the cut-off values more precisely. This work was supported by Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic (grant no. NR/8452-3). Objective: Laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough, is not well standardized. Different PCR systems have been developed for the detection of Bordetella pertussis, mainly based on insertion sequences (IS) as target region. IS show copy numbers of up to 250 per cell, which makes these systems highly sensitive? However, IS are transposable DNA elements, capable of horizontal transfer across species and of spontaneous elimination. These are characteristics that tend to compromise specificity of PCR based diagnostic systems. The goal of this work was to develop and to evaluate a highly sensitive, absolute specific and reliable IVD assay, based on Real-Time PCR technology for the detection and differentiation of the human pathogenic Bordetella species B. pertussis, B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica. Methods: We developed an IS-independent PCR system for the simultaneous detection of B. pertussis, B. paraperussis and B. bronchiseptica and the differentiation of these species by melting curve analysis using the LightCycler Instrument (Roche Diagnostics). We combined this system with an IS-dependent (IS481/IS1001) PCR system and an Internal Control (IC) PCR. Testing type strains of all known Bordetella species, different clinical isolates of human pathogenic Bordetella species and about 50 different bacterial, viral and fungal isolates validated specificity. The analytical and clinical sensitivity of the assay was evaluated by Probit analysis and by testing over 200 clinical specimens by different laboratories. Results: We were able to develop a one tube Real-Time PCR assay for the detection and differentiation of B. pertussis, B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica. An Internal Control was also implemented into the system. Testing DNA preparations of all known Bordetella species and of viral, bacterial and fungal isolates, either closely related to Bordetella or causing similar symptoms observed no cross-reactivity. The analytical sensitivity of the assay for B. pertussis determined by Probit analysis is 1.3 copies/ll (p £ 0.05). Clinical sensitivity and specificity was demonstrated by testing over 200 clinical specimens. Conclusion: We could demonstrate that our new Real-Time PCR assay for the detection and differentiation of human pathogenic Bordetella species combines the high sensitivity of Insertion Sequence based PCR systems with the reliable specificity of a IS independent PCR system and the security of an Internal Control in a single reaction. Objectives: Evaluation of a nucleic acid amplification procedure for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumoniae in respiratory tract specimens. Methods: Using RNA as the principal target, amplification was performed with NASBA reagents from the NucliSens Basic Kit and in-house produced primers and molecular beacon probes. Internal Control (IC) RNAs were developed to monitor the procedures at the individual sample level. For nucleic acid extraction from respiratory samples, the NucliSens miniMAG method based on magnetic silica was used. Methods were evaluated on sputa, bronchus aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavages and throat swab samples from patients with CAP. Results: For respiratory samples, optimal IC RNA input levels were established as a compromise between reliable detection of the IC RNA and minimal effect on the sensitivity for the detection of pathogen RNA. Both IC RNAs were spiked into the samples and nucleic acid extraction was followed by amplification in duplicate with either of the primer/beacon combinations. Sensitivity, defined as the 90% hit rate, was found to be 60 copies of RNA per extraction for Chlamydia pneumoniae and 130 copies for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Successful nucleic acid extraction was reflected by efficient IC RNA amplification. Only incidentally, invalid results were obtained, most of which could be resolved by a second amplification analysis of the nucleic acid extract. A total of 15 samples was found positive (9 for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 6 for Chlamydia pneumoniae), 14 of which could be confirmed by a second molecular method. Conclusions: Real-time NASBA amplification in potential is a valuable tool for the molecular diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Multiple amplification analyses, each with its own IC RNA, can be performed on a single nucleic acid extract. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the clinical value of these methods.",18.759467930321975,9.228595365836004

Franzin, D. Cabodi, N. Bonfrate, F. Tortorelli (Turin, IT) Objectives: Culture is the gold standard for the diagnosis of Legionella infection. However several days are required to obtain a positive result. DNA techniques are promising for rapid detection. In this study a real time (RT)-PCR system was evaluated for the direct detection of Legionella from clinical samples and compared to culture. Methods: Culture and RT-PCR was performed on 78 respiratory samples (10 sputum, 44 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 19 bronchial aspirate, 5 lung tissue) from 76 patients with pneumonia. Legionella infection (LD) was confirmed in 23 patients by positivity to at least one of these tests: urine antigen detection (ELISA), serology (fourfold rise in antibody titres by indirect immunofluorescence and/or micro agglutination test) and culture. Aliquots of the untreated, heattreated and acid-washed samples were plated on BCYE, BMPA and MWY. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 15 days. Blood samples from 11 symptomatic old patients involved in an LD outbreak were also examined. RT-PCR for L.pneumophila (Lp) and Legionella spp (L.spp) was performed after DNA extraction with iCycler and BIO-RAD reagents, according to a modified protocol. Results: Culture from respiratory samples was positive from 17 patients. Lp serogroup 1 was isolated from 15 subjects, Lp 3 from one and L.bozemanii from another. RT-PCR was positive in a total of 25 (32%) samples. 24/25 (96%) samples from LD patients were positive by RT-PCR, while 52/53 (98%) samples from patients without LD were negative. Discrepancy was observed in only one case (1.3%) for category of patients with and without LD. Three patients with proven LD was positive by RT-PCR for L. spp and negative for Lp, but one of these was culture positive for L.bozemanii. All culture positive respiratory samples were RT-PCR positive, except one where Lp3 was isolated. Concordance for respiratory samples was 97.4%. All blood culture samples were negative, while RT-PCR was positive from 4/6 outbreak patients with laboratory confirmed LD and from 5/5 patients with clinical, but not laboratory confirmed, LD. Conclusion: Laboratory diagnosis LD is better achieved by combined urine antigen detection, serology and culture. Results of this study showed good concordance between the criterion based on traditional methods and RT-PCR. This new sensitive technique, that needs to be further evaluated, offers the advantage of a rapid diagnosis.",12.878588194004644,8.81001329225618

We also wanted to determine the prevalence of M. genitalium in patients, both men and women, visiting a STI clinic in a rural area in the west of Sweden. Methods: First void urine (FVU) and/or urethral swab were collected from 381 men and from 298 women, FVU and/or cervical swab and/or urethral swab were collected. Two hundred and fifteen specimens were used in the PCR comparative study, 100 consecutive specimens, and 36 consecutive specimens from patients with symptoms of urethritis and 79 specimens from patients positive for M. genitalium by real time MgPa PCR in the prevalence study. True-positive samples were defined as a specimen positive in any two PCR assays. Results: The prevalence of M. genitalium infection in men and women were 27/381 (7.1%) and 23/298 (7.7%), respectively. In the PCR comparative study, M. genitalium DNA were detected in 59/62 (95.2 %) by conventional 16S rRNA PCR, 52/62 (83.9 %) by real time 16S rRNA PCR and in 62/62 (100 %) by real time MgPa PCR of true-positive specimens. M. genitalium DNA were detected in an additional 12 specimens with real time MgPa PCR. Four of these specimens were from women with another true-positive sample. An additional 2 specimens, also from women with another true-positive sample, were detected with conventional 16S rRNA PCR. Conclusion: Real time MgPa PCR indicates slightly higher sensitivity compared to conventional 16S rRNA PCR and increased sensitivity compared to real time 16S rRNA PCR for detection of M. genitalium DNA. The prevalence of 7.1 % in men and 7.7 % in women attending a STI clinic is in concordance with other Swedish studies.",17.679413548103682,8.778597614017228

Methods: A total of 1000 faecal specimens obtained consecutively from individual patients of Thessalia (Central Greece) were included in this study. Genomic DNA extractions were performed by use of commercially available isolation kits, while the commercial kit described above, according to the instructions of the manufacturer did real-time PCR. Results obtained from Real-Time PCR assay were compared with bacterial culture results to determine sensitivity and specificity. Results: According to the results obtained by Real-Time PCR, fifty-three of 1000 faecal specimens were positive for Salmonella spp. Salmonella was detected by bacterial cultures in all, except two, the positive specimens. Repetition of two negative cultures after enrichment detected the pathogenic micro organisms. The mean time for the detection of Salmonella by Real-Time PCR was approximately 5-6 hours, while detection by traditional culture methods required 2-3 days.

In this study, we report the evaluation of a real-time PCR assay targeting the IS6110 element and the RD9 specific region as a tool to rapidly diagnose and differentiate M. tuberculosis and M. canetti (IS6110 positive or negative -RD9 positive) from the other mycobacterial species included in the M. tuberculosis complex (IS6110 positive -RD9 negative) such as M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum, M. microti, M. caprae and M. pinnipedii. Methods: The performances of the assay were assessed from 166 clinical samples collected from patients over a two months period. DNA preparations and amplifications were carried out with a new kit developed by BioRad (Bio-Rad Real Time TB Assay), following the manufacturer's instructions. An internal control was added before DNA extraction in order to measure the efficiency of DNA recovery and check for the absence of inhibitors. Results: The BioRad Real Time TB assay correctly identified 17 specimens that were proven by culture to contain M.tuberculosis, of which 16 were positive for IS6110 and RD9 and 1 was positive for RD9 but negative for IS6110. Seven samples IS6110-positive but RD9-negative was shown by culture to contain M. bovis (n = 6) or M. africanum (n = 1). Eight samples that remained culture-negative were found to be positive to either IS6110-based amplification (n = 2) or RD9-based amplification (n = 3) or both (n = 3). Finally, 131 of the 134 samples negative for both IS6110 and RD9-based amplifications remained negative on culture, the three culture-positive amplification-negative samples yielding only a few colonies of M. tuberculosis on culture. Conclusions: The assay, based on the real-time amplification of three distinct targets (IS6110, RD9 and Internal Control) was found to be robust, sensitive and specific, and is characterised by a complementary pattern of identification: broad for the IS6110based amplification and specific of M.tuberculosis and M.canetti for the RD9-based amplification.",16.508443001675356,8.576582141040475

False positive results due to contamination and false negative results due to e.g. antibiotic treatment at the time of sampling are well known problems. Nucleic acid target amplification (PCR) could potentially supplement traditional BC. Objective: To compare a new commercially available broadrange real-time PCR assay (SeptiFast) with BC for detection of bacteria and fungi in blood from patients with suspected sepsis or SIRS. SeptiFast detects a total of 23 pathogen species. Methods: A BC sample (32-40 ml) was obtained using sterile technique. Immediately after, a 5 ml blood sample was obtained for PCR. At the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital, BC (BactAlert, BioMerioux) was performed according to standard operating procedures. PCR (SeptiFast, Roche Diagnostics) was performed according to the manufacturers' description using a MagNA Lyser and LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics). Results: A total of 114 episodes (combined BC samples and PCR samples) were collected from 114 patients. 83 episodes were negative in both BC and PCR and 21 episodes were positive in one or both assays. 13 episodes were BC positive, yielding 13 BC isolates (positive rate for non contaminant BC: 7.9%). Two isolates were not included in the PCR panel and three isolates were considered as contamination. Of the remaining seven isolates available for direct comparison, PCR detected five. 15 episodes were PCR positive (positive rate for non contaminant PCR: 11.4%), detecting a total of 19 microorganisms. Two of the detected microorganisms were considered as contamination, six were also detected by BC, but 11 were not detected by BC. Of these 11 PCR ± BC-isolates, six were confirmed by culture of the same micororganism from a clinical relevant anatomical site and five could not be confirmed by culture. The combined tests had a positive rate for non-contaminants of 15.8%. In the six episodes positive by both PCR and BC, PCR would reveal species identification in approx 18 hours if performed on a daily basis. BC had an average delay of 2 days until Gram stain, and 3-4 days until species identification. Conclusion: This study shows SeptiFast PCR to be a valuable add-on to conventional BC for detection of bacteria and fungi in blood.",12.58658560554328,7.452585446378091

Although the majority of these patients presents with typical symptoms like abrupt onset of fever, rigors, sweats, prominent headache, and couch, about 18 percent do not show any respiratory symptoms. Culture is difficult and time consuming. Isolates of C. psittaci are highly infectious and the isolates should be handled under bio-safety level 3 conditions. Molecular techniques like real time PCR are therefore ideal alternatives for the detection of C. psittaci to aid the diagnosis of psittacosis. Methods: We developed an internally controlled real time PCR system that targeted the ribosomal intergenic spacer of C. psittaci. The PCR assay was validated on a set of clinical samples from serologically confirmed patients with psittacosis and controls. Results: Using this PCR system we detected an outbreak of psittacosis among members of a veterinary unit. One of these members was admitted to ICU because of multi organ failure. Conclusion: With a new developed real-time PCR for C. psittaci we were able to identify three patients with psittacosis related to a common source. The symptoms of the patients varied from mild to severe.

It took about 10 minutes per one test, which is one third shorter than the conventional screening process. The main time-consuming factor in the conventional COVID-19 screening system is the time required for ventilation and cleaning of the specimen collection room. Designed as an airborne infection isolation room with 12 air changes/hour, it takes around 30 minutes to achieve airborne-contaminant removal efficiency over 99%, and even longer if surface disinfection with sodium hypochlorite is performed.8 However, this time for ventilation and cleaning is not required for the DT screening system because testees' cars are used as specimen collection rooms. At DT screening centers, around 100 tests can be done per day and about four to eight persons are required depending on the design of workflow. The flow can be simplified as two booths of registration/questionnaire/examination/instruction and specimen collection, which requires minimized manpower and PPE consumption. In addition to the improved efficiency, the DT screening system can also exclude the risk of cross-infection between testees at the waiting space of conventional screening centers, for testees' own cars work as isolation units throughout the test course.",30.475099961626242,11.789584909735817

To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using the available information. For the probability of certain public health events, risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC risk assessment was categorized into 5 levels (“very low,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high”), and overall risk was determined [4]. The emergence of COVID-19, which started as clusters of pneumonia with unknown etiology in China at the end of 2019, was unique and thus, a good example for KCDC to conduct a series of risk assessments to evaluate the potential risk of importation, transmission, and the impact at the country-level.

WHO reported that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and chosen by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January. (1) During the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom (2) . As of 17 March 2020, according to Iranian health authorities, there had been 988 COVID-19 deaths in Iran with more than 16,000 confirmed infections(3,4,5) This respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus is one of the leading causes for serious illnesses in people all over the world. According to the global statistics of fatalities caused by coronavirus, and its spread in Iran, it is vital and essential to forecast its outbreak by a model. As the outbreak of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), is a worldwide pandemic, it is rapidly expanding in Iran, real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. Previously, real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility, severity, and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak, such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola. Analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters, such as the incubation and infectious periods, and delays between infection and detection, isolation, and reporting of cases. However, official individual patient data rarely become publicly available, when the information is most needed. This is an analysis of the COVID-19 out-break in Iran. In this population-level observational study, I used the Iranian Ministry of Health reports downloaded from GitHub, an online data-sharing platform. This dataset is updated on a daily basis with a 24 hour delay.

Artemis Comparative Tool (ACT) was used to analyze human Coronavirus (HCov-HKU1) reference sequence vs. Wuhan-Hu-1 COVID-19. Results obtained (Fig.2) revealed extensive mutation among the tested genomes. New genes; ORF8 and ORF6; were found inserted in COVID-19 which were absent in HCov-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission [71] . High rate of mutation between the two genomes were observed in the region from 20000 bp to the end of the sequence. This region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and spike (S) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [72, 73] .",20.328072016298584,10.283237908980185

Dealing with issues such as missing data and inconsistent records will be a key challenge in using these data for prospective real-time analysis. Despite these challenges, we show the potential of digital surveillance tools to 1) inform early detection, 2) characterise the spread, and 3) forecast the future trajectory of outbreaks. Particularly in an evolving outbreak scenario, when information from traditional surveillance is limited and only available with a significant delay, digital surveillance data can be used to complement the information gap. For instance, during the West African Ebola epidemic, the first situation report by the WHO was published only at the end of August 2014 [27] , reporting on cases between January and August 2014. On the other hand, the first post on ProMED on Ebola cases in Guinea appeared in March 2014 [28] .

To further develop such approaches, it is important to establish an automated pipeline from data collection to curation to analysis, which currently requires manual intervention at each of these steps. Another factor that could enhance the usability of our model in near real time is to improve the running time of the fitting and forward simulation. In the current implementation, the running time varies from approximately 0.5 CPU hours when 100 days of incidence data are being used to approximately 335 CPU hours using 462 days of incidence data using a 3.3 GHz Intel Xeon X5680 processor.
